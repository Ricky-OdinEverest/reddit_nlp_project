9,Destiny,"So, couple of years ago i had a girlfriend, we were together for over a year and one night we were alone on my cottage just the two of us, we were both kinda drunk and we had sex, it felt normal foreplay was natural we went into it like every other sex, it was kinda underwhelming but mostly because both of us were kinda tired and drunk. She never said anything about it, we were together for 3 more months, fast forward to year later, she starts telling people i raped her that night. She never said no, but she didn't say yes because after a year in a relationship the transition into sex is obviously natural, she said that she didn't want it inside but she didn't verbally say it in the moment. Her body language was not out of the ordinary but we were both kinda drunk so i may have misread it.

13,Destiny,"Are you not responsible for your own actions when you're drunk? You don't absolve yourself of accountability by claiming to be blackout drunk if you drive a car and kill someone, or otherwise injure or kill someone or damage property. You are still responsible for your own actions. 

So if you're at a bar by yourself and you get blackout drunk, and you go home with someone you never met before, how can that qualify as rape? You cannot absolve yourself of liability/accountability/responsibility by getting blackout drunk. It's a stupid argument. 

I live in Norway, and tons of people here don't talk to people when they're sober, and they go out to drink and meet random people to hook up with all the time. When that's part of the culture, you gotta be held responsible for your own actions, even if you're drunk. I think it should be like this everywhere.   
If you regret your decisions the following day, it's still not rape. YOU chose to get blackout drunk, and YOU agreed to go home with the other person. You're responsible for yourself!

Imagine if people didn't feel shame over fucking someone they wanted to fuck while drunk, but not when they're sober. Imagine if you just count it as a bad decision and learn from it, and avoid being blackout drunk by yourself in the future! 

And before anyone thinks I'm trying to excuse myself with this, I've only been with 3 women in my life. My wife, the mother of my first 2 kids, and the mother of my 3rd kid.

60,Destiny,"So Destiny finally took the step to try and set up his compressor so that we won't lose hearing when Destiny does his iconic screaming at Discord icons. But today on stream Destiny was complaining that the compressor was turning up *everything* that entered the mic and took it out on poor Melina just trying to be a good trad-wife and do some laundry. 

Here is a guide on how Destiny can set up his mic for optimal results hopefully without peaking or domestic abuse. Maybe he has already fixed it and I'm writing this all for nothing, but it's worth a shot.

**Threshold**

This knob should be at 0 ±  or maybe -3-. In the world of digital audio peaks in a digital format is a nasty ordeal and a no-no and anything above 0 db in a digital audio format is undesirable. To stay safe it should be at -3, but  0 ± should be fine.

**Ratio**

So this is where the magic happens. This should be at  ∞ . This turns the compressor into a *limiter* with the function of limiting any and all peaks above the threshold which is the effect we're after here. This prevents peaking and should save X amount of peoples ears whenever volumes get loud enough to pass the set threshold.

**Gain/Makeup Gain**

Leave this knob alone. It should be at 0. I assume turned this knob a bit which increased the volume for everything and made Destiny hear that nasty nasty washing machine now more loudly than before. 

If Destiny is hearing things louder now that means the compressor is working constantly which is *not* desirable in this instance and all we want is for the compressor/limiter kick in and be active when the volume reaches the threshold and to remove any signal that goes above said threshold.

Hopefully this fixes Destiny's issues and if it doesn't I suck I guess.",Destiny hasn't set up his compressor correctly and it's affecting his personal relationships and I'm here to help,1668462288,"Destiny hasn't set up his compressor correctly and it's affecting his personal relationships and I'm here to help So Destiny finally took the step to try and set up his compressor so that we won't lose hearing when Destiny does his iconic screaming at Discord icons.

Here is a guide on how Destiny can set up his mic for optimal results hopefully without peaking or domestic abuse. Maybe he has already fixed it and I'm writing this all for nothing, but it's worth a shot.

**Threshold**

This knob should be at 0 ±  or maybe -3-. In the world of digital audio peaks in a digital format is a nasty ordeal and a no-no and anything above 0 db in a digital audio format is undesirable. To stay safe it should be at -3, but  0 ± should be fine.

**Ratio**

So this is where the magic happens. This should be at  ∞ . This turns the compressor into a *limiter* with the function of limiting any and all peaks above the threshold which is the effect we're after here. This prevents peaking and should save X amount of peoples ears whenever volumes get loud enough to pass the set threshold.

**Gain/Makeup Gain**

Leave this knob alone. It should be at 0. I assume turned this knob a bit which increased the volume for everything and made Destiny hear that nasty nasty washing machine now more loudly than before. 

If Destiny is hearing things louder now that means the compressor is working constantly which is *not* desirable in this instance and all we want is for the compressor/limiter kick in and be active when the volume reaches the threshold and to remove any signal that goes above said threshold.

Hopefully this fixes Destiny's issues and if it doesn't I suck I guess."

66,Destiny,"# THE ""GOT RHYTHM"" MANIFESTO

The ""Got Rhythm"" game played by Destiny on stream, hosted on *concerthotels.com*, is a **FRAUD**. 

While messing around with the game, I found a major issue with its implementation that makes it completely pointless, deceptive, and non-competitive. There is another smaller, but still annoying, issue that I also look at afterwards. In the following 'festo, I describe these issues, how I found them, and why they make the game a fraud. Finally, I make a couple suggestions for getting around these problems.

&amp;nbsp;

### ISSUE ONE: *RANDOM SCORING*

**This game throws off the scoring of your timing by a seemingly random small amount of milliseconds.**

*Seriously?*

Yes. The first thing that is important to understand is the way the scoring functions. The game measures how well your timing was by looking at the time between every two of your clicks. It does *not* measure your timing against a ""hidden beat"" that continues playing through the run. You can test this by following the beat for like 5 clicks, waiting a bunch of time, then continuing again at around the same pace. You will see that your score is negatively affected *only* on the beat where you waited a bunch of time, instead of on every single click after the pause.

Why is this important? 

Because when you use an **auto clicker**, you may not time it correctly initially - however, with this scoring system, it means that you should get a completely flat line, since the timing between the clicks is machine-perfect.

That is not what we see.

[Auto clicker with 500 ms interval](https://imgur.com/a/2kbnnxM)

[Auto clicker with 460 ms interval (closer to the *actual* interval, which isn't 500 ms for some reason)](https://imgur.com/a/mbwfCjo)

So either the auto clicker is clicking at slightly random intervals, or the game is adding this randomness to our scores on purpose. I tested this with a macro on Logitech G Hub, and with ""OP Auto Clicker"", making sure no random intervals were activated on either of them.

I don't understand who the fuck thought this was a good idea. So disappointing.


&amp;nbsp;

### ISSUE TWO: *NON-PERFECT DRUM LOOP*

While trying the game a bunch I noticed that the drum kick metronome that plays at the start will sometimes suddenly ""skip"" slightly. So I recorded 4 minutes of the drum beat, dropped it into FL Studio and saw that it's actually a 32.05 second recording that loops. Yes, *.05*, because the recording has *50 milliseconds of nothing* attached to the very end of the 32 second loop. 

Apart from being an ugly way of implementing a looping kick drum, if you get unlucky, this can easily throw you off when trying to time your taps before the kick fades out. This issue is not as important but it's somehow infuriating too.


&amp;nbsp;

### SOLUTION

My suggestion is making our own Got Rhythm game with these issues resolved and hosting it on destiny.gg. 

It could even have a DGG Leaderboard. We'd need to have some clever anti-cheating measures, though, such as a way to detect auto clickers, or also randomizing the BPM between 115 - 125 in decimals (milliseconds), for every run. This could be a fun way to compete amongst ourselves, we could even align our accounts with either PEPE or YEE to see which faction has the best rhythm (kind of pointless though, because YEE neva lose). 

This would be a bunch of work and I don't feel like doing it, so if anyone is up for it and D-man approves, it could be cool!","THE ""GOT RHYTHM"" MANIFESTO",1668459534,"THE ""GOT RHYTHM"" MANIFESTO # THE ""GOT RHYTHM"" MANIFESTO

87,Destiny,"last stream Dan asked Steven if he thought that he can clock gay people and how there was some study showing that you could indeed do that. I'm assuming that he is remembering [this study](https://psyarxiv.com/hv28a/). The tldr there basically is that the authors trained a machine learning model on a bunch of very unethically sourced selfies and their sexual orientation and were able to make one that correctly identifies them with about 2/3 to 3/4 accuracy. They then claim that this is because sexual orientation is correlated to physiology.

In order to see how that is very misleading at best and completely wrong at worst you need to look at the exact methodology. The first detail is that the percentages used in the study don't tell you how often the model correctly identifies the sexuality from a photo, but how often it correctly identifies which photo is of a gay person given one of a gay and one of a straight person. this isn't a huge deal, but it is a very different interpretation than what I'd assume average ppl would expect.  
The much bigger problem is that the study worked with photos scraped from a dating site. As such they can't actually tell if the model is picking up on facial features as they claim or is instead just picking up on cultural differences in how ppl take photos of themselves. [This](https://medium.com/@blaisea/do-algorithms-reveal-sexual-orientation-or-just-expose-our-stereotypes-d998fafdf477) article from a machine learning researcher goes into detail about this. The tldr is that you can easily make ""models"" that are as good at identifying gay women as the ones in the study by eg choosing randomly if both or neither wear eye shadow and otherwise saying the one with it is straight. Obviously this is not actually identifying gay people and just identifying a somewhat well known cultural trend.

[A further study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10739.pdf) essentially replicated the original study's results. But this time they also trained a model on highly blurred versions of the photos. and by highly blurred they mean literal 5 by 5 pixels! surprisingly this model also achieved similar accuracy, even further suggesting that the original study was not actually telling if someone is gay or not but just some incredibly superficial fact about the photo composition.

So to answer Dan's question, Steven is essentially right on this (which we should have expected since it's not a food take), you can sorta tell if someone is gay _as long as they are presenting themselves in a stereotypically gay fashion_.",On whether you can clock gay people,1668456081,"On whether you can clock gay people last stream Dan asked Steven if he thought that he can clock gay people and how there was some study showing that you could indeed do that.

We should all be able to agree with this statement because it's a fact.

The issue is when people say this and people push back by talking about socioeconomic reasons and slavery and how maybe they don't have proper education which leads them to crime. 

Is that true? Yeah. Does it change the fact that they're in jail more from crimes? No. Someone who's talking about police or crimes in neighborhoods isn't going to suddenly change their mind because you say WHY it's happening. Because it doesn't change that it is happening. 

2. Jews are over represented in media.
Is this true? Yes. Most people agree it's true but it's also pushed back with ""you're implying a secret cabal and calling them evil"" or ""insert reason Dan said the other day""

Again all of these reasons don't change the simple observation that there's a lot in media. It's not nefarious to observe something.

If you say this people freak out talking about how it's social conditioning and American women aren't used to it so they don't know better.

And again. Those reasons don't change what's true.

Yes. You can. 
These things are true regardless of the reasoning why.

If someone states these facts and you push back by telling them they're wrong that's one thing.
But when you tell them they're wrong then explain they're actually right they just don't understand WHY it comes off as dismissive and makes them think you're being dishonest.

It's not hard to bite factual bullets.

When you constantly push back on true statements it comes off as Weasley and disingenuous and looks like you aren't properly engaging. It's dismissive.

Why something happens doesn't change the fact that it happens. There's times and arguments to go into detail about why something is true. I'm not saying to completely always ignore it. But it's okay to sometimes just acknowledge observations.

This is it.

I’ve taken a couple days to think, away from the internet, away from my home and computer, spoken to multiple professionals and have decided to close this casket publically. Before I do, I want to be clear and concise in what I’ve learned and felt over the past week. An announcement:

I will not be streaming anymore. Effective immediately and possible indefinetly. I will perhaps participate in some debates, sparingly andas a guest appearance, but my focus will be on my YouTube channel, developing my own body of content. Im not built for this panel world. I am too aggressive to be as sensitive as I am. I make a fool of myself, I lose my message. I don’t navigate social situations well as an autistic person, and I don’t have enough practice under my belt to be able to responsibly put myself in tricky social situations in stream. Maybe some day. Probably not, though.

ILL BE ON THIS PATREON THOUGH. . (Twitter probably needs to go, but I can not part with it

This world has taken up my life. To my detriment, I have worked hard.

I’m addicted to approval, I’m addicted to proving myself. All of this hurts me. I couldn’t stop. I have to stop.

I have dreams outside of the online that I need to pursue.

Overall, the narcissistic world of entertainment, has not bode me well. I left the music industry for the same reason. Something I thought was fun, turned into an ego feed, turned in to self harm, turned in to me spiraling. I don’t want to be famous. I don’t want these many eyes on me. It hurts. But It’s addicting. To someone like me, who grew up without parents, to have eyes on me, the potential for love, the potential to prove im worthy of attention and adoration and love……it’s heroin. But I can’t get that from you guys, ultimately. It’s fickle. I can only get that from me.

But without further ado, what you all came for.

I don’t care about the safety of keeping this inside my mouth and chest. Do your worst. I have nothing left to lose.

It sucks to come out. It does. It sucks to be a woman who comes out about someone bigger than you. This is my second time. Unfortunately men in power or with big platforms seem to have a propensity to abuse it.

This time is different. This time for a week straight, day and night I had hundreds of thousands of people trying to gaslight me or just downright hurling abuse at me.

Going public with sexual instances is embarrassing, and even more embarrassing when someone tries to come forward with that information for you.

People have decided to relay my personal story with Steven, that I told to a friend privately.

I should not trust friends online.

And I’m going to lay it out for you concisely…. and I’m never going to speak of it again. Steven and I did not have sex. We hooked up. I was nervous because I’d not been with many uncircumcised men. He was fine with that.

I went home after, I felt good about what had happened.

I did not open my relationship for Steven, I did not close it because of Steven.

What I didn’t anticipate was becoming part of stevens orbit in the way I had. I did not knowingly consent to a scenario Of being evaluated for my performance, being told I brought views and clicks and content, and existing in the social contract I did, after having a sexual dynamic with him, and I didn’t realize how many of the women in the orbit had the same social contract I did.

This was enough to just make me feel, strange.

Another thing that made me feel strange was when I begged Steven to do as little as tell him community to go easier on me on the platforms he could control. He deletes some of his fans critism of him on the Reddit, I thought it would be easy. Apparently, it wasn’t. And I was publically embarrassed for weeks, being gaslit that I couldn’t take accountability for how dumb and irritating and annoying I was, and I just had to admit all of those things and then we’d reevaluate. Steven even said I was using DARVO abuse tactics when I was expressing my feelings.

The thing that made me feel the weirdest was finding out Steven was sexting and still seeking sex from Ana, who for years he publically embarrassed and acknowledged was not only “crazy” but also completely obsessed with him and the consensus in the community has been she’s a psycho stalker and stevens done little to nothing to quell that idea and exploit Ana’s sobs and mental breakdown for views.

This, is abusive. It was the cherry on top that nobody knew about it, and the nuts sprinkled over everything was that Ana told me she felt like she had to do it in order to feel safe from Steven.

this resonated.

The first time Steven and I spoke off stream, he decided to tell me this huge “career ending”\*secret, and I bartered with my own secret. He’d alluded to it in messages, baiting me. And I had to know. We were strangers, and he told me.

\*there’s nothing career ending about this secret. Not for him: it’s why he so often teases it. He wears it like a badge of honor. He smiles every time he brings it up on stream. He laughed while telling me.

I’m not keeping an abusers secrets. I’m done.

It was about sexual indiscretions about someone other than his wife. An affair, his wife didn’t know the extent of. And he said he was never going to tell her. He didn’t want to ruin anything because he had jumped the gun and broken up with Melina before he knew this other woman had wanted him. She didn’t, and he went back. I thought, okay this is not really my business and I don’t know Melina.

Steven says he doesn’t care if this gets out because it only hurts the other woman. He’s said this on stream multiple times. So, alas. I’m not going to mention the other woman because this has nothing to do with her.

And here I am, a stranger, holding this secret. Me, a stranger, pleading with him to tell his wife about his misconduct. I say secrets hurt people, resentment builds, he assures he’s fine and will probably never tell her. I ask if this is going to affect him, he repeats for the 70th time to me, he is a sociopath and he doesn’t and won’t care.

Make no mistake. He wants people to know this secret. He wants to embarrass Melina and the other woman involved. It’s why he teases it on stream. It’s why he tells every orbiter , it why he told me. A stranger he wanted to have sex with. People with secrets they don’t want people to know do not tease it on a stream with 15k people.

A day or two before meeting in person we spoke on the phone again, and I had asked him about his relationship history because it seemed very toxic to me, being that he was cheating on his wife and the only other public relationships I knew of, online, were toxic. And he told me this really fun story of this time he and his ex worked together and he was sleeping with another co-worker. His ex went to all of their boss to tell him Steven was sleeping with a coworker and he lied to his boss about it, denying it, saying she was a psycho and psychotic and she sobbed and freaked out in the office, and got fired. And he liked it. And they continued to have sex, and brought up the situation during sex. Because he literally, got off on it.

I thought he told me this to be edgy, the way men often do. But it made me uncomfortable and I didn’t know how to respond. We hung up moments later and I felt confused but we’d already made the plans to hang out.

When we hung out I asked him about Ana and chaeiry, He’d repeated the usual, “they’re psycho, I love toxic women. It’s exciting, it’s good content” I think I scoffed. He tells me Ana was a stalker but he’s over it, again because he’s a sociopath and he doesn’t care much.

That’s the thing, Steven is so charming he could be saying literally anything and you feel like you’re in on it. I thought, yea. She is psycho. I’m different.

He frequently repeated “we’ll see how you’ll turn out” like he either expected me to be psychotic, he was hoping I’d be, or I’d have to prove myself that I wasn’t. I chose the last one.

Didn’t pan out, I guess. Not the way he sees it.

I didn’t know they’d been sexting. If I’d have known, I wouldnt have continued to hang out with him. Because that’s abusive. And I don’t have sexual relationships with abusive men.

Fast forward. I reach out to Ana almost a week ago. I’m feeling low because dgg hates me, and they’re following me across platforms to leave nasty comments. And I’m starting to feel weird that Steven gaslit me and uploaded the video of me crying on his YouTube.

And she very willingly tells me, they still have a sexual relationship.

That’s when I decided I’d never stream with him again.

Ana tells me he told her he likes to watch me embarrass myself on stream. I remember the ex wife story, the big secret. I remember the way I found out who he was, through the Ana streams being recommended to me on YouTube, He does , he likes this.

And it’s when I went on stream to say he was borderline abusive (I didn’t have the balls or the words to say it with my full chest) and I thought the power dynamic and lack of care he had for my well-being was uncomfortable enough to not stream with him anymore. (Something I thought would be a relief to his community and neutral to Steven) I immediately, was met with disdain. People jumping down my throat telling me I was horrible for coming out about it, very few people questioning why I’d said it. Or thinking critically about the power structure I felt I’d been in, where he used his orbiters as content, teeing us up for vitriol and not controlling the narrative he could’ve easily controlled, or at the very least told his community to stop mass linking pictures of me without makeup.

I’d gone from 80 views to 1600 on my stream. But I’d stopped talking about it at 400. I didn’t know the can of worms i was opening. I didn’t understand the culture of dgg, I thought I’d had an idea, but this was….big.

Then Steven went on stream and called max a rapist. And hurled that he was the most manipulative person he’d ever met, and I was just his next victim.

Max comes on to assert he wasn’t going behind stevens back as a backstab, but because Ana had told him they were still sexting, it was abusive, and he wanted to know what else Steven has been doing. Because max also knows about stevens “secret”, because max has heard what everyone has heard about Steven being notorious, he’s experienced his own emotional detachment and abuse from Steven, and he wants to make sure a man he called his friend is not serially abusing women. He uses the public information, that Ana came forward about a week earlier on her stream (that they are still sexting and sexual) and reminds Steven why he’s questioning women.

Ana, who had spent days detailing carefully stevens abuse of her, too scared to leave his side. She does a 180, and lies about max manipulating her into giving her story to absolve her of any wrongdoing. She gets to be a victim. I was on that call. She never said no. She had spent hours prior giving her consent, readings out text messages. She was excited to come forward with this information because she finally thought she had a team assembled who cared about her. But the reception was bad. And she froze, and she went back to what she knew. Steven.

So she gets to be a victim. She says max manipulated her and Steven welcomes her with open arms because now,

Max is the enemy. Max is the evil.

I’ll be honest. I wanted that out.

I wanted it so bad. Id already spent hours getting harassed by dgg, seeing what the subreddit was saying. I was useless, evil, disgusting. This hit my mom-wound. I am so scared of being these things. I wanted to take solace in the out Steven gave me. I wanted to be a victim of max so bad. I wanted to avoid the dogpile and go back to my epic highs and lows of debating on stevens channel. The attention, the lights, the in-group. I wanted it.

I wanted to curl up next to Steven and repeat how bad max was. I wanted safety from the avalanche that would inevitably come.

But I knew I couldn’t.

Because I knew he abused Ana, I knew he lied to his wife. And I’m a feminist. It’s what I built my platform on. I don’t associate with abusive men. I won’t keep their secrets.

At this point I didn’t think Steven was REALLY a sociopath. I didn’t think he was doing it on purpose, how could I? Steven HAD been kind to me. He’s a charming, likable guy. I messaged him saying I thought he needed to get help. See a therapist, maybe it was sex addiction, maybe he was stuck in his relationship, maybe it was intrapersonal.

I called him after his “I’m nuclear” stream.

And he gaslit me for 2 hours straight.

Assured he checked on me, did everything he could to be a good friend. Assured me he was an incredible friend, he’d checked on me once. I said I was okay…so really It was actually my fault . I’d been manipulating him….because I told him I was okay to get back on stream. Of course I did. Who wouldn’t? I’d sobbed on that stream, made a diary entry. He’d acknowledged I wasn’t fit for stream. Yet, he’d say a day later my spiral was good content. Everyone has a piece of responsibility pie.

he repeated I didn’t deserve his charitably, he was just so charitable and such a good friend, I was crazy. But I didn’t have to be. And I still had a chance to be in his good graces if I denounced max. He said I needed help. That if I just woke up I’d see everything max was saying was a lie. And I nodded and stopped at the thought. The golden out. My solace.

And lastly he’d brought up the secret I’d told him.

Out of nowhere. So out of place in the conversation.

The secret I’d told him when he told me his secret. Told me it would ruin me, how bad I’d look. He’d worked it in. I’m not going to be blackmailed.

Hasan piker slept with my very young friend when he was not so young. It was legal. But he’s denounced men publically for doing much less. I don’t care about it. And she’s never going to come forward, but the fact exists nonetheless. An example of hipocrisy. Another persons Hipocrisy is gold to a streamer. A shiny weapon. I was armed. Nothing will come of it. Ethically it is a small infranction. And it won’t be held over my head.

I’d tried to get max and Steven to talk in the call. Max begrudgingly came. Steven refused to say anything. Called him a rapist again, and max left with his integrity, having done me the favor of joining the call because he could see I was desperately trying to fix the mess. And Steven had typed “she’s self harming, help come quick” and so max has come, quickly to see if it were true. Steven just laughed at how stupid it was for max to care if I was cutting myself on this VC call.

Unbeknownst to me while on the call he’d been writing to dgg “I’m saving the lav bridge”

he tells me out loud “I can’t believe I’m having a 40k viewer conversation offline”. I try to chuckle at the comment. Then I redirect-

and then assures dgg, again, unbeknownst to me “maybe I can get her on tomorrow”. I’d just told him the chances of me coming on in the next months were zero, but maybe after, one on one. I’d just said this. He knew I wasn’t coming on, and he hadn’t discussed with me that he was relaying this information to dgg.

But he only exists on these streams. His community is him. He doesn’t want to have the conversation anymore, he’s checked out. He’s tried to convince me max is manipulating me and he thinks it’s worked. We hang up.

I woke up the next morning to see Ana had taken the “out”. It was the safer option. But it had made me so angry. I’d started to believe Steven was the good guy, because how couldn’t he have been? He’d platformed me, so new to the game, I didn’t deserve it. he’d met up with me, and was…sweet albeit a bit detached…

but max was a good guy. And I could swear he wasn’t manipulating me. And Ana had spun this web out of control.

I was so, so, so angry at Ana. I thought she’d sold me something. Steven re-assured me she was crazy and looping the night before. And he forgave her, and he could forgive me too if I just….denounced max.

Max assures me this is exactly how an abused woman acts. I google it because I don’t trust him. (4000 people are telling me I’m a pawn in max’s game. I am skeptical of max)

I should not have publically trashed her, and I should not have gone in that panel in the emotional state I was in.

I went on chuds panel after being gaslit by Steven.

Again, I shouldn’t have. Because I did not have it correct. I hadn’t spoken to my therapist in a week, I’m getting mounds and mounds of shit and hate pummeled at me. I just wanted to make it better. I just wanted everyone to be better. I couldn’t believe Ana had lied. After all the ways she called Steven evil I couldn’t believe she’d re-pledge allegiance. I wanted to make everything better.

I got off chuds stream after a desperate plea to the audience to leave my loved ones alone. (It only emboldened them) and watch stevens stream to self harm.

I’m watching Kyla literally do whatever she can to gain favor in the same way I was incentivized to , on stream.

I’ve known the feeling of in group signaling. I’ve known my place in this machine. I’ve been Kyla.

There is a weak orbiter, you need to solidify your place.

I did this with max.

Remind the audience you’re there. And you’re good. And you’re here to stay.

Steven is still, blazeé.

Steven sits there watching me on chud logics panel and calmly chuckles at my tears and sobs. He chuckles. He laughs. Despite the conversation we’d had the night before. He enjoys the content I create. He enjoys my implosion. Womens ults, make for great media.

He drags me through the mud.

My stocks, burned to the ground

My stocks are gone.

My worth, my wealth. Decimated. I am unworthy of human-Ness

Kyla speaks.

She is better than me. She is smarter, she is more put together, she is wiser and older, and best of all the audience loves her. I’ve been constantly reminded. Even by her, a multitude of times.

And she goes off on a tangent, and Steven is not even listening. She may realize this is happening.

He moves the conversation without giving her the validation she needs.

She stays silent until it’s her turn to perform again.

Aba comes on

He’s right, victory lap. He was right all along.

He says “I get to shine”.

And he does, so bright.

And it burns

Kyla has to take her stage again, she wants to share the stage. She wants to shine. She wants to share.

Kyla says Steven is simply too likable, that is his problem. His response

“Cringe”

Steven is the victim.

I’m reminded of how small and silly this world is.

this very small place, Steven can control. It’s his. He calls himself a sociopath 4 times; and his orbiters jump to empathy.

No you’re not a sociopath. You’re just hurt. You’re just so…hurt. Please, just admit you actually are upset by this, I’m so sorry this happened to you, again. You can’t trust anyone. You’re too forgiving.

He makes excuses for max. Now. He shmoozes. He masturbates to his audience. He gets to have empathy for max. He is the victor, he is the guy.

He is god!

Max is Judas.

But Steven has empathy for Judas.

He ejactulates his empathy into the audience.

Aba asks Steven , almost on the money, SO CLOSE, he asks why uses us as entertainment. But somehow, it’s not stevens fault. Not his responsibility. It can’t be. It is maxs. It is mine. Aba says it’s max and I’s fault. We are bad people. We are bad people for wanting to use the big opportunity we’ve been given by a big streamer with no boundaries, Steven is just too good.

And I can not speak. I won’t. I am already burned. Already scalded. Nothing I say is correct, I live in delusion. My narrative is up in the air. I can say nothing. I watch horrified.

Stevens reminds Kyla he is a sociopath, and she does not believe him. And he even calls her kyra. The wrong name.

Steven explains to Kyla how he uses us for content.

And Kyla does not listen to him tell her who he is

He is telling her who he is,

And she does not hear him

He said it again, he is a sociopath, he doesn’t care about this

She does not believe him.

I wonder what would happen if a friend were to ask him what he’d done wrong

He calls max a narcissist. For a year he’s groaned about armchair psychiatry and peer diagnosis. It doesn’t pertain. Not to max. Steven KNOWS what max is.

Kyla scrambles to tell Steven he’s a good person deep down and needs better friends and richness

And Steven

Calls her a “max”

A weapon.

He says she’s mind raping him. That he is just this person. He just doesn’t feel.

Kyla goes silent.

Shot dead with “max” bullets.

Max, who was one of his closest friends, a week before.

He promises for the 3rd day in a row to nuke all mention of me. He doesn’t. The engagement is too good. He doesn’t.

Kelly jean says she wound me up on purpose. She knew it’d be easy after I cried on stream. She knows I’m spiraling. She likes it because I exploded on her in a panel and I have differing views on sex work.

So I am no longer human.

She said she’d think it was fun. Kyla, the psychology buff, laughs. Steven laughs, Everyone laughs. Then is a half hearted sigh of disappointment and they move on

I message max, sobbing. He is his usual self. Caring, there when I need him but vaguely distant because he knows I don’t trust him, and he doesn’t want our narratives to get mixed up when we’re both emotional. He is hyper aware of the manipulative narcissist label that’s been hurled at him. He wants to keep us both safe.

Shaelin asks if I’m eating

Max mostly just tells me to write how I feel.

I do. I write this. I look back up at stevens stream.

And last, Steven reads a text from Ana.

Ana laughs at me. She jokes about me and max. We are crazy. I am crazy.

but now

I am Ana.

And she laughs, and steven laughs.

And the stream chat roars with favor for her. I’m reminded of the text she sent Steven in those screenshots, “your community likes me now”

she is safe.

And the chat fills

“Ana stocks are up”.

I know Steven will see this, and continue the hurl. He’ll go over the poorly made hit piece, lying about every personal aspect of my life. The one made by a self proclaimed white supremesist, the one who said my heart condition is really just a meth overdose(lol). He’ll try to do everything he can to discredit me and max, he already called max a rapist. I wonder what he’ll call me. I won’t be listening to hear it. What’s he got to discredit? Ill fall into oblivion with my fiancé and cats. His platform will get bigger.

I’ve gone over every detail in that video. I’d never levied a false rape allegation. I’ve never had a gofundmescam. I go over this, I made a statement in my announcements on my discord. This is old, years old, fake news. But it’s shiny. It’s new. It fits the narrative that I’m evil. I get it, I watch those videos. They’re fun. I hope Steven enjoys it. I hope everyone here enjoys it.

ILL BE ON THIS PATREON THOUGH. . (Twitter probably needs to go, but I can not part with it

This world has taken up my life. To my detriment, I have worked hard.

I’m addicted to approval, I’m addicted to proving myself. All of this hurts me. I couldn’t stop. I have to stop.

I have dreams outside of the online that I need to pursue.

Overall, the narcissistic world of entertainment, has not bode me well. I left the music industry for the same reason. Something I thought was fun, turned into an ego feed, turned in to self harm, turned in to me spiraling. I don’t want to be famous. I don’t want these many eyes on me. It hurts. But It’s addicting. To someone like me, who grew up without parents, to have eyes on me, the potential for love, the potential to prove im worthy of attention and adoration and love……it’s heroin. But I can’t get that from you guys, ultimately. It’s fickle. I can only get that from me.

But without further ado, what you all came for.

I don’t care about the safety of keeping this inside my mouth and chest. Do your worst. I have nothing left to lose.

It sucks to come out. It does. It sucks to be a woman who comes out about someone bigger than you. This is my second time. Unfortunately men in power or with big platforms seem to have a propensity to abuse it.

This time is different. This time for a week straight, day and night I had hundreds of thousands of people trying to gaslight me or just downright hurling abuse at me.

Going public with sexual instances is embarrassing, and even more embarrassing when someone tries to come forward with that information for you.

People have decided to relay my personal story with Steven, that I told to a friend privately.

I should not trust friends online.

And I’m going to lay it out for you concisely…. and I’m never going to speak of it again. Steven and I did not have sex. We hooked up. I was nervous because I’d not been with many uncircumcised men. He was fine with that.

I went home after, I felt good about what had happened.

I did not open my relationship for Steven, I did not close it because of Steven.

What I didn’t anticipate was becoming part of stevens orbit in the way I had. I did not knowingly consent to a scenario Of being evaluated for my performance, being told I brought views and clicks and content, and existing in the social contract I did, after having a sexual dynamic with him, and I didn’t realize how many of the women in the orbit had the same social contract I did.

This was enough to just make me feel, strange.

Another thing that made me feel strange was when I begged Steven to do as little as tell him community to go easier on me on the platforms he could control. He deletes some of his fans critism of him on the Reddit, I thought it would be easy. Apparently, it wasn’t. And I was publically embarrassed for weeks, being gaslit that I couldn’t take accountability for how dumb and irritating and annoying I was, and I just had to admit all of those things and then we’d reevaluate. Steven even said I was using DARVO abuse tactics when I was expressing my feelings.

The thing that made me feel the weirdest was finding out Steven was sexting and still seeking sex from Ana, who for years he publically embarrassed and acknowledged was not only “crazy” but also completely obsessed with him and the consensus in the community has been she’s a psycho stalker and stevens done little to nothing to quell that idea and exploit Ana’s sobs and mental breakdown for views.

This, is abusive. It was the cherry on top that nobody knew about it, and the nuts sprinkled over everything was that Ana told me she felt like she had to do it in order to feel safe from Steven.

this resonated.

The first time Steven and I spoke off stream, he decided to tell me this huge “career ending”\*secret, and I bartered with my own secret. He’d alluded to it in messages, baiting me. And I had to know. We were strangers, and he told me.

\*there’s nothing career ending about this secret. Not for him: it’s why he so often teases it. He wears it like a badge of honor. He smiles every time he brings it up on stream. He laughed while telling me.

I’m not keeping an abusers secrets. I’m done.

It was about sexual indiscretions about someone other than his wife. An affair, his wife didn’t know the extent of. And he said he was never going to tell her. He didn’t want to ruin anything because he had jumped the gun and broken up with Melina before he knew this other woman had wanted him. She didn’t, and he went back. I thought, okay this is not really my business and I don’t know Melina.

Steven says he doesn’t care if this gets out because it only hurts the other woman. He’s said this on stream multiple times. So, alas. I’m not going to mention the other woman because this has nothing to do with her.

And here I am, a stranger, holding this secret. Me, a stranger, pleading with him to tell his wife about his misconduct. I say secrets hurt people, resentment builds, he assures he’s fine and will probably never tell her. I ask if this is going to affect him, he repeats for the 70th time to me, he is a sociopath and he doesn’t and won’t care.

Make no mistake. He wants people to know this secret. He wants to embarrass Melina and the other woman involved. It’s why he teases it on stream. It’s why he tells every orbiter , it why he told me. A stranger he wanted to have sex with. People with secrets they don’t want people to know do not tease it on a stream with 15k people.

A day or two before meeting in person we spoke on the phone again, and I had asked him about his relationship history because it seemed very toxic to me, being that he was cheating on his wife and the only other public relationships I knew of, online, were toxic. And he told me this really fun story of this time he and his ex worked together and he was sleeping with another co-worker. His ex went to all of their boss to tell him Steven was sleeping with a coworker and he lied to his boss about it, denying it, saying she was a psycho and psychotic and she sobbed and freaked out in the office, and got fired. And he liked it. And they continued to have sex, and brought up the situation during sex. Because he literally, got off on it.

I thought he told me this to be edgy, the way men often do. But it made me uncomfortable and I didn’t know how to respond. We hung up moments later and I felt confused but we’d already made the plans to hang out.

When we hung out I asked him about Ana and chaeiry, He’d repeated the usual, “they’re psycho, I love toxic women. It’s exciting, it’s good content” I think I scoffed. He tells me Ana was a stalker but he’s over it, again because he’s a sociopath and he doesn’t care much.

That’s the thing, Steven is so charming he could be saying literally anything and you feel like you’re in on it. I thought, yea. She is psycho. I’m different.

He frequently repeated “we’ll see how you’ll turn out” like he either expected me to be psychotic, he was hoping I’d be, or I’d have to prove myself that I wasn’t. I chose the last one.

Didn’t pan out, I guess. Not the way he sees it.

I didn’t know they’d been sexting. If I’d have known, I wouldnt have continued to hang out with him. Because that’s abusive. And I don’t have sexual relationships with abusive men.

Fast forward. I reach out to Ana almost a week ago. I’m feeling low because dgg hates me, and they’re following me across platforms to leave nasty comments. And I’m starting to feel weird that Steven gaslit me and uploaded the video of me crying on his YouTube.

And she very willingly tells me, they still have a sexual relationship.

That’s when I decided I’d never stream with him again.

Ana tells me he told her he likes to watch me embarrass myself on stream. I remember the ex wife story, the big secret. I remember the way I found out who he was, through the Ana streams being recommended to me on YouTube, He does , he likes this.

And it’s when I went on stream to say he was borderline abusive (I didn’t have the balls or the words to say it with my full chest) and I thought the power dynamic and lack of care he had for my well-being was uncomfortable enough to not stream with him anymore. (Something I thought would be a relief to his community and neutral to Steven) I immediately, was met with disdain. People jumping down my throat telling me I was horrible for coming out about it, very few people questioning why I’d said it. Or thinking critically about the power structure I felt I’d been in, where he used his orbiters as content, teeing us up for vitriol and not controlling the narrative he could’ve easily controlled, or at the very least told his community to stop mass linking pictures of me without makeup.

I’d gone from 80 views to 1600 on my stream. But I’d stopped talking about it at 400. I didn’t know the can of worms i was opening. I didn’t understand the culture of dgg, I thought I’d had an idea, but this was….big.

Then Steven went on stream and called max a rapist. And hurled that he was the most manipulative person he’d ever met, and I was just his next victim.

Max comes on to assert he wasn’t going behind stevens back as a backstab, but because Ana had told him they were still sexting, it was abusive, and he wanted to know what else Steven has been doing. Because max also knows about stevens “secret”, because max has heard what everyone has heard about Steven being notorious, he’s experienced his own emotional detachment and abuse from Steven, and he wants to make sure a man he called his friend is not serially abusing women. He uses the public information, that Ana came forward about a week earlier on her stream (that they are still sexting and sexual) and reminds Steven why he’s questioning women.

Ana, who had spent days detailing carefully stevens abuse of her, too scared to leave his side. She does a 180, and lies about max manipulating her into giving her story to absolve her of any wrongdoing. She gets to be a victim. I was on that call. She never said no. She had spent hours prior giving her consent, readings out text messages. She was excited to come forward with this information because she finally thought she had a team assembled who cared about her. But the reception was bad. And she froze, and she went back to what she knew. Steven.

So she gets to be a victim. She says max manipulated her and Steven welcomes her with open arms because now,

Max is the enemy. Max is the evil.

I’ll be honest. I wanted that out.

I wanted it so bad. Id already spent hours getting harassed by dgg, seeing what the subreddit was saying. I was useless, evil, disgusting. This hit my mom-wound. I am so scared of being these things. I wanted to take solace in the out Steven gave me. I wanted to be a victim of max so bad. I wanted to avoid the dogpile and go back to my epic highs and lows of debating on stevens channel. The attention, the lights, the in-group. I wanted it.

I wanted to curl up next to Steven and repeat how bad max was. I wanted safety from the avalanche that would inevitably come.

But I knew I couldn’t.

Because I knew he abused Ana, I knew he lied to his wife. And I’m a feminist. It’s what I built my platform on. I don’t associate with abusive men. I won’t keep their secrets.

At this point I didn’t think Steven was REALLY a sociopath. I didn’t think he was doing it on purpose, how could I? Steven HAD been kind to me. He’s a charming, likable guy. I messaged him saying I thought he needed to get help. See a therapist, maybe it was sex addiction, maybe he was stuck in his relationship, maybe it was intrapersonal.

I called him after his “I’m nuclear” stream.

And he gaslit me for 2 hours straight.

Assured he checked on me, did everything he could to be a good friend. Assured me he was an incredible friend, he’d checked on me once. I said I was okay…so really It was actually my fault . I’d been manipulating him….because I told him I was okay to get back on stream. Of course I did. Who wouldn’t? I’d sobbed on that stream, made a diary entry. He’d acknowledged I wasn’t fit for stream. Yet, he’d say a day later my spiral was good content. Everyone has a piece of responsibility pie.

he repeated I didn’t deserve his charitably, he was just so charitable and such a good friend, I was crazy. But I didn’t have to be. And I still had a chance to be in his good graces if I denounced max. He said I needed help. That if I just woke up I’d see everything max was saying was a lie. And I nodded and stopped at the thought. The golden out. My solace.

And lastly he’d brought up the secret I’d told him.

Out of nowhere. So out of place in the conversation.

The secret I’d told him when he told me his secret. Told me it would ruin me, how bad I’d look. He’d worked it in. I’m not going to be blackmailed.

Hasan piker slept with my very young friend when he was not so young. It was legal. But he’s denounced men publically for doing much less. I don’t care about it. And she’s never going to come forward, but the fact exists nonetheless. An example of hipocrisy. Another persons Hipocrisy is gold to a streamer. A shiny weapon. I was armed. Nothing will come of it. Ethically it is a small infranction. And it won’t be held over my head.

I’d tried to get max and Steven to talk in the call. Max begrudgingly came. Steven refused to say anything. Called him a rapist again, and max left with his integrity, having done me the favor of joining the call because he could see I was desperately trying to fix the mess. And Steven had typed “she’s self harming, help come quick” and so max has come, quickly to see if it were true. Steven just laughed at how stupid it was for max to care if I was cutting myself on this VC call.

Unbeknownst to me while on the call he’d been writing to dgg “I’m saving the lav bridge”

he tells me out loud “I can’t believe I’m having a 40k viewer conversation offline”. I try to chuckle at the comment. Then I redirect-

and then assures dgg, again, unbeknownst to me “maybe I can get her on tomorrow”. I’d just told him the chances of me coming on in the next months were zero, but maybe after, one on one. I’d just said this. He knew I wasn’t coming on, and he hadn’t discussed with me that he was relaying this information to dgg.

But he only exists on these streams. His community is him. He doesn’t want to have the conversation anymore, he’s checked out. He’s tried to convince me max is manipulating me and he thinks it’s worked. We hang up.

I woke up the next morning to see Ana had taken the “out”. It was the safer option. But it had made me so angry. I’d started to believe Steven was the good guy, because how couldn’t he have been? He’d platformed me, so new to the game, I didn’t deserve it. he’d met up with me, and was…sweet albeit a bit detached…

but max was a good guy. And I could swear he wasn’t manipulating me. And Ana had spun this web out of control.

I was so, so, so angry at Ana. I thought she’d sold me something. Steven re-assured me she was crazy and looping the night before. And he forgave her, and he could forgive me too if I just….denounced max.

Max assures me this is exactly how an abused woman acts. I google it because I don’t trust him. (4000 people are telling me I’m a pawn in max’s game. I am skeptical of max)

I should not have publically trashed her, and I should not have gone in that panel in the emotional state I was in.

I went on chuds panel after being gaslit by Steven.

Again, I shouldn’t have. Because I did not have it correct. I hadn’t spoken to my therapist in a week, I’m getting mounds and mounds of shit and hate pummeled at me. I just wanted to make it better. I just wanted everyone to be better. I couldn’t believe Ana had lied. After all the ways she called Steven evil I couldn’t believe she’d re-pledge allegiance. I wanted to make everything better.

I got off chuds stream after a desperate plea to the audience to leave my loved ones alone. (It only emboldened them) and watch stevens stream to self harm.

I’m watching Kyla literally do whatever she can to gain favor in the same way I was incentivized to , on stream.

I’ve known the feeling of in group signaling. I’ve known my place in this machine. I’ve been Kyla.

There is a weak orbiter, you need to solidify your place.

I did this with max.

Remind the audience you’re there. And you’re good. And you’re here to stay.

Steven is still, blazeé.

Steven sits there watching me on chud logics panel and calmly chuckles at my tears and sobs. He chuckles. He laughs. Despite the conversation we’d had the night before. He enjoys the content I create. He enjoys my implosion. Womens ults, make for great media.

He drags me through the mud.

My stocks, burned to the ground

My stocks are gone.

My worth, my wealth. Decimated. I am unworthy of human-Ness

Kyla speaks.

She is better than me. She is smarter, she is more put together, she is wiser and older, and best of all the audience loves her. I’ve been constantly reminded. Even by her, a multitude of times.

And she goes off on a tangent, and Steven is not even listening. She may realize this is happening.

He moves the conversation without giving her the validation she needs.

She stays silent until it’s her turn to perform again.

Aba comes on

He’s right, victory lap. He was right all along.

He says “I get to shine”.

And he does, so bright.

And it burns

Kyla has to take her stage again, she wants to share the stage. She wants to shine. She wants to share.

Kyla says Steven is simply too likable, that is his problem. His response

“Cringe”

Steven is the victim.

I’m reminded of how small and silly this world is.

this very small place, Steven can control. It’s his. He calls himself a sociopath 4 times; and his orbiters jump to empathy.

No you’re not a sociopath. You’re just hurt. You’re just so…hurt. Please, just admit you actually are upset by this, I’m so sorry this happened to you, again. You can’t trust anyone. You’re too forgiving.

He makes excuses for max. Now. He shmoozes. He masturbates to his audience. He gets to have empathy for max. He is the victor, he is the guy.

He is god!

Max is Judas.

But Steven has empathy for Judas.

He ejactulates his empathy into the audience.

Aba asks Steven , almost on the money, SO CLOSE, he asks why uses us as entertainment. But somehow, it’s not stevens fault. Not his responsibility. It can’t be. It is maxs. It is mine. Aba says it’s max and I’s fault. We are bad people. We are bad people for wanting to use the big opportunity we’ve been given by a big streamer with no boundaries, Steven is just too good.

And I can not speak. I won’t. I am already burned. Already scalded. Nothing I say is correct, I live in delusion. My narrative is up in the air. I can say nothing. I watch horrified.

Stevens reminds Kyla he is a sociopath, and she does not believe him. And he even calls her kyra. The wrong name.

Steven explains to Kyla how he uses us for content.

And Kyla does not listen to him tell her who he is

He is telling her who he is,

And she does not hear him

He said it again, he is a sociopath, he doesn’t care about this

She does not believe him.

I wonder what would happen if a friend were to ask him what he’d done wrong

He calls max a narcissist. For a year he’s groaned about armchair psychiatry and peer diagnosis. It doesn’t pertain. Not to max. Steven KNOWS what max is.

Kyla scrambles to tell Steven he’s a good person deep down and needs better friends and richness

And Steven

Calls her a “max”

A weapon.

He says she’s mind raping him. That he is just this person. He just doesn’t feel.

Kyla goes silent.

Shot dead with “max” bullets.

Max, who was one of his closest friends, a week before.

He promises for the 3rd day in a row to nuke all mention of me. He doesn’t. The engagement is too good. He doesn’t.

Kelly jean says she wound me up on purpose. She knew it’d be easy after I cried on stream. She knows I’m spiraling. She likes it because I exploded on her in a panel and I have differing views on sex work.

So I am no longer human.

She said she’d think it was fun. Kyla, the psychology buff, laughs. Steven laughs, Everyone laughs. Then is a half hearted sigh of disappointment and they move on

I message max, sobbing. He is his usual self. Caring, there when I need him but vaguely distant because he knows I don’t trust him, and he doesn’t want our narratives to get mixed up when we’re both emotional. He is hyper aware of the manipulative narcissist label that’s been hurled at him. He wants to keep us both safe.

Shaelin asks if I’m eating

Max mostly just tells me to write how I feel.

I do. I write this. I look back up at stevens stream.

And last, Steven reads a text from Ana.

Ana laughs at me. She jokes about me and max. We are crazy. I am crazy.

but now

I am Ana.

And she laughs, and steven laughs.

And the stream chat roars with favor for her. I’m reminded of the text she sent Steven in those screenshots, “your community likes me now”

she is safe.

And the chat fills

“Ana stocks are up”.

I know Steven will see this, and continue the hurl. He’ll go over the poorly made hit piece, lying about every personal aspect of my life. The one made by a self proclaimed white supremesist, the one who said my heart condition is really just a meth overdose(lol). He’ll try to do everything he can to discredit me and max, he already called max a rapist. I wonder what he’ll call me. I won’t be listening to hear it. What’s he got to discredit? Ill fall into oblivion with my fiancé and cats. His platform will get bigger.

I’ve gone over every detail in that video. I’d never levied a false rape allegation. I’ve never had a gofundmescam. I go over this, I made a statement in my announcements on my discord. This is old, years old, fake news. But it’s shiny. It’s new. It fits the narrative that I’m evil. I get it, I watch those videos. They’re fun. I hope Steven enjoys it. I hope everyone here enjoys it.

But I am free. The cycle continues, but I am not in it."

129,Destiny,"Background: *I have a Master’s Degree in International Relations + I am Ukrainian (also 6’3”, 210 lbs, 8.5”). I am working on a much longer effortpost on this topic, but since Dylan brought it up last night, I will publish this* ***very simplified version*** *to pregame the audience for (what I assume) Dylan’s argument will be in regards to why Ukraine should be receiving more aid. I also welcome any and all feedback!*

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Limiting categories of conventional weapons available to Ukraine is illogical and/or cowardly. The US should lift the restrictions currently in place and provide Ukraine with the systems they have been requesting in order to end the conflict quicker and limit the damage it does to Ukraine and the world as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS:** For the purposes of this post, I take the default IR assumption of **“States will use nuclear weapons when faced with an imminent existential threat”.** I also assume that **any use of a nuclear weapon by Russia would trigger a direct NATO military intervention.** Finally, I assume that **any nuclear exchange is tantamount to MAD**.  I personally have objections to every one of these assumptions, and will dispute them in the longer version of the post, but they work fine for the argument I’m making here + these also seem to roughly be the assumptions that Destiny is operating from.

Note: The West/NATO/the US may be used interchangeably throughout this post, as it appears the US is the party that decides, or at least dictates the international aid policies for Ukraine. Also, this post will focus exclusively on **military aid**.

**THE CURRENT STRATEGY**: Prior to 2022, the West, led by the US, did not provide Ukraine with military aid in any significant quantities. After Russia launched a full-scale war against Ukraine on February 24th, this policy changed dramatically — Ukraine has now been provided with tens of billions $ in military aid, most notably including systems like the HIMARS MLRS and the wide variety of self-propelled artillery guns from different NATO states.

However, many categories of military aid seem to be **off-limits** for Ukraine. In the simplest terms, these include:

1. **Basically anything Western-made that has a big gun, except for artillery** — jets, attack helicopters, tanks, IFVs like the German-made Marder and the US-made Bradley, some types of APCs, large attack drones, etc.
2. **Ballistic Missiles of any range** — the most obvious example here are the ATACMS long-range missiles for the HIMARS system, which can reach as far as 300 km or 185 miles.
3. **Long-range Air Defense Systems** — this one is not a guarantee, but seeing how none of the systems provided thus far have been long-range, this is probably a fair assumption.
4. **Complete Jets from Non-Western Manufacturers** — information on the deliveries of non-Western Jets is scarce, but at the very least the US has shown itself to be afraid of delivering complete non-Western airframes on multiple occasions. ([1](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/ukraine-russia-poland-fighter-jets/index.html)) ([2](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/politics/ukraine-aircraft-spare-parts))
5. **Target Choice** — it would appear that the Ukrainians are [not allowed](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-hasnt-used-himars-strike-russian-territory-2022-07-08/) to **attack internationally recognized Russian territory** with at least some of the Western-made weapons. I suspect the West has some thoughts about Crimea as well, but we’ll find out when the Ukrainians get there.

Other restrictions may exist, but these are the most important ones that I’m aware of.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY THE CURRENT STRATEGY SUCKS**: It is really difficult to tell what the guiding principle behind the aforementioned categoric restrictions and the US military aid delivery process is in general. There have been hints about this from the Biden admin and other foreign leaders, but I think this recent [Obama quote](https://youtu.be/m_IOpjrd760?t=2050) on Pod Save America is probably the best summary of the mindset of American decision-makers:

“*We do have to be honest about what we can and cannot do. There are lines that we have to determine internally, that take into account* ***the risk of this tipping into a Russia - US/NATO conflict***\*. \[...\] Thinking about where\* ***defense stops and offense begins*** *and how we manage that is something that we have to pay attention to*.”

You have no idea how triggered I was when I first heard this. I could go on for days about how absolutely moronic this approach is, but I’ll try to summarize it laconically (keep in mind the **key assumptions**):

1. The idea that Ukraine could pose an **EXISTENTIAL** threat to Russia or that it has any desire to **take ACTUAL Russian territory** is **patently insane.** I can not believe that anyone seriously thinks this. If, somehow, this does come to pass and Zelenskyy transforms into Hitler upon sniffing an M1A2 Abrams, the US could simply **cut the aid** or even **aid Russia**, instead of sitting on our hands while hundreds of thousands of people die.
2. Assuming rationality, the risk of a Russia/NATO conflict beginning as a result of this is **ZERO**. If you’re getting **whooped** by an enemy that is supposed to be weaker than you, and you decide that your way to change this is to **open a second front against an enemy that is 100 TIMES STRONGER THAN YOU, you are patently insane.** If we **do not assume rationality**, then we are basically just f\*cked, and the only way out of **any** issue that may arise is to eliminate the irrational decision-makers.

Now, the more specific stuff:

3) **Who gives a f\*ck about who the manufacturer of a particular weapon is?** Why is it okay to give Ukraine [HUNDREDS of Soviet-made tanks](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2022/04/26/poland-confirms-t-72-tank-delivery-to-ukraine-with-challenger-2-tanks-to-fill-gap/), but a SINGLE Western-made tank would send Russia into a nuclear frenzy? This is basically Trump’s “Put Chinese flags on F-22s and bomb Russia” joke, except they think this way for real.

4) **Wtf is the rationale behind providing MASSIVE numbers of artillery, but no tanks, IFVs, etc?** At this point, HUNDREDS of NATO-built artillery pieces have been delivered. Western tanks, which are often built on the same chassis that the arty pieces are, are for whatever reason completely off-limits.

5) **Why should Russia be able to engage in essentially total war, while the country DEFENDING itself has to pull punches?** If you start a war, you obviously f\*cking consent to being struck back. Demanding that the Ukrainians refrain from destroying the missile systems that are blowing their cities to bits from Russian territory is ridiculous, and sets a precedent comparably harmful to the appeasement of nuclear blackmailers, which has been discussed extensively by Destiny.

6) **The jet thing. Holy f\*ck, it is so unbelievably idiotic.** Based on all of the evidence I’ve seen so far, it seems that the US isn’t okay with providing **complete Soviet-made airframes**, but is okay with delivering those SAME airframes in a **disassembled state**. I won’t even attempt to rationalize this.

There is a lot more, like the US government officials constantly [lying and stalling](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1585696565523513352?s=20&amp;t=L9b0_FzD1EqyzGWaSblhQw) in regards to the ATACMS missiles, the weirdly slow pace at which aid is actually being delivered, etc. Going into detail about EVERYTHING would take for too long, however, so I’ll wrap this section here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE CORRECT STRATEGY:** Make every conventional weapon that is available to NATO available for Ukraine as well. Unless NATO wishes to supply Ukraine with aircraft carriers, this wouldn’t even be **escalatory**, as Russia has already been using **all other types of conventional weapons** since Day 1 of the invasion. Furthermore, this would be in line with historical precedent — Russia did not feel the need to restrict itself in this manner for the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Syria, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**SOME COUNTERARGUMENTS (use strawman voice)**:

1. **What about the potential threat to Putin’s regime?** Does not matter. Threats to regime stability excuse neither conventional nor nuclear war. By this logic the US is entitled to attack Russia over Russiagate, and China is entitled to attack Taiwan as it delegitimizes the CCP’s autocratic style of governance by the simple fact of it being a liberal democracy. Enabling this would literally be WORSE than enabling the variation of nuclear blackmail that’s been discussed thus far.
2. **What about the logistics?** Logistics can be challenging, but using this as an argument against delivering certain categories of equipment is pure cope. Almost all Western weapons are also operated by dozens of countries across the globe. Furthermore, Ukraine itself has successfully integrated dozens if not hundreds of Western systems since the start of the war, and there hasn’t been a shred of evidence indicating that any of them have encountered insurmountable logistics challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

**P.S.:** More juicy effortposts coming soon. If one of the privileged DGGers would be kind enough to link this to Destiny, I’d greatly appreciate it — I have HUGE disagreements with him on the topic of Ukraine, and would like to debate him sometime if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Limiting categories of conventional weapons available to Ukraine is illogical and/or cowardly. The US should lift the restrictions currently in place and provide Ukraine with the systems they have been requesting in order to end the conflict quicker and limit the damage it does to Ukraine and the world as a whole.","Why Destiny is wrong and Biden's Ukraine policy actually SUCKS, aka The Nuclear War Manifesto v0.1",1668448057,"Why Destiny is wrong and Biden's Ukraine policy actually SUCKS, aka The Nuclear War Manifesto v0.1 Background: *I have a Master’s Degree in International Relations + I am Ukrainian (also 6’3”, 210 lbs, 8.5”).

**THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS:** For the purposes of this post, I take the default IR assumption of **“States will use nuclear weapons when faced with an imminent existential threat”.** I also assume that **any use of a nuclear weapon by Russia would trigger a direct NATO military intervention.** Finally, I assume that **any nuclear exchange is tantamount to MAD**.  I personally have objections to every one of these assumptions, and will dispute them in the longer version of the post, but they work fine for the argument I’m making here + these also seem to roughly be the assumptions that Destiny is operating from.

Note: The West/NATO/the US may be used interchangeably throughout this post, as it appears the US is the party that decides, or at least dictates the international aid policies for Ukraine. Also, this post will focus exclusively on **military aid**.

4) **Complete Jets from Non-Western Manufacturers** — information on the deliveries of non-Western Jets is scarce, but at the very least the US has shown itself to be afraid of delivering complete non-Western airframes on multiple occasions. ([1](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/ukraine-russia-poland-fighter-jets/index.html)) ([2](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/politics/ukraine-aircraft-spare-parts))

5) **Target Choice** — it would appear that the Ukrainians are [not allowed](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-hasnt-used-himars-strike-russian-territory-2022-07-08/) to **attack internationally recognized Russian territory** with at least some of the Western-made weapons. I suspect the West has some thoughts about Crimea as well, but we’ll find out when the Ukrainians get there.

Other restrictions may exist, but these are the most important ones that I’m aware of.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY THE CURRENT STRATEGY SUCKS**: It is really difficult to tell what the guiding principle behind the aforementioned categoric restrictions and the US military aid delivery process is in general. There have been hints about this from the Biden admin and other foreign leaders, but I think this recent [Obama quote](https://youtu.be/m_IOpjrd760?t=2050) on Pod Save America is probably the best summary of the mindset of American decision-makers: 

“*We do have to be honest about what we can and cannot do. There are lines that we have to determine internally, that take into account* ***the risk of this tipping into a Russia - US/NATO conflict****. \[...\] Thinking about where* ***defense stops and offense begins*** *and how we manage that is something that we have to pay attention to*.”

You have no idea how triggered I was when I first heard this. I could go on for days about how absolutely moronic this approach is, but I’ll try to summarize it laconically (keep in mind the **key assumptions**):

1) The idea that Ukraine could pose an **EXISTENTIAL** threat to Russia or that it has any desire to **take ACTUAL Russian territory** is **patently insane.** I can not believe that anyone seriously thinks this. If, somehow, this does come to pass and Zelenskyy transforms into Hitler upon sniffing an M1A2 Abrams, the US could simply **cut the aid** or even **aid Russia**, instead of sitting on our hands while hundreds of thousands of people die. 

2) Assuming rationality, the risk of a Russia/NATO conflict beginning as a result of this is **ZERO**. If you’re getting **whooped** by an enemy that is supposed to be weaker than you, and you decide that your way to change this is to **open a second front against an enemy that is 100 TIMES STRONGER THAN YOU, you are patently insane.** If we **do not assume rationality**, then we are basically just f\*cked, and the only way out of **any** issue that may arise is to eliminate the irrational decision-makers.

Now, the more specific stuff:

3) **Who gives a f\*ck about who the manufacturer of a particular weapon is?** Why is it okay to give Ukraine [HUNDREDS of Soviet-made tanks](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2022/04/26/poland-confirms-t-72-tank-delivery-to-ukraine-with-challenger-2-tanks-to-fill-gap/), but a SINGLE Western-made tank would send Russia into a nuclear frenzy? This is basically Trump’s “Put Chinese flags on F-22s and bomb Russia” joke, except they think this way for real.

4) **Wtf is the rationale behind providing MASSIVE numbers of artillery, but no tanks, IFVs, etc?** At this point, HUNDREDS of NATO-built artillery pieces have been delivered. Western tanks, which are often built on the same chassis that the arty pieces are, are for whatever reason completely off-limits.

5) **Why should Russia be able to engage in essentially total war, while the country DEFENDING itself has to pull punches?** If you start a war, you obviously f\*cking consent to being struck back. Demanding that the Ukrainians refrain from destroying the missile systems that are blowing their cities to bits from Russian territory is ridiculous, and sets a precedent comparably harmful to the appeasement of nuclear blackmailers, which has been discussed extensively by Destiny.

6) **The jet thing. Holy f\*ck, it is so unbelievably idiotic.** Based on all of the evidence I’ve seen so far, it seems that the US isn’t okay with providing **complete Soviet-made airframes**, but is okay with delivering those SAME airframes in a **disassembled state**. I won’t even attempt to rationalize this.

There is a lot more, like the US government officials constantly [lying and stalling](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1585696565523513352?s=20&amp;t=L9b0_FzD1EqyzGWaSblhQw) in regards to the ATACMS missiles, the weirdly slow pace at which aid is actually being delivered, etc. Going into detail about EVERYTHING would take for too long, however, so I’ll wrap this section here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**THE CORRECT STRATEGY:** Make every conventional weapon that is available to NATO available for Ukraine as well. Unless NATO wishes to supply Ukraine with aircraft carriers, this wouldn’t even be **escalatory**, as Russia has already been using **all other types of conventional weapons** since Day 1 of the invasion. Furthermore, this would be in line with historical precedent — Russia did not feel the need to restrict itself in this manner for the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Syria, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**SOME COUNTERARGUMENTS (use strawman voice)**: 

1) **What about the potential threat to Putin’s regime?** Does not matter. Threats to regime stability excuse neither conventional nor nuclear war. By this logic the US is entitled to attack Russia over Russiagate, and China is entitled to attack Taiwan as it delegitimizes the CCP’s autocratic style of governance by the simple fact of it being a liberal democracy. Enabling this would literally be WORSE than enabling the variation of nuclear blackmail that’s been discussed thus far.

2) **What about the logistics?** Logistics can be challenging, but using this as an argument against delivering certain categories of equipment is pure cope. Almost all Western weapons are also operated by dozens of countries across the globe. Furthermore, Ukraine itself has successfully integrated dozens if not hundreds of Western systems since the start of the war, and there hasn’t been a shred of evidence indicating that any of them have encountered insurmountable logistics challenges. 

&amp;#x200B;

**P.S.:** More juicy effortposts coming soon. If one of the privileged DGGers would be kind enough to link this to Destiny, I’d greatly appreciate it — I have HUGE disagreements with him on the topic of Ukraine, and would like to debate him sometime if possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Limiting categories of conventional weapons available to Ukraine is illogical and/or cowardly. The US should lift the restrictions currently in place and provide Ukraine with the systems they have been requesting in order to end the conflict quicker and limit the damage it does to Ukraine and the world as a whole."

However, not because of the clip they played on the podcast. but because of the rest of the speech that clearly contradicts itself.

The clip they played on Lex's podcast had this segment:

*Now, I want to be very clear — (applause) — very clear up front: Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.*  
*I know because I’ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.*

*But there is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.*

However, later on in the speech Biden defines ""MAGA republicans"" as the following:

*MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards — backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.*

Almost all republicans are pro-life, and almost all the christian ones would prefer some kind of civil union system rather than religious marriage for gay couples. This definition clearly alienates almost all of the republicans in the USA.

Depending on JBP neuroticism level on the day, I think it would be a way more interesting talk, JBP is someone who can analyze and extrapolate a statement to the n'th degree, and it would be an interesting dynamic seeing his abstraction capabilities paired with Destiny's ""autistic"" abilities to home in on a specific point. 

What would you guys prefer?

From redacteds patreon post and what we heard from Melina yesterday and before during her streams. Destiny feels like if Melina does not like how he acts she should just leave, as he would be perfectly fine to trade Melina for his current lifestyle, to expect him to hold back either from working to much or contact crazies is way to big of an ask even if its just to cut back a little bit.

In Destiny's defence as he mentioned yesterday when they first met Melina was way more poly than she seems to be now, which he said is fair people change over time. But i think he has changed as well as that time has passed, i think his addiction to crazy people has massively increased since he and Melina got together, and as Melina said yesterday she did not expect the amount of crazy that has come. i dont remember the amount of crazy when he and Eris or Bella were together but tbf they were not open.

This also may be speculation on my part but it seems from an outside view his respect of Melina's has dropped over time as well, where before he would try to compromise, it seems now he does some time whatever he wants regardless of what she thinks.

Hopefully Melina can figure out what she's willing to tolerate or come to terms with in the relationship,.Destiny's views are quite clear and i dont think he will change, so it remains to see what she will do.",I do feel bad for Melina,1668439140,"I do feel bad for Melina It seems like Destiny either has no self control when it comes to *Interesting* people or worse does not respect his partner's wishes when it comes to who he sleeps/contacts/flirts with.

170,Destiny,"TL;DR I disagree with the ban policy of this subreddit so if this post is no longer acceptable I accept my ban and leave willingly

I've lurked this sub for a couple years, even posted a couple times but my anxiety always got the better of me and I delete (you'll just have to take my word for it haha). But this is the first time I've been scared to post for fear of getting banned. 

Firstly I'm no fan of Redacted,  I thought his hitpiece on Dr K was transparent clout farming and hated the dude ever since. But I did think his criticism of this sub was fair. How did the community of a streamer known for debating anyone so easily justify banning all major disagreement.

 I'm no free speech absolutionist, arguing that speech can never cause enough harm to justify just silencing them is a losing one, but I think there should be better justification for a ban than 'this person has clearly not put enough thougt or effort into this post'
or however it's phrased. Does anyone really think they are capable of determining who has properly thought out ideas and who hasn't, especially on posts about themselves or people that they really like (or genuinely obsessed with in some cases).

What has this done? It's lead to new levels of toxicity, just look at the comments under anything related to the Redacted folk. Again I don't even agree with them but some of you guys show such an extreme level of hate it's making me feel guilty. This is entirely to do with the moderation policy of this subreddit (and other Destiny related forums). You've lost any ability to empathize with those you disagree with. You're ability to tolerate or entertain incorrect opinions (subjective of course) has atrophied, while you become increasingly defensive of the ones you do agree with. 

But most importantly it's lead to the acceptance of extreme actions on your side. As you hide from these stupid people whose opinions aren't even worth considering you continue to build up this image of a npc who will never understand. This leads to anger at the futility of trying to convince them. Then finally to outright hostility (I mean it's pointless arguing with them anyway) and the dropping of all attempts at good faith. Thus leading to a community that many, now including myself, see as toxic.

So then what's my alternative? Just let bad faith actors clog up this sub with the laziest, most headache inducing posts known to man? Obviously not, but I am arguing that we've gone too far in the other direction. But who the fuck am I to make that claim?

So I'll let you decide, if this isn't what this sub considers a quality post, ban me 
and I'll leave happy knowing at least I tried.

172,Destiny,"Okay, I don't want to psychoanalyze Steven, but I did notice this pattern.   


Generally, Joe Rogan can use cannabis in a way that keeps him productive and doesn't negatively affect his career, which he equates with 'responsible use'. I mean he does the 'Sober October', so he isn't addicted, right?   
I think Steven's view is the same - as long as he keeps bringing crazy people on and survives the shitstorm, he is fine. But arguably in both cases, there is a potential for abuse and things going sideways and taking that thing away can probably make your life better.  
However, I do think that the tradeoff for getting these positive things in their life doesn't seem worth it for both of them. And the only way they can see if it's worth it is to actually try completely dropping the thing they wanna keep, but I don't think they will ever do it.  


I just think that it's interesting to see how Destiny's defensiveness of his right to have the crazy in his life flares up. Like how he got pretty heated (my assumption, don't know his internal state) at Melina's argument about him having a big ego about it. But she was right - ego is about identity, and Destiny's identity of being this 'unemotional sociopath that is able to see everything in a very cold-blooded way' is super important for him and I doubt he will ever review his stance on that. Especially considering that yeah, his personality makes him super successful in the world of politics. There was even a [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2984999) that showed that 'dysfunctional/borderline psychopathic' people are overrepresented in the business world, compared to general society, although it showed that having such people in senior management usually reduces profits.

1. **Recent shifts in the market have greatly deminished consumer trust.**   
The ousting of two very polarizing cast members last week was generally well received by the markets. Dan and Aba stock most notably made huge gains in a very short amount of time. However what we see now is immense growth in a very uncertain envirement. i don't see other orbiter stocks rising to similar levels because consumer trust in the parasocial relationships with orbiters has been greatly decreased.   
In adition to that, revelations made by aforementioned former cast members put a shadow on the leadership of the company. In my view, the CEO has shown a lack of understanding for the concerns of his peers but also quite clearly has a problem with cheating. Even though this was expected, we have to remember this is the only reason why the open relationship architecture was chosen in the first place, to avoid this issue. But it seems like the CEO is unable or unwilling to legally and morally oblige to the contract he has signed here. 
2. **The companies intransparancy in regards to the situation at hand, and the recent revelations, have, in my opinion, made the scenario of a split likely.**  
We have seen a very rough patch in the relationship between CEO and his fiance earlier this year, and it seems, that we now know a little more about the background. What our market researchers see is clearly a pattern of behaviour that is at the very least mistrustful and at most deceiving. Those are big problems in any relationsship and giving that this is an open relationship it could in my view be detrimental. I think that the fiance has lost a good amount of trust in the CEO following recent revalations.
3. **""But the green card ohhn ooo""**  
Many market researchers argue that the relationship might end, but that in no way shape or form means that the two parties are going to get devorced since there is incentive from at least one party to keep up the legal mariage status. This is clearly a risk, however since the CEOs bridges tend to blow up in the most brutal way, i think this is highly unlikely. If something happens it will be big.
4. **STRATEGY:** This is a long play with a decent amount of risk, however with recent revelations its only a matter of time before the markets catch up with the news. So you could also swing trade. However i recommend holding. This is a great stock if you already have a portfolio full of dan and aba stock and want to hedge against another relationship. You could also either short melina stock in adition to buying this one or go long on melina then dump in a few months top. Overall i would recommend to keep your investment to safe options (Dan, Aba) and put a small amount in high risk/high reward plays like this.

227,Destiny,"Out of all the clips, Lex posted, [the one about Joe Rogan, his audience and vaccines went viral.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sjJTJdjBGw)

Partial breakdown of the \~first half of the clip

&gt;I think there are good conversations to be had about a lot of stuff related to how we handle the coronavirus you know were lockdowns effective was there enough data to support the huge measures we took um you know why didn't we have the option to show I was infected a month ago, why do I need to be vaccinated? why wasn't that option ever a thing in the United States I don't think it was.

This is a good way to come off as reasonable as a left leaning person, off the bat willing to analyze and criticize the effectiveness and the logic behind the measures that were implemented.

&gt;There are really good questions to be asked there. But all the people asking the questions are also trying to tell you that Ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies are the way to go for everything and the vaccine is evil and it's going to turn you gay like the frogs and it's like Jesus like you cant there's like no place to reasonably criticize from because all of the people that are criticizing aren't doing it with an open mind or you know they're not reading studies or do anything they're saying like ""I do my own research"" which means they listen to whatever the last guy Joe Rogan said and now they're parroting that opinion 100% -easy now -yeah not... well the last guy on Joe Rogan, not Joe Rogan ok? That Robert Malone guy on Joe Rogan got me real fired up. -That's one guest -People see him as like the father of mRNA technology he published one paper okay? -What do you mean people? which people think that? -Joe Rogan fans I get like... I run into these people. I start arguing with this people and they start sending me ""well, what about.."" -I'm a Joe Rogan fan and I appreciate the vaccine -That's good I'm glad you do, but there's definitely..

   All that preparing the field thrown in the wind. Destiny's making the point that the discourse is poisoned and there's no good place to have a nuanced conversation, which is a fair point, but then goes on to attack Joe Rogan's (a good friend of Lex) fanbase which completely derails the conversation. 

   He then mentions Robert Malone which he completely dismisses, which is an absolutely defensible take. Lex is still stuck on pushing back for Joe Rogan and his fanbase. He mentions that Robert Malone was ""one guest"", from his POV he knows pretty well Joe Rogan's controversy and what he went through and Rogan's more recent efforts in balancing out his guest spectrum of views. (one example off the top of my head I know he had 2 episodes on climate change a few months ago and the guests were diametrically opposed on the issue from one episode to the other and he spoke about his reasoning for this) 

While Lex is hooked on that, Destiny tries to move back the conversation towards ""the guest"" i.e. Robert Malone, attacking his credentials ""he published one paper okay?"". This could've been fine if they continued on this point and went in on Malone's credentials and credibility, but that didn't happen. Destiny should've took his time attacking Malone on this, not for Lex (he already said ""that's one guest"", signaling he has no intention on defending Malone's arguments), but for his audience. As it stands we're left with a snappy giggly short attack on Malone that won't get the chance to be elaborated further for the audience to understand.

&gt;\-Sorry, also but you said there's a type there's a type what's the type what's the type of Joe Rogan fan? -Anti-establishment. -I think that's not Joe Rogan that's a that's a general public discourse there's a default anti-establishment on the on the right and the left that's the default easy thing to go to.. -I think Joe Rogan fans are definitely a certain type of anti-establishment though like I could guess the Joe Rogan felt like if I were to do general population versus Joe Rogan fan who do you think is more likely to be anti-vaccine? -Do you have data on this are you just guessing? -Just guessing yeah -I think you are actually judging -I am -I think you're judging because I think you're also, the beautiful thing about podcasting this could be similar streaming is there's a large number of people that just listen, like what what does it mean to be a Joe Rogan fan -I don't think you just listen I think people listen and absorb the information -I would say that Joe Rogan fanbase is as divided in the vaccine as the general public -Gotcha man I'm gonna look for pulling data on that I'm sure somebody's got to have done it out there but.. -No but you're you're basically revealing the fact you have no data you're using your own judgment.. -For sure uh based on how he's had conversations about how his experience with the coronavirus and then based on the guests that have come on that have talked and echoed a lot of like anti-vaxx talking points and been completely unchallenged and then based on statements he's made about like myocarditis and the vaccine and everything as well yeah -So the.. it's the level of Challenge and not that he's doing -well yeah and then what his true positions are and then the types of guests he typically chooses to bring onto talk about the vaccines yeah -okay but that represents somehow a deep anti-establishment feeling versus just the vaccine I mean I've seen the vaccine and other things being a thing that broke people I think the whole of coronavirus that whole one or two years broke a lot of people -there's a lot of emotion and emotion quickly uh solidified into an opinion that almost had nothing to do with like re like thinking through and updating your knowledge and so on you just made up a.. made up your mind -yeah but I think a lot of it comes from that antisocial place like what the vaccine represents the ultimate of establishment it was a huge private company backed by a huge uh public government and there's Fauci and there's Biden and there's Pfizer and there's all these countries locking us up in our homes telling us to do a thing like the vaccine was like the ultimate like submission tool to like show you that the government owns you not only you have to get injected once it's a series and then you got to get boosters and it's like they're trying to keep you under their thumb and it's that's the control um I Feel Like That vaccine became like the ultimate rallying cry between like do you support are you a sellout that is going to believe whatever the government tells the Sheep to take or are you going to be like the guy that stands against the crowd and gets fired from his job and pulls his kids from school because they're not going to let the evil Fauci medicine you know jab them in the arm ...

Lex tries to elucidate why Destiny used Joe Rogan's fanbase as an example and what's the type of a Joe Rogan fan. Destiny concisely says anti-establishment, and Lex pushes back and thinks that's actually the default general discourse right now, on the right and on the left. Destiny also pushes back challenging Lex to acknowledge that a Joe Rogan fan is more likely to be anti-vaccine than someone from the general population. 

Lex asks for data (I think most people even in Lex's audience would agree to Destiny's point here, the caveat about ""a certain type of anti-establishment"" was very well done). Lex accuses Destiny of ""judging"". Destiny doesn't cower away from that. Lex doesn't explicitly say it, but he gives the impression that he's uncomfortable with Destiny using the typical Joe Rogan fan as a strawman/stereotype in his first original statement. 

Lex paints the picture of a diverse audience for Joe Rogan (""there's a large number of people that just listen"") which implies there's a vocal camp that seizes the discourse while others are less engaged in the public discourse while still being Joe Rogan fans. Destiny doesn't agree, because people listen and absorb, meaning even the less engaged fanbase views should be slanted by that fact. Lex Fridman takes a strong stand and states he believes the Joe Rogan fanbase is as divided on the vaccines as the general population. Destiny disagrees and wishes they could have polling data on that. (again, I think even Lex's audience would agree with Destiny here) 

When the disagreement is set, Lex enquires on Destiny's judgement that brought him to the conclusion, Destiny promptly responds on what he bases it on. They explore it further. 4 minutes in, the clip continues to other areas in the same topic.

The Joe Rogan forced detour and the unfinished Robert Malone take-down were the 2 big things that could've been avoided/handled better. At least that's my takeaway. Lex's a cool dude, it was a good episode. 

Very unfortunate the [defensive trigger](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxRc_uJ2gnzjYOheX44TOlbq2hhTI5o8au) happened so early in the topic. Lex was ok, but many in the audience probably remained with the trigger flipped on from then on.

Partial breakdown of the \~first half of the clip

&gt;I think there are good conversations to be had about a lot of stuff related to how we handle the coronavirus you know were lockdowns effective was there enough data to support the huge measures we took um you know why didn't we have the option to show I was infected a month ago, why do I need to be vaccinated? why wasn't that option ever a thing in the United States I don't think it was.

This is a good way to come off as reasonable as a left leaning person, off the bat willing to analyze and criticize the effectiveness and the logic behind the measures that were implemented.

&gt;There are really good questions to be asked there. But all the people asking the questions are also trying to tell you that Ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies are the way to go for everything and the vaccine is evil and it's going to turn you gay like the frogs and it's like Jesus like you cant there's like no place to reasonably criticize from because all of the people that are criticizing aren't doing it with an open mind or you know they're not reading studies or do anything they're saying like ""I do my own research"" which means they listen to whatever the last guy Joe Rogan said and now they're parroting that opinion 100% -easy now -yeah not... well the last guy on Joe Rogan, not Joe Rogan ok? That Robert Malone guy on Joe Rogan got me real fired up. -That's one guest -People see him as like the father of mRNA technology he published one paper okay? -What do you mean people? which people think that? -Joe Rogan fans I get like... I run into these people. I start arguing with this people and they start sending me ""well, what about.."" -I'm a Joe Rogan fan and I appreciate the vaccine -That's good I'm glad you do, but there's definitely..

   All that preparing the field thrown in the wind. Destiny's making the point that the discourse is poisoned and there's no good place to have a nuanced conversation, which is a fair point, but then goes on to attack Joe Rogan's (a good friend of Lex) fanbase which completely derails the conversation. 

   He then mentions Robert Malone which he completely dismisses, which is an absolutely defensible take. Lex is still stuck on pushing back for Joe Rogan and his fanbase. He mentions that Robert Malone was ""one guest"", from his POV he knows pretty well Joe Rogan's controversy and what he went through and Rogan's more recent efforts in balancing out his guest spectrum of views. (one example off the top of my head I know he had 2 episodes on climate change a few months ago and the guests were diametrically opposed on the issue from one episode to the other and he spoke about his reasoning for this) 

While Lex is hooked on that, Destiny tries to move back the conversation towards ""the guest"" i.e. Robert Malone, attacking his credentials ""he published one paper okay?"". This could've been fine if they continued on this point and went in on Malone's credentials and credibility, but that didn't happen. Destiny should've took his time attacking Malone on this, not for Lex (he already said ""that's one guest"", signaling he has no intention on defending Malone's arguments), but for his audience. As it stands we're left with a snappy giggly short attack on Malone that won't get the chance to be elaborated further for the audience to understand.

&gt;\-Sorry, also but you said there's a type there's a type what's the type what's the type of Joe Rogan fan? -Anti-establishment. -I think that's not Joe Rogan that's a that's a general public discourse there's a default anti-establishment on the on the right and the left that's the default easy thing to go to.. -I think Joe Rogan fans are definitely a certain type of anti-establishment though like I could guess the Joe Rogan felt like if I were to do general population versus Joe Rogan fan who do you think is more likely to be anti-vaccine? -Do you have data on this are you just guessing? -Just guessing yeah -I think you are actually judging -I am -I think you're judging because I think you're also, the beautiful thing about podcasting this could be similar streaming is there's a large number of people that just listen, like what what does it mean to be a Joe Rogan fan -I don't think you just listen I think people listen and absorb the information -I would say that Joe Rogan fanbase is as divided in the vaccine as the general public -Gotcha man I'm gonna look for pulling data on that I'm sure somebody's got to have done it out there but.. -No but you're you're basically revealing the fact you have no data you're using your own judgment.. -For sure uh based on how he's had conversations about how his experience with the coronavirus and then based on the guests that have come on that have talked and echoed a lot of like anti-vaxx talking points and been completely unchallenged and then based on statements he's made about like myocarditis and the vaccine and everything as well yeah -So the.. it's the level of Challenge and not that he's doing -well yeah and then what his true positions are and then the types of guests he typically chooses to bring onto talk about the vaccines yeah -okay but that represents somehow a deep anti-establishment feeling versus just the vaccine I mean I've seen the vaccine and other things being a thing that broke people I think the whole of coronavirus that whole one or two years broke a lot of people -there's a lot of emotion and emotion quickly uh solidified into an opinion that almost had nothing to do with like re like thinking through and updating your knowledge and so on you just made up a.. made up your mind -yeah but I think a lot of it comes from that antisocial place like what the vaccine represents the ultimate of establishment it was a huge private company backed by a huge uh public government and there's Fauci and there's Biden and there's Pfizer and there's all these countries locking us up in our homes telling us to do a thing like the vaccine was like the ultimate like submission tool to like show you that the government owns you not only you have to get injected once it's a series and then you got to get boosters and it's like they're trying to keep you under their thumb and it's that's the control um I Feel Like That vaccine became like the ultimate rallying cry between like do you support are you a sellout that is going to believe whatever the government tells the Sheep to take or are you going to be like the guy that stands against the crowd and gets fired from his job and pulls his kids from school because they're not going to let the evil Fauci medicine you know jab them in the arm ...

Lex tries to elucidate why Destiny used Joe Rogan's fanbase as an example and what's the type of a Joe Rogan fan. Destiny concisely says anti-establishment, and Lex pushes back and thinks that's actually the default general discourse right now, on the right and on the left. Destiny also pushes back challenging Lex to acknowledge that a Joe Rogan fan is more likely to be anti-vaccine than someone from the general population. 

Lex asks for data (I think most people even in Lex's audience would agree to Destiny's point here, the caveat about ""a certain type of anti-establishment"" was very well done). Lex accuses Destiny of ""judging"". Destiny doesn't cower away from that. Lex doesn't explicitly say it, but he gives the impression that he's uncomfortable with Destiny using the typical Joe Rogan fan as a strawman/stereotype in his first original statement. 

Lex paints the picture of a diverse audience for Joe Rogan (""there's a large number of people that just listen"") which implies there's a vocal camp that seizes the discourse while others are less engaged in the public discourse while still being Joe Rogan fans. Destiny doesn't agree, because people listen and absorb, meaning even the less engaged fanbase views should be slanted by that fact. Lex Fridman takes a strong stand and states he believes the Joe Rogan fanbase is as divided on the vaccines as the general population. Destiny disagrees and wishes they could have polling data on that. (again, I think even Lex's audience would agree with Destiny here) 

When the disagreement is set, Lex enquires on Destiny's judgement that brought him to the conclusion, Destiny promptly responds on what he bases it on. They explore it further. 4 minutes in, the clip continues to other areas in the same topic.

The Joe Rogan forced detour and the unfinished Robert Malone take-down were the 2 big things that could've been avoided/handled better. At least that's my takeaway. Lex's a cool dude, it was a good episode. 

Very unfortunate the [defensive trigger](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxRc_uJ2gnzjYOheX44TOlbq2hhTI5o8au) happened so early in the topic. Lex was ok, but many in the audience probably remained with the trigger flipped on from then on. 

Hope for a good showing in the discussion with Mikhaila Peterson also. That'll be interesting.

238,Destiny,"Sucks that this is a lot of people’s first impression of him. Just want to say that this is a freakin MAJOR celebration he got on the podcast. Talk about two worlds colliding. It’s one of the most validating, biggest wins, as Lex is one of the most cutting edge, unique platforms out there. I thought Destiny crushed 95% of it.

In the context of the whole interview, the statement made sense, but chopping it up makes Destiny flat footed. The viral clip makes him look kind of dumb because Destiny used a generalization with no backing evidence with regards to Joe Rogan listeners and their stance on the vaccine.

That said, I think Destiny has a pretty good finger on the pulse of opinion and think he’s actually right about his claim. The problem was he doesn’t have backup. Every single Joe Rogan fan I know now is anti-vax, pro ivermectin, but wasn’t initially where it is now. I think it was more split pre-Covid in terms of his demographic but the only Brogan fans I know now are what Destiny described. From real life experience of living in a Southern California desert town it being 65/35 cons vs. libs, all the cons I know worship Rogan as the truth and the libs don’t listen to him anymore.

260,Destiny,"I got high yesterday and went on a huge thought loop while listening to the podcast. Then I came home and wrote up a huge post trying to flesh out my ideas, but deleted it cause I figured it would get no traction.

After thinking about it a little more, here's my best summary. We are biologically and deterministically social animals. Anyone that is too anti-social will never have kids, and remove themselves from the gene pool. Part of that biological determinism is a theory of mind that ascribes our mindstate to others. The idea of social interaction is generally to increase some sense of camaraderie or communality. Through social interaction, we try to group ourselves with others who experience the same dopamine hits from the same stimuli.

The problem with otherizing language is that there is a reciprocity between people that makes some jokes okay. Steven talked about him making and receiving comments that never made him feel otherized, but the first time he heard a girl receiving the same handful of woman jokes from every lobby it triggered him. I think when we use some language it otherizes people because there is a distinct lack of reciprocity in the joke, and **that** is what otherizes people. Two people from any group can insult each other on in-group characteristics is because it is implicitly understood that either of them could be the target of the joke under the right conditions. The realization that both people can be targeted reinforces the amount of similarity between them. Because they can both empathize with being the target of the joke, they can calibrate how hurtful they're being.

Otherizing jokes lack that empathetic reciprocity. A joke about going back into the kitchen won't feel the same to a man or a woman given our cultural history. The woman can try to find an equivalent, but the fact that she'd have to put in effort in determining if it was just as hurtful/critical/funny/witty would reveal a real-world difference between the two that can't easily be bridged. Two people calling each other retards may be easy to do because both of them have a shared understanding, but that same joke can be otherizing to someone who is or knows someone that could be maliciously targeted and otherized by that word.

I'm not calling it a problem or suggesting we ban otherizing language. Lex had a feeling when Steven called people retarded and couldn't quite describe it or why it make him feel uneasy.

Now I realise Barbarians at the Wall by John Man is the outlier here, dating back to ancient times, but I really enjoyed his books on Saladin, Genghis &amp; Kublai Khan and Attila the Hun, so I figured I'd throw him in there

The more immigrants of a certain region/nationality in a given area the greater the chance of better restaurants catering both traditional and quality food from that region; that or a contemporary version catering to the local regions palate.

So obviously you get better Korean, Mexican, Cuban, Italian, Cajon, etc. in the US varying region to region than like Indonesian, southern Mediterranean, central to eastern European, etc. food. And so mark down food from regions that are unlikely to be good in the US precisely because of lack of exposure to authentic quality food from those other regions.

Side note: Cajon is fascinating as that's a mix of African, Spanish and French heritage.

It's hilarious that Destiny said he had a good English breakfast in London. Because its bloody obvious that it will be better in every way in the UK; let alone London which rivals the likes of New York, Paris etc. for high quality food scenes. 

You'll be able to find S tier food in any country, even 'street food', given the right location and local knowledge of what is good and not a tourist trap.

376,Destiny,"While \[REDACTED\] and 'dumbfuck' are both pointers to idiocy, the former is also very commonly used as a pointer to intellectual disability. While a lower intellect is a common negative trait of those with intellectual disabilities, using intellectual disability itself rather than its trait can be extremely 'otherizing', as Destiny puts it.

This 'otherizing' also fuels segregation in the minds of the individuals a part of the practicing communities.

A parallel can be drawn in calling someone 'poor' instead. If it were statistically deduced that poor people, perhaps as a result of a lack of access to proper education, displayed the same trait, it is clear to see how damaging common use of this word, used in this way, can be to a community.

But can 'dumbfuck' fit in this parallel? It can be argued that, as a class of peoples, dumbfucks do not choose to be so (anti-free will), and a lower intellect is just a negative trait of dumbfucks. 

I believe the difference lies in unnecessarily **reducing** an entire group of people to a single negative trait. 'Dumbfuck' is synonymous to 'person with lower intellect'. So long as this is the word does not act as a pointer to any other group of people, no group of people is being reduced to idiocy. This makes sense- what harm can come from making a community associate dumbfucks with being dumbfucks?

In fact, I do not think the trait has to even be negative. \*insert supporting arguments\*

While a lower intellect is a common negative trait of those with intellectual disabilities, using intellectual disability itself rather than its trait can be extremely 'otherizing', as Destiny puts it.

This 'otherizing' also fuels segregation in the minds of the individuals a part of the practicing communities.

A parallel can be drawn in calling someone 'poor' instead. If it were statistically deduced that poor people, perhaps as a result of a lack of access to proper education, displayed the same trait, it is clear to see how damaging common use of this word, used in this way, can be to a community.

But can 'dumbfuck' fit in this parallel? It can be argued that, as a class of peoples, dumbfucks do not choose to be so (anti-free will), and a lower intellect is just a negative trait of dumbfucks. 

I believe the difference lies in unnecessarily **reducing** an entire group of people to a single negative trait. 'Dumbfuck' is synonymous to 'person with lower intellect'. So long as this is the word does not act as a pointer to any other group of people, no group of people is being reduced to idiocy. This makes sense- what harm can come from making a community associate dumbfucks with being dumbfucks?

In fact, I do not think the trait has to even be negative. \*insert supporting arguments\*

Only now, when destiny finally turns on him do you soy out and talk about how bad he was. You are guilty of enabling it for months including destiny.

449,Destiny,"I have noticed some online debaters using a debate tactic that I am tentatively going to call ""honeypotting"". How this works is that you make a point during a debate that is unrelated to the conversation that you are currently having that sounds outrageous and you know that your opponent will call you out on. However, while this point may sound outrageous and indefensible, it is actually an argument that you know that you can win. Basically, you are baiting your debate opponent to challenge you on a topic that you know more about so that you can get an easy W and decrease your opponents confidence.

Here is an example of ""honeypotting"": 

Suppose you are having a debate about climate change. Now suppose that mid conversation, you casually mention that it is morally permissible to have sex with dogs. You opponent immediately challenges you on this claim because  they believe that it is easy to argue that sex with dogs is immoral. However, little do they know that you are far more well versed in the dog fucking discourse than they are and you destroy them on this point. You bring up the fact that your opponent is a hypocrite because they consume animal products and therefore pay people to rape animals via artificial insemination in factory farms. Your debate opponent then realizes he has no way to attack ""dog fucking"" without conceding that eating meat is immoral and he is forced admit that its ok to fuck your dog.

Although the dog fucking question has nothing to do with climate change, the purpose of bringing up the topic is to make your opponent look bad in the eyes of their audience because they were destroyed in an argument that they were confident that they could win. This will also decrease the confidence of your debate opponent and will make them nervous which increases the chances of them slipping up later in the climate change debate.

 I don't respect therapy, because I'm a streamer. Because I debate, discuss, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  
I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a streamer. When I feel like it. So...you asked.

Me personally, I've been using the internet forever, on all these weird forums, I've seen certain taboo words used so many times I have become completely desensitized to hearing them.

One day I was watching casino and one of the characters said the sand n word. As someone who is pretty desensitized I was shocked to hear it, it felt different but the reason why was probably because it wasn't something I heard someone say in a long time. I

Basically my point is, when you avoid using certain words, when someone actually says it, there's an added shock factor, it seems more potent therefore having more power.

So you could say not saying certain words makes them feel less diluted thus actually empowering people that actually want to use them in a malicious way.

my question is what do we do as a community, and what will destiny do as our ""leader""?

on the one side (the white wolf) we as a community and destiny as a leader can ignore mr\[redacted\] and let him be. we will not bring him up or give him any attention. this will alowe mr\[redacted\] to contact whoever and say whatever he wants. we have seen the type of obsession and dedication he has in the dr.k drama, and we have seen what damage he did in that drama.

on the other side (the dark wolf) we as a community and destiny as a leader can go to war against mr\[redacted\] and hunt him until he is gone. we will brigade him and make his life a living hell. this path would ruin mr\[redacteds\] life, it would be a living hell. we have seen how coordinated and dedicated the dgg community can be when given a common goal and directions in the r\\place war. this path however will be a controversial one, outsiders like miss.K will be able to point at us and say ""i told you they were brigading"".

The Lex Fridman interview was a moment for Steven to gain massive amounts of traction beyond the DGG sphere and I think instead of a tactical nuke going off it was a modest box of TNT. 

The overall tone was ""okay"" but I'd like to view this from the external. Imagine you're someone who has never heard of Destiny, none of his well conceived views, none of his sexy antics and this is your first exposure. Would this be the kind of interview that you would share with friends? Was there a standout clip that you would pass on to someone to convince them to give Steven your attention?

The metrics I am looking at to further support this point is both at home and away. Socialblade has not seen a spike of new subscribers (typical 1000 new per day) and on this very subreddit discussion barely circles the interview beyond a celebratory pat on the back.

(To me) tonally it felt less like a conventional interview with an intellectual and more like a friend with a large audience doing a favor for another friend with a smaller audience. Though I must admit that their chemistry was fantastic, I think it felt more casual and less thought provoking. 

Just to wrap up my own thoughts and I'd love to hear those of others, after listening to the entire interview there wasn't a single moment that I'd pinpoint and clip for a perspective fan, ""this is the reason you need to give this guy more attention, listen to what he says right here about this thing."" The few times that it felt like he was about to gain some momentum, Lex pushed back by asking if he had any actual data and the answer was - honestly, no.

So today Destiny briefly talked about the message the ANIME Attack On Titan has about fascism and militarism. So as a long time viewer of Destiny I was intrigued.

It was the fourth or fifth viewer call in he took today (the one that said he felt like Eren Jager) and they shortly spoke about how the anime really has nothing insightful to say about genocide or the modes of government or any of that stuff. It was a short conversation, but I think Destiny made really clear how he felt about the show.


So to quickly summarize Destiny's point, he said that while the anime is fun and simple, it doesn't have any perspective about how a government should be run or the moral implications about the genocide of a whole population.
Now, here is the thing: GENOCIDE is a theme that actually is more relevant to our time than probably ever before. Except maybe the third reich, which the show leans on in some way I think. But I doubt the Nazis ever watched Attack On Titan.

Destiny said that he ENJOYED watching Attack On Titan, even though it never really engages with the subject of genocide or the purity of a population ever!


The viewer stated that he almost felt like Erin Jaeger, but in the real world it's actually about CAPITALISM - so, for anyone not knowing - Erin Jeager is a character in Attack On Titan. While you might think he has a minor role, some might identify strongly with him to a point they draw parallels to the real world.
The anime is about the plots of Eren Yaeger and the old military!
Destiny actually admitted that the show gets wild, but in his perspective remains very simple in how there are GOOD GUYS and BAD GUYS!


Now, the anime doesn't spend a lot of time exploring the real ins and outs about what it would mean to live in a fascistic empire was his point. BUT, now here's my perspective: Eran Yeager could actually be seen as identification figure for someone who watched the anime.
Not me for sure, I never watched Attack On Titan, but maybe I actually will some time. It really sounds like a fun show, even though it isn't a deep dive into fascism.

665,Destiny,"I would like to pitch the idea of something like monthly town halls with the chat/reddit/discord communities instead of considering the most upvoted reddit memes and comments, chat's emotes and emails as the general sentiment of the community. Allow a reddit post and discord channel to consolidate and elaborate on their thoughts and bring some of those people on stream to address these issues. 

With the way things are going, it's becoming too easy for the average person to look at the reddit and not think ""damn these guys hate this person"" *when in reality we have serious issues with some of these people and our concerns aren't being addressed*. Engaging with the community more directly might help curb overall resentment toward people who we might be wrong about, especially since *SOME* of these people provably hinder the important conversations we want to listen to. Lav is a great example of this as, in my individual opinion, barely 1/4th of her contribution to any given conversation is constructive and the other 3/4ths of her contributions are actively deconstructive (destructive feels too strong for how much I'm generalizing).

A lot of people don't like Lav, but writing us all off as Anti-Lav/lAv DeRaNgMeNt SyNdRoMe/misogynistic only addresses the extreme end of the people who dislike her and helps bolster the false narrative that DGG is ""crazy,"" especially when Destiny says almost exactly this on stream for everyone to clip and circlejerk over.

I'm not saying anything could have been changed or must be changed in the future, but I am saying that if Destiny wants genuine non-schizo feedback, I believe he could take steps to cut through the memes and anger and get to the root of the issues that we as a whole believe have merit. People who get their feelings hurt because we're mean claim Destiny should have more control over the reddit and discord to stop us, but maybe just communicating with us could be better than that. We shouldn't have control over him ever, but we could be better understood.

TLDR: Constructive community feedback across reddit and discord could be addressed more often to better the community as a whole, while still not controlling us/letting us control him.

I will not elaborate further. 4thot arm me. Max got it twisted.",Suggestion: DGG Community Town Halls and More Direct Community Engagement,1668281206,"Suggestion: DGG Community Town Halls and More Direct Community Engagement I would like to pitch the idea of something like monthly town halls with the chat/reddit/discord communities instead of considering the most upvoted reddit memes and comments, chat's emotes and emails as the general sentiment of the community. Allow a reddit post and discord channel to consolidate and elaborate on their thoughts and bring some of those people on stream to address these issues. 

With the way things are going, it's becoming too easy for the average person to look at the reddit and not think ""damn these guys hate this person"" *when in reality we have serious issues with some of these people and our concerns aren't being addressed*. Engaging with the community more directly might help curb overall resentment toward people who we might be wrong about, especially since *SOME* of these people provably hinder the important conversations we want to listen to. Lav is a great example of this as, in my individual opinion, barely 1/4th of her contribution to any given conversation is constructive and the other 3/4ths of her contributions are actively deconstructive (destructive feels too strong for how much I'm generalizing).

Crying and playing victim but than getting angry and yell at Kayla using personal information only because Kayla got mad at someone

Lav wanting to be liked by everybody

Lav switching her opinion every moment and being impulsive

Going through 10 emotions in one hour

Having certain NPD traits

Easy to manipulate by someone who would have NPD (fear of abandonment)


Sure, I'm psychoanalyzing. 
But isn't lav showing HEAVY traits for borderline personality disorder? 
It isnt important but to me she has more than a many traits.

Especially:

Splitting on Kayla mid convo from 0 100 in 1 sec

Idealizing mrgirl because people cant say he eats baby's and she would still stay he did not mean it that way, he just needs nutrients

Splitting on ana from ""abuse victim"" to ""crazy woman"".

Gaslighting everyone about remarks like Harvey weinstein

Shifting attention to herself to play victim

Manipulation

I'm not too familiar with how this all works, but shouldn't those buybacks just inflate the value of the company and have no effect on the pricing of its products?

Buybacks just reduce the number of available shares which in turn means less available while the demand is unchanging which in turn means those prices go up in value. At no point in this is the actual product involved in this. Just because Adidas is valued higher doesn't mean their shoes cost more.

No stupid bad faith nonsense, and very fun and conversational. I enjoyed seeing Lex get a bit more personal and trolly with Destiny. The comments on the main video were also quite positive.

Then I read the clip channel and you could see the free thinking \*centrists\* Destiny railed against in the podcast come out and it was clear that Destiny lost a lot of people he probably could have made inroads with.

&gt; I love how Lex has grown into one of the most reasonable voices on the Internet and holds his guests accountable for their hyperbolic BS, regardless of “side”.  Good job, Lex! Thank you! 

There's lots more, you can find by just reading through the comments, but you get the idea  


Basically, I think Destiny underestimated ~~how fucking dumb~~ the different world view, a decent chunk of Lex's audience  has and did a worse job than normal of speaking to them.  


On red pill podcasts Destiny will be very kind and gentle in explaining to people who treat women like objects why maybe women are actually pretty neat and fun and worth talking to. On this podcast Destiny bluntly stated that most Joe Rogan fans believe stupid things in large part because of who Joe Rogan platforms and how Joe Rogan presents information. This was ~~too much for the fans tiny minds~~ too incompatible for many of Lex's audience world view and caused them to stop listening to Destiny.

It's just overall disappointing and not at all surprising people claiming to be all sides free thinkers immediately turn their brain off the moment they hear someone presenting a different world view. It sucks that it seems like Destiny needs to treat most people like wayward children and can't even say basic things like ""there's a difference between dems saying 2016 was tainted and republicans saying 2020 was stolen"", but yeah, what ya gonna do.

I wanted to make this post because I've seen many people repeating this claim that ""we"" (the world) didnt know about the sexting between Steven and redacted.  


Everyone. every DGGer needs to know this is a total lie, I've watched a lot of REDACTED's looping streams, and she will say this almost every time.  


I remember many times over the last year that REDACTED has said on stream that her and destiny have been sexting the whole time.

  
So its a lie that mrgirl is putting out, everyone who has watched any of her loop streams knew and its no secret at all that Steven has been friendly with her.

  
It needs to be reiterated that everyone knew they were sexting and it wasn't a bombshell that max is making out it to be.

From my limited knowledge of Ana and the situation she was a lady Destiny had relations with and she turned out to be a crazy stalker. And recently he has said that she is finally chill. In my mind the implication is the crazy lady has finally left me alone and now I can get back to my life. And I feel this is the narrative he was pushing. When Mr \[Let me finish\] brought up they are currently sexting it felt like a manipulation. Now idc if Destiny shares any of his personal information. But this feels like something he would call out if someone else did it. Publicly denouncing someone but in private sexting them and wondering why they are still so crazy.  


If there are a bunch of stray cats around the neighborhood and you ask a neighbor do they know why. And they say they don't. Only for you to find out they have feeding them the greatest cat food this here side of the Mississippi, it feels like you were lied to.  


Now I don't agree with whatever Mr \[Let me finish\] is doing. But after this point its hard to believe anything Destiny says about his relationships with these women.

730,Destiny,"One of the most manipulative things that I think Max, and now Lav, do is using someones response to a statement or event in oder to retroactively prove a point

The most direct example is from Mr Girl arguing with destiny around the Fuentes arc, then accusing destiny of being ""abnormally defensive"", because of how long they spent arguing around the Fuentes arc. Basically starting a fire and then pointing to that fire as evidence.

The worst, but also most transparent uses of this tactic are when Mr Girl or Lav will say something triggering, and then use that triggered reaction as evidence that the claim they made is valid. ""Doesn't the fact that you're reacting this way say something about you?"" 

Obviously we have the Ana situation with Lav, where she brings Ana up in a convo and then when Destiny gets angry, then Mr Girl uses that anger as evidence to strengthen the point he's making about orbiter mistreatment. Then, last night with Erudite, Lav implies that Destiny calling Mr Girl a rapsist on the previous day's stream somewhat validates what Max is doing, ignoring the fact that Max had started making his accusations before that stream even started. Do something shitty to someone, they lash out, and then you point to their reaction as the reason you were right to do that shitty thing.

734,Destiny,"Ever since i got into this open one-sided relationship with Destiny/Steven, it seems like he never reaches out to me or attempts to be in touch with me in any way. 
     
     It seems like he is willing to give sheep-like and psychopathic people more attention than someone who respects and looks up to him. I understand how there can be no content associating with me because i dont have drama with him but he can at least be more engaging than he has been with me. 

     My lack of boundaries when it comes to conversations is very slim and is primarily why I'd be willing to share almost anything with him on a personal level.

     At this point i know him enough to know we are very similar but where i lack in i wish to gain with his guidance. I cant be a big or small streamer because of my illness and i have no shot at getting his attention otherwise it seems. I could be his first long lasting good friendship this year that transcends past this ""cant keep a new friend made in 2022"" trend. But he is playing games it seems 

     Also im 24 like Lav but I'm biracial [black/white]. Destiny doesnt really influence me the way i wish because where he stands on things tend to be the same as me. 

     I found destiny on youtube like 3 months ago and he hasn't changed my mind on anything which is why im so intrigued and interested in engaging in a non-dramatic conversation with him. I could never conceive a thought or a reason to start drama or to harm him by slandering what he stands for or what his opinions are just to get noticed by him. 

     So the result is hoping he sees this and I'd assume i have a very slim to no chance of this being seen by him because at this point its more of a cope for myself so i could say at least i tried and reached out. I love this community.

Homosexuality was normalized throughout the Greco-Roman period and the edo period 1600 - 1800  . It wasn't considered abnormal but just a normal urge to have . In fact , Greco-Roman period considered pederasty to be the highest form of love which is something we find absolutely disgusting today .

&amp;#x200B;

At one point, one of the girls brought up that skinnyphobia is a problem and just as bad. It was dismissed somewhat quickly but I want to bring attention to this since its something Im very passinate about. It effects not just women but the men attracted to this body type.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, I think its WORSE than Fatphobia in a lot of ways.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **People defend THICC attraction, but not STICC attraction**

&amp;#x200B;

On the male side, whenever I express attraction to this body type, there will ALWAYS be a thicc chaser that feels the need to say ""Naaaah Im more into girls with meat on their bones"". If someone likes some thicc girl, its always cool. But if I like a STICC, everyone needs to throw in their 2 cents that they arent into that. Its like everyone needs to explain that they disapprove, without outright saying it.

&amp;#x200B;

On the female side, whenever I go into the comments section of a skinny girl, there is ALWAYS someone that says ""someone get this girl a sandwhich!"" Often times the girl isnt even undereating, she just has a fast metabolism. Its downright shaming this body type. Online, you rarely see this in reverse anymore. If you attack a thicc body type, you'll get smoked. But attacking a STICC girl seems A-OK.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Pressures girls to get implants**

Because people never shut up about their distaste/indifference for STICCs, it pressures girls to get booby and booty implants. Which sucks. This body type is already somewhat niche with growing obesity in America, but now the girls that do have this body type end up just up modifying themselves. Leaving even less for STICC enjoyers. You guys are ruining the diversity out there.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Calling this body type pedophilia**

This makes the problem a thousand times worse, because STICC women want to be viewed as grown adult women, not young girls. I think this is the main reason people feel the need to voice their distaste for STICCs, to not appear pedophilic. Its extremely destructive for women pysche, it discourages men from liking this body type, and probably the main driver to pressure women to get implants.

&amp;#x200B;

Not everyone needs to have the same body, if everyone was attracted to the same type, we'd all would look exactly the same. These are all problems that come with Skinnyphobia, while Fatphobia doesnt have to deal with.

*""What we saw the officer witness was a large knife in his hand, struggling with this female, and we saw him get back on top of the female with the knife,"" Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said, adding that an investigation continues. ""This is based on the time that the threat is present.""*

*Harrison said it was unknown how many times Moorehead was struck and that the medical examiner will confirm that information. More than a dozen gunshots were heard on the videos.""*  


Overkill? I'd like to see something like this discussed. Yet another Baltimore shooting involving a cop. Bit of uproar that it was overkill, but mentions that Tyree was a neighborhood nuisance and that neighbors, including his partner wanted this outcome. It's unknown, but it's mentioned that the woman he attacked in the street was not his partner, but a woman he attacked in the street at knifepoint, allegedly attempting to sexually assault her, too."

813,Destiny,"This year has been great overall.

A lot of growth for the channel and the community, lots of new people. With that, some issues arise.

\-Steven needs to to have all his ducks in a row when it comes to how he presents his past, his life, or the opinions he has to new people

\-The best showings this year may have been in the redpill arc. The debate with Myron was great and both did extremely well.

\-The patience he had with Sneako was commendable, the fact that even Sneako's audience agreed on multiple occasions that Steven was right speaks for itself

The concerns:

\-There's this thing that Steven does on stream where he semi-rambles about a topic, giving a rushed rant about a certain topic and his complaints about something related to it. That is fine for DGG. That is not fine when you have another audience listening to you. Similar to this when a new public person asks a question about a topic he covered before, he acts excited (for the lack of a better word, he's transmitting he has strong beliefs about that topic, like he already gets semi-triggered by how that panned out or was generally presented by other people) then he totally speedruns over it any%. This is bad. Easiest example is losing an IRL audience over the Covid stuff when he said horse de-wormer. He knows those people shut their brains in that very moment and shouldn't have said it, but it probably feels so beaten to death that it's annoying and boring to throw a better structured methaphorical wall of verbal text at them, therefore he speedruns any%. 

\-Over time it feels like there's a carelessness relating to ""stupid"" topics or topics related to more famous persons. examples: the multiple wrong storytelling of Lauren Southern boat flare ~~gun~~ incident, Jordan Peterson stuff (he was always highly critical of him, not just after the benzos, even if he acknowledged his psychology/self-improvement takes are ok), Joe Rogan(Rogan tries to ""balance"" guests that he invites on the show to represent both sides since his move to spotify and the covid controversy, you should make the audience aware that you know that). The unhinged vitriol he's shown multiple times for Kyle Kulinski unprovoked (that doesn't mean without merit), the Peterson strawman voice, [he brought this edited meme clip as real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpaS2_EZ0F8), twice at a several months distance. First time he found out from chat it's edited, the second time it happened months later he took offense when a chatter asked him if he was bad faith or if he forgot he brought it up before and banned them. 

To a certain extent he's a performer, and like a performer he should be able to perform to a certain level to satisfy the audience and capture new people.

These new drama frogs are not domesticated, and Max stumbled in with this stupid drama at the perfect time to fuck their brains up. The last thing you want is your opinions you spewed so many times so eloquently to be misconstrued because you're now bored and trying to remember what's the fastest version to say that what you said the last time you had to remember what you had to remember when you said it the first time. 

The Lex convo was good, a big part of it was great and part was messy. Some topics he covered so many times so fucking well were botched or poorly presented for new viewers. On the bad words part he didn't even get into the public/private use argument. They looped for half an hour on the r-word, but that's more on Lex than Destiny tbf. 

He said in the convo with Lex that when he's having a convo with another content creator he knows he's not only speaking to that content creator but their audience also, so I know he knows this, but he should really consider that more, because everytime I hear ""oh, man \*giggles\*"" I know he's gonna go in on some topic with some quick remarks under-breath which are gonna confuse new audiences. That's fine if he gets the chance to elaborate further but he may not always get the chance to do so, he's not the one controlling the flow of the conversation, so why not say it proper the first time, the audience is listening, you may not have thair ear later, you may even throw the ""oh man"" first but compose yourself no jokes and speak plainly.

I remember the Covid talks after he was full to the brim with research shit, it was fucking glorious. Coming up with bullet points from those convos to new people without laying out the foundation and context is rhetorically iffy.

Some of this may seem obvious, some unnecessary, and some completely wrong, but considering the spheres we're bumping at the moment, I feel like it was important, even if only 5% of this feedback he'll find useful.

* Consistently sees themselves as the victim in all interactions

Long time lurker, first time poster.

First let me say what Max tried to do is fucked up. He doesn't have, or at least hasn't shown, anything which merits the claims he is making. But that doesn't mean there isn't a problem.

It is very weird for Destiny to be engaging sexually or romantically with Ana. I do believe him when he says he does well with girls, which makes this much stranger. If it isn't a matter of being hard up, there seem to be two possibilities. One, he has some sort of compulsion. Or two, he kind of has an addiction to this type of person. (See: Lav, Chaery)

This woman has a lot of issues, which BEFORE he could say he didn't know about. But he does know about them now, and knows that she is fixated on him. Is it appropriate, knowing those things, to engage with her intimately?

There's another issue. This video is like a spotlight on why this is fucked up. It's timestamped to the relevant portion, which in light of what's going on takes on a different character. Ana refers to sexting from Destiny around the time when she makes the infamous ""You called me Princess"" remark, which she was mocked for. Why is this a healthy, or fair, thing to do to this girl? She doesn't seem ok to me, and its clear that Destiny knows she's not ok. It doesn't matter how she's acting towards him privately; look at how unhinged she's capable of being, and all in the context of their romantic past.

890,Destiny,I Should start by saying I might not have full context. I watch some but not all of Mr Girls content and some but not all of Destinys content. I will also say I definitely think Mr Girl is in the wrong in the recent drama. But in Destiny's recent video he said he steal manned Mr girl making pro r\*pe videos. If even at the time he thought they were pro r\*pe videos the why would he steal man them? I completely understand Destiny being upset about the recent drama but it kind of feels like he suddenly think Mr Girls is an abusive r\*pist when before he was friends with him and would argue that his videos were misunderstood. So it kind of feels like Destiny suddenly changed his position on these videos because he is mad at Mr Girl or destiny has been intentionally defending someone who he thinks genuinely is pro r\*pe and abusive but just did not care before. Neither of which seems good. I hope people won't be upset for me saying this I may just genuinely not understand or be missing some context but I just want to understand better.,Mr. Girl seems to be in the wrong with what he is doing against destiny but I don't understand Destiny's position on Mr Girls videos.,1668224151,Mr. Girl seems to be in the wrong with what he is doing against destiny but I don't understand Destiny's position on Mr Girls videos.

897,Destiny,"I accept my conduct on the 1st of april 2020 for committing this offence, and the seriousness of the matter. I do believe in society the use of drugs is a net negative to not only us as a society but as an individual. But I do believe the consequences of our actions do mould us to be better, and do better. For that i thank you for finding me on the night of 1st of april 2020, and I understand that this is a serious offence which I will never repeat..

This letter is foremost an apology not to only you, but to society, and  to law enforcement. This includes the paramedics who had assisted me, too you and your other colleagues with treating me with nothing but respect during our interaction. 

At the time of the offence i was 20 years of age, i do believe it was a transitional period of my life. I was a drug addict, it was beginning of covid, everyone was living at home, i could no longer hide my drug addiction, i was within a group of friends who wanted neither growth for me but had been victim to the same root expression of drug addiction, escapism, nihilism, and bitterness for where our actions had led us. The consequence of  drugs are mostly hidden in a myriad of hedonism, but really it is a an empty bottle i was anxious, depressed, day after day having my family see high everyday,  due to the enjoyment no longer being unsustainable but having turned into being a slave, but now a survivour to the constriction drugs do place on you to question whether am i alive or am i living. Apart from my mental health, the root issue was I failed university. I was working a job I hated in a warehouse treated like a number, that could be dropped on a whim. For some context this is not an excuse, just a reality of the situation of the time. In fact, I had never taken substance for fun. I did have tough upbringing with a schizophrenic father, and cousin who was a terrorist with the same last name. Drug use was my normal growing up, I neither condoned it but it was a fact, i was unable to process my wrongs because that’s all i knew. But after the fact i do still hold accountability, and growth which my present does illustrate about me.

Since then I have tried therapy for three months, it was not enough but due to making countless reckless financial decisions the debt disabled me to continue till this day. So instead i have been working with my doctor Suzanne located in Tullamarine speaking with honesty, and treatment to not only fix my mental health, give advice, but hold me accountable to being sober, and staying sober. I had further faced the wrath of my actions having been kicked out of home for a year learning the reality of the world nearly facing homlessness, neither my parents condoned  my actions or enabled me. Since then I have learnt numerous life skills from learning to drive manual, cook,clean, wash my clothes, and learnt how to study again. As of now I'm learning how to swim. This hiccup in my life, challenged me on a deep psychological, and philosophical level questioning, day after day what is my purpose, who am i, what am i, and who do i want to become. I read Socrates, Plato, Dostosevsky, read on existentialism, objectivism, absurdism, learnt myself to an extant without drugs, and the libertarian approach it curates.I finished my diploma, and currently working towards getting my bachelors of IT, then  hopefully transferring into computer science with my credited subject. With the work of my doctor I became sober, got a job in banking and finance with drastic improvements with my mental health and those around me who I do love.  I mended countless relationships, but lost many for me to grow. In fact i do have work friends but having numerous people to call friends in the past i have none now.

It’s not because of my extreme nature of being quite enigmatic, well that partly, and my sober friends moving on from my life due to addiction, which I support.  But on the other hand,  since our last time we had been in contact. My cousin had stolen my phone, and exposed my bi-sexuality. Having come from a socially conservative community, I had been outcasted, bullied and humiliated, and was physically assaulted. So I do suffer a lot of loneliness, depression  and anxiety. I hope I can keep this one mistake to be left in the past with a diversion program working with the prosecution, but still hold accountability on my end. 

Having had the realisation that the world can be beautiful, but having seen how dark it can be to an extent, I do wish to help others in some form one day with drug addiction, which is one of my dreams. So I do believe generosity is the best apology, it’s to give back, and begin therapy once in the financial position i will. For the time being I will donate 150 to my aunty back in africa facing the worst drought in 40 years in somalia, where countless amounts of people are dying in somalia. I will donate 150 to Turning point, a drug addiction organisation, By november 18th.",Is this a good apology letter to a judge and police officer,1668219641,"Is this a good apology letter to a judge and police officer I accept my conduct on the 1st of april 2020 for committing this offence, and the seriousness of the matter.

Y'all gotta stop underestimating Lav like she is just confused and ignorant about her actions. 

This is a comment I wrote didn't feel like rewording it for this post.

Holy crap. Lav is completely unhinged. She takes zero accountability and finds excuses for everything. She even stated herself she isn't looking to change, she obviously just wants everyone to wave away any mistakes she makes. She downplays the mistakes she makes as if they weren't that bad or they weren't really her fault. When that fails however she tries to explain that whatever she did or said to/about the person that they deserved it. I hope Destiny thinks critically on this. Best case scenario Lav continues on this path and doesn't harm anyone. Worst case scenario she pulls a Mr.Redacted or worse. But it seems to me that if pushed against a wall she will in fact take that route. It is very unsafe for Destiny to keep her around.

I hope the people in Destiny's ear are aware of this and I hope he is aware of this.

People thought Mr.Redacted was innocent and just ""really trying his best"" that's a huge error. Mr.Redacted was always like this and simply revealed his true colors. He was ALWAYS like this. Destiny didn't ""turn him into this"".

Lav is the same way. Stop trying to explain away her words and what she's saying, her mannerisms, and her manipulations. I'm not saying she is a mastermind but she is clearly aware of what she is doing. If mastermind is 10 and a ignorant clumsy fool is 1 (weird scale I know), Lav is without a doubt a 7. You could argue a 6 probably. 

I will reiterate it again. Lav is very aware of what she is doing, but she is planning on doing it and weaseling her way out of whatever consequences show up.",Lav Take,1668215471,"Lav Take I haven't even seen the full chat but I've seen several clips.

# Why it matters

Pandemics kill millions of people and have a huge impact on society. It is imperative that we prevent as many future pandemics possible due to the long term costs on humanity. Adding up the death and sickness it causes the world's population over the entire time the virus circulates, makes pandemics extremely costly. It is clear we need to prevent future pandemics. Currently we have labs around the world that monitor and research virus, looking for future potential pandemics and trying to figure out how to prevent them or how to develop vaccines. If that work caused a pandemic, then we need to re-evaluate if we should continue it, or how we should continue it. If it had nothing to do with it, then maybe if pandemic prevention research was given more money or oversight it could have prevented covid-19.

The answer to this question has huge implications for many researchers across the globe and has implications for how governments spend money going forward.

# Natural Origin

## Scientific Support

I will not be sharing circumstantial evidence as we have real papers that have influenced my thinking. If there is something major I am missing please comment with it.

First major paper claiming to know origin: [The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 | Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9). This paper was taken by many to be definitive for rebuking the lab leak and labeling it a conspiracy. As a result it was not seriously considered for many months.

Second major paper:  [The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was the early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic | Science](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abp8715), I believe this is the one Density was citing with Lex. This paper is part of a pair of papers. One does some complex statistical analysis on where samples were found in the wet market after it was shut down and shows a heat map linking it to where animals known to be potential hosts of COVID-19 were kept. Here is one of the authors discussing the findings: [https://theconversation.com/the-covid-lab-leak-theory-is-dead-heres-how-we-know-the-virus-came-from-a-wuhan-market-188163](https://theconversation.com/the-covid-lab-leak-theory-is-dead-heres-how-we-know-the-virus-came-from-a-wuhan-market-188163).

The third paper:  [The molecular epidemiology of multiple zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 | Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8337). This paper shows that two early linages of the virus, A and B. It concludes that A evolved into B or the other way and instead both have an unknown parent. This unknown parent is assumed to be from nature because the spillover date from the lab due does not give enough time for the lab virus to evolve into both linages A and B.

## Short steal man:

Almost every virus in circulation today come from natural spill over. We have had new viruses introduced to the world from wet markets in China, and other places live animals are sold. Occam's Razor suggests natural origin is more likely. It has taken years to find the natural reservoir in the past so not finding one yet isn't proof of lab leak. We have near enough relatives in nature that it is not definitive that it came from a lab and could have instead evolved in an unknown host for some time before spilling over to people.

## Weaknesses:

The proximal origin paper authors had conflicts of interest and that major claims in the paper, such as it not having any marks of laboratory construct turned out to be false. The state of the art virus manipulation is able to edit genetic code without leaving behind clear markers. I don't think it is being cited anymore as a pro natural origin paper.

Limitations for the Huanan Seafood/Zoonotic papers are not as clear cut as the first paper, though I don't think it is quite a death knell. One of the assumptions in both papers is that the virus started late October. If it started sooner, say August, than the A and B lineage paper needs to rework evolution probabilities with a longer time to evolve. This would weaken the assertion that this couldn't have evolved from a lab leak as there is more time to evolve. This also means the samples that were analyzed from the wet market were older and gives more time for a human to have given the virus to an animal. These criticisms do not strengthen the lab leak argument, instead just weakens these papers. Evidence that it was circulating before October is very strong:  [Researchers find coronavirus was circulating in Italy earlier than thought | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-italy-timing-idUSKBN27W1J2). Also [China ‘began stockpiling PPE months before Covid outbreak’ (telegraph.co.uk)](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/10/08/china-began-stockpiling-ppe-months-covid-outbreak/), not a fan of this source so treating this as circumstantial evidence that China knew something was going on in September. This puts the spill over/lab leak more likely in August, again this doesn't strengthen lab leak, instead it weakens the two papers supporting natural origin. Others will also discredit the first paper saying that the data they used was given to them by China and we know it was a subset of the data. They suspect that data was held back that would have shown more ties to WIV instead of the wet market. Weight cannot be given to either argument based on missing data, instead all the data would need to be added and re-evaluated and new conclusions drawn as more data could strengthen or weaken either theory. Another shortcoming is that they expected a person infected from the lab to have also infected people on the way to the wet market, which would cause multiple epicenters within Wuhan, which is not seen. This same logic applied to their own story causes more problems though. The closest known relatives for the virus are in bats not found near Wuhan. This means they somehow were transported 100's of miles to Wuhan without causing multiple simultaneous outbreaks along the transportation routes. This is a much bigger problem for natural origin than lab leak. This is a known effect when other animals cause spill over events.

The experts for viruses often are funded through grants where they go and collect and sometimes modify natural viruses. If this is shown to be a lab leak this would most likely cut a large amount of funding as well as make the research they do today much more difficult. ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it."" This introduces a bias that is hard to account for and I believe is part of the reason this question has gotten so political. This doesn't add any weight to lab leak, but it is a bias that needs to be accounted for. This could be the whole reason Lab Leak was called a conspiracy at the start and really is a very un-scientific stance.

# Lab Leak

## Circumstantial Support

There are no scientific papers that I know of that support lab leak. Instead, lab leak is based more on looking at what how the Chinese government responded, genetics of the virus and how those in the US with conflicts of interest have answered/not answered questions.

First lab leak depends on it being possible:  [Escaped Viruses (armscontrolcenter.org)](https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Escaped-Viruses-final-2-17-14-copy.pdf). This wouldn't be the first virus to escape, what would make this unique is that our tools for virus manipulation are much better than they were in the past. The counter Occam's Razor in this case is that we have never had these tools so looking at past events doesn't give a clear picture.

Second it requires WIV to not use the best safety practices, and to be working on closely related viruses: [Bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Like Coronavirus WIV1 Encodes an Extra Accessory Protein, ORFX, Involved in Modulation of the Host Immune Response - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936131/). In this paper they mention research done on bats as BSL2.  [Basics of Biosafety Level 2 | Office of Clinical and Research Safety (vumc.org)](https://www.vumc.org/safety/bio/basics-biosafety-level-2), BLS2 is not sufficient for aerosol pathogens. WIV also was working with live bats:  [The Wuhan Institute of Virology Kept Live Bats Within Its Walls | National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/yup-the-wuhan-institute-of-virology-kept-live-bats-within-its-walls/), this is in direct contradiction to what was said early on by the lead WHO investigator.

WIV took databases offline that had previously been accessable:  [(PDF) An investigation into the WIV databases that were taken offline (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349073738_An_investigation_into_the_WIV_databases_that_were_taken_offline). If WIV had been working on COVID-19 and it spilled then it would have been in the database that was taken offline, if they were not working on it then it wouldn't be.

Investigators were mislead or not answered while doing investigations into the origin:  [Jeffrey Sachs: Lessons from the COVID Commission, Lab Leak Questions, and Nord Stream — #21 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtfIIG8iYIk&amp;ab_channel=Manifold) (long watch but worth it). Grants have been released as part of FOIA requests that suggest doing the exact research that would have lead to covid-19:  [Leaked Grant Proposal Details High-Risk Coronavirus Research (theintercept.com)](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/23/coronavirus-research-grant-darpa/). This means research of the kind that could have started COVID-19 was at least being explored. It is not a smoking gun but does squash any arguments saying it cannot be done or that it wouldn't.

## Short steal man:

China as well as those in the US who had influence on research at WIV lied and covered up what research was being done in the time leading up the COVID-19. The initial spread of COVID-19 doesn't match other spillover events, and research grants had been proposed that could have lead to COVID-19. The virus itself has no obvious natural relatives that it could have evolved from in such a short time without leaving traces in wild animals.

## Weaknesses:

There are no papers detailing the work for creating COVID-19 in a lab, when viruses are created, they are cataloged and have papers released later if they are of note, COVID-19 is of note. In the case that it did come from a lab that would mean the people who did the work are conspiring to keep it a secret. WIV had knowledge of how viruses transmit to people and would have been careful in the cases it was dealing with a new unknown pathogen. Not a single piece of direct evidence exists to support lab leak. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

# Scientific Investigations:

This question has been looked into by scientist and they concluded we don't have the evidence at this point to conclude either way. This was [The Lancet COVID-19 Commission](https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/covid19), you can watch them report their findings here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AprmM4pYI6E&amp;ab\_channel=SDSN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AprmM4pYI6E&amp;ab_channel=SDSN).

# Reasonable Conclusions

Both sides have gotten too political and are not dealing with the question of what to do about it. Lab leak has people calling for Fauci's head, while natural origin supports call every person questioning if it came from a lab anti-science. Really both sides should be calling for wet markets to be abolished. Wet markets pose too much of a risk for starting pandemics and we need better public health standards across the world. Both sides should be calling for better lab regulations. How can a lab working on genetically modified pathogens know how risky they will be for people and take the right precautions? We cannot predict virus interactions with humans at this point so all new pathogens should be treated as very high risk. The Obama era definition and ban on gain of function should be re-instated, or we need a safety standard that eliminates the risk of a leak. If you are not changes that mitigate both risks then you are too politically motivated to listen to.

## Other considerations:

Senate report: [Report An Analysis of the Origins of COVID-19 (senate.gov)](https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/report_an_analysis_of_the_origins_of_covid-19_102722.pdf). Parts of it are valid criticism, while other parts are not. It is not a scientific paper, more a collection of circumstantial evidence. This is clearly politically motivated and bias.

Fauci email coverup: With the emails that have been released from Dr. Fauci in the early pandemic there is clearly an early acceptance that both scenarios are plausible with lab leak later being rejected as most likely. I have not seen anything supporting that this was an intentional coverup, and the latest batch of emails seem to support it. Brining a case against Fauci seems to be a waste of time and just a witch hunt, it would set a bad precedent for future holders of his office.

Masks/Vaccines: The origin has nothing to do with masks/vaccines. Try to untie these three issues as they are all separate scientific questions, and it is very easy to let the team you are on for one of these issues drive how you think about the other two.

**TLDR:** We don't have definitive proof of natural origin or lab leak. Both are valid hypotheses, neither one is a conspiracy. It is unscientific to say otherwise at this time. Be open to where the data leads.","Covid Origin Solved (for real this time, I did the research)",1669766550,"Covid Origin Solved (for real this time, I did the research) I used to watch Destiny play SC2, saw him on Lex and he made a statement about being sure covid came from the wet market.

This question has been looked into by scientist and they concluded we don't have the evidence at this point to conclude either way. This was [The Lancet COVID-19 Commission](https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/covid19), you can watch them report their findings here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AprmM4pYI6E&amp;ab\_channel=SDSN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AprmM4pYI6E&amp;ab_channel=SDSN).

# Reasonable Conclusions

Both sides have gotten too political and are not dealing with the question of what to do about it. Lab leak has people calling for Fauci's head, while natural origin supports call every person questioning if it came from a lab anti-science. Really both sides should be calling for wet markets to be abolished. Wet markets pose too much of a risk for starting pandemics and we need better public health standards across the world. Both sides should be calling for better lab regulations. How can a lab working on genetically modified pathogens know how risky they will be for people and take the right precautions? We cannot predict virus interactions with humans at this point so all new pathogens should be treated as very high risk. The Obama era definition and ban on gain of function should be re-instated, or we need a safety standard that eliminates the risk of a leak. If you are not changes that mitigate both risks then you are too politically motivated to listen to.

## Other considerations:

Senate report: [Report An Analysis of the Origins of COVID-19 (senate.gov)](https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/report_an_analysis_of_the_origins_of_covid-19_102722.pdf). Parts of it are valid criticism, while other parts are not. It is not a scientific paper, more a collection of circumstantial evidence. This is clearly politically motivated and bias.

Fauci email coverup: With the emails that have been released from Dr. Fauci in the early pandemic there is clearly an early acceptance that both scenarios are plausible with lab leak later being rejected as most likely. I have not seen anything supporting that this was an intentional coverup, and the latest batch of emails seem to support it. Brining a case against Fauci seems to be a waste of time and just a witch hunt, it would set a bad precedent for future holders of his office.

Masks/Vaccines: The origin has nothing to do with masks/vaccines. Try to untie these three issues as they are all separate scientific questions, and it is very easy to let the team you are on for one of these issues drive how you think about the other two.

**TLDR:** We don't have definitive proof of natural origin or lab leak. Both are valid hypotheses, neither one is a conspiracy. It is unscientific to say otherwise at this time. Be open to where the data leads."

Ironically enough, I believe the response itself contained several statistical inaccuracies:

To briefly contextualise the [relevant medical study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7106e1.htm), the primary variable of interest is the [odds ratio] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2938757/) (OR); for brevity, an OR of 1 means the treatment has no effect. Also, when the study talks about an adjusted OR (aOR), the “adjusted” part just means a statistical procedure was done, which isn’t relevant to this post.

**1: The result is insignificant, plain and simple.**

&gt;""cloth masks do nothing according to this study"" is also wrong. That study found a 56% reduction in transmission rate for cloth masks, AS THEY EXPLICITLY MENTIONED ON THE VERY ARTICLE YOU LINKED.

As per the study, cloth masks had an aOR of 0.44 with a 95% CI of 0.17-1.17. Since the null hypothesis, that cloth masks don’t affect the transmission, i.e. aOR = 1, is within the confidence interval, the result is insignificant (at that CI) and shouldn’t factor into your thinking. This is because if you continue drawing samples from the population, you may well get a result that suggests that the treatment has no effect! I’ll end this part with an excerpt from a [PubMed article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083828/) on statistical significance:

&gt;[If the result was insignificant] the researcher would conclude the study did not reach statistical significance as the p-value is equal to or greater than the pre-specified alpha. **The research would then not be able to reject the null hypothesis.** 

Recall, again, that the null hypothesis here would be ""transmission is unaffected by cloth masks"".

&amp;#x200b;

**2: This is a poor understanding of statistical significance.**

&gt;The reason why they say that this is not statistically relevant is because of the effect size and the confidence interval. The CI is so wide, because of the nature of the data observed (small sample size), that it makes the result not statistically significant, as in, their data is not clear enough to be certain that the true reduction is close enough to 56% for that number to be relevant, so further research is needed. But what it does NOT mean, is that the actual reduction in transmission rate for wearing cloth masks was found to be insignificant (as in this is not proof that masks don't work, like you said it was).

Wide CIs and small sample sizes aren’t why this result is insignificant, and it’s a bad way to think about why results are insignificant. First, the study had a sample size of 534, which isn't small. Secondly, ""wide CIs"" is a strange way to put things. For higher confidence levels (95% -&gt; 99% and so forth), the confidence intervals must necessarily widen. If they don't widen to the extent that they include the null hypothesis, you're more sure of the direction of the effect, that is to say, its significance.

There are plenty of studies with 'small' sample sizes (as u/MetalPerfect has defined them) that have significant results and ""wide CIs"". Here’s a [psychology paper](https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/doi/full/10.1177/1087054714554933) for illustration.

&amp;#x200b;

**In conclusion**

To be sure, an insignificant result neither disproves the null hypothesis nor the alternate hypothesis; instead, it makes the more reserved claim that it cannot serve as evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis at the given level of confidence. With that in mind, the cloth mask portion of  [this CDC graphic](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/social-media/mm7106e1_MaskingEffectiveness_IMAGE_04Feb22_1200x675_1-medium.jpg?_=64903) is definitely misleading.

65,Destiny,"Destiny's conversation with Ruslan KD on NoJumper was embarassing and disrespectful. Disrespectful not to me, but to God.


Destiny will be this super curious, intelligent dude when it comes to any conversation, even when dicussing strange topics like the morality of incest... But the moment a serious Christian tries to talk to Destiny about Jesus, he immediately gets dismissive and drops 40IQ points. Right when Ruslan starts talking, Destiny suddenly gets ""high"" from Adam's second-hand smoke. (Timestamp: 1:02:40 https://youtu.be/SYntNDzoCq0)


He does this EVERYTIME, to the point where it cannot be viewed as anything other than deliberate. 

Destiny has repeatedly been offered olive branches from Christians (Lauren Southern, Fuentes, Don, and now Ruslan, just to name a few) and he never takes it seriously. He's running from God. He knows Jesus is God but he is scared to accept him because he knows he'd have to change his whole life once he does. 

I know most of the people in this subreddit think God isnt real, believe Christianity is oppressive, etc, etc.. but as a high level spiritual WARRIOR, I can see what is truly going on.

I believe Destiny will come to Christ again but at the same time if he keeps rejecting God's olive branches there may be a time where God finally stops trying with him.

But the video with Nick Fuentes and Ye came out and i was really surprised how much influence Nick got , and the guy who is now stalking DEstiny called Destiny on going out with Fuentes , i thought the guy was mad and still he is but seing how thing are moving , the growing influence he has i think the guy point really made sense right now .

Not only does it prove that the guy ( i am not sure if we can name him ) was right about that subject but it also show that Destiny seem to have a contradiction when it come to the amount off responsibility he has over his viewers , i am sure Destiny isn't solely responsible for the amount off influences Nick get now , but he contributed to it .

Hi. I'm new here so don't kill me... yet... I'm not a racerealist but i have a hard time answering the question why ""black people"" as categorized in a lot of studies always show that this group, in western countries are disproportionately represented in violent crime, in pretty much every western (white majority) country. 

If it was only in US countries it would make sense to blame US systematic racism due to US history, but when the results are repeatable in every western country that doesnt make sense

Maybe it does make sense to call it a black cultural problem since most of the gangster hiphop culture is directly aimed at black ppl in western countries?

It doesnt make sense to call it a problem of racism since why would whites only be racist against blacks? jewish ppl who share the same looks as other middle easterners have massively different results where jewish ppl in general i think outperform any host people within 5 years of moving to a new country...

Could it be explained by poverty? blacks in general flee from war/extreme poverty to western EU countries, so do middle easterners alot of the time, jewish ppl usually dont...

For a racerealist this is usually their slamdunk since its repeatable throughout western countries that differ in culture, systemic racism and so on... and they would ask, if its not race related why is it repeatable everywhere in every scenario where they move?

my guess is our answer would be, they usually move from extrem poverty into the lowest strata of western white societies and they usually show the same stats as that poorer strata in western countries? so its more socioeconomical than race related...

But ye, thats my question, dont kill me.","Honest question, not a race realist, just wondering what the correct answer is to this question.",1669742327,"Honest question, not a race realist, just wondering what the correct answer is to this question. Im a semiboomer/centrist, and ive heared this community is left and I heared leftists like trigger warnings so here is your trigger warning, gonna ask about racerelated stuff and how you respond to racerealists on this topic.  


Hi. I'm new here so don't kill me... yet... I'm not a racerealist but i have a hard time answering the question why ""black people"" as categorized in a lot of studies always show that this group, in western countries are disproportionately represented in violent crime, in pretty much every western (white majority) country. 

If it was only in US countries it would make sense to blame US systematic racism due to US history, but when the results are repeatable in every western country that doesnt make sense

Maybe it does make sense to call it a black cultural problem since most of the gangster hiphop culture is directly aimed at black ppl in western countries?

It doesnt make sense to call it a problem of racism since why would whites only be racist against blacks? jewish ppl who share the same looks as other middle easterners have massively different results where jewish ppl in general i think outperform any host people within 5 years of moving to a new country...

Could it be explained by poverty? blacks in general flee from war/extreme poverty to western EU countries, so do middle easterners alot of the time, jewish ppl usually dont...

But this post isn't about this specific point (although any further insight would be appreciated). It's about human sex trafficking and its increase or decrease related to the existence (or non-existence) of the porn industry in general.

My position is that sex trafficking has always existed and that by making it legal at least now we've got some control over it. But maybe I'm coping. Maybe human trafficking numbers have increased since the legalization of porn. Maybe it's not the legalization in itself but the availability and ease of access of it through the internet and tube sites. Like some form of commodification or normalization of something that used to be pretty niche.

I honestly don't know plus I'm not finding much information about this on google (other than religious propaganda). Is there any data out there about the porn industry and how it relates (or doesn't relate) to human trafficking?

The excerpt goes:

&gt;Three: Remember it’s all luck. You are lucky to be here. You are incalculably lucky to be born and incredibly lucky to be brought up by a nice family who encouraged you to go to uni. Or if you were born into a horrible family that’s unlucky and you have my sympathy but you are still lucky. Lucky that you happen to be made of the sort of DNA that went on to make the sort of brain which when placed in a horrible child environment would make decisions that meant you ended up eventually graduated uni. Well done you for dragging yourself up by your shoelaces. But you were lucky. You didn’t create the bit of you that dragged you up. They’re not even your shoelaces.  
&gt;

153,Destiny,"&gt; **Richard V. Reeves** (born 4 July 1969) is a British American writer and scholar and a Senior Fellow at the [Brookings Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings_Institution) and director of the Future of the Middle Class Initiative. 

He's recently been on a [media](https://www.google.com/search?q=richard+reeves&amp;tbm=nws) [tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1N7gA9cA1g) promoting his book even being interviewed by [Youtubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1N7gA9cA1g). His recent book is called ""**Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do about It**"" so definitely an overlap with the internet manosphere which will definitely lead to an interesting discussion between him and Destiny. Most of his recent media has been about this newer book however I'm slightly more interested in his older book.

His older book ""**Dream Hoarders: How the American Upper Middle Class is Leaving Everyone Else in the Dust, Why that Is a Problem, and What to Do about It**"" would be a great discussion as well. We always see the internet left blame the top 0.01 percent and billionaires for rising inequality but Richard makes the case that there is a growing separation between the top 20% ""Upper middle class"" and everyone else that reduces overall social mobility. I think politically any policies that would effectively reduce this ""opportunity hoarding"" would be incredibly unpopular but also would be a great discussion between Destiny and Richard.

I think I saw Twitter hate on him before so as always there is a chance leftist twitter will say Destiny is interviewing a misogynistic academic.

I don't have any suggestions for questions that Destiny should ask but I'm sure the rest of ya'll would have good question and discussion suggestions.

175,Destiny,"So he decided to be less charitable to individuals similar to MrGirl, Annalicia and whoever may fall into saying some really sus statements.

I think that's completely fair and beneficial.

With that said, I think he should be extra careful for that attitude not to transfer off to his other types of content, specifically serious debates or high-profile showings.

What I absolutely hated years ago, and still have some problems with (to a lesser extent) now, is the high level of condescension that some political figures or internet personalities seem to have. It's a similar kind of aversion that black individuals have over woke white liberals that treat them like retarded ""uninformed"" kids, or simply put giving the vibe of having a superiority complex. 

There's a fine line between confidence and arrogance and Destiny threads that line a lot, and I can see the danger of a new viewer having a problem with that. 

Watching today's appearance on the NoJumper, I didn't really like how the Balenciaga discussion as a whole, I'm not saying he made bad arguments, but I'm saying it looks bad pushing back and risk to appear dismissive when you're not familiar with the new/fine details. 

Fortunately it was followed up with a great discussion on the trans issues where he outlined his positions very well.

There were points in the NoJumper talk where he rattled off some reference to some well-known political/philosophy term and you could see it went right over the guests's heads. Need more GIGACHAD energy to take your time and explain it properly, you're there to talk so talk more and make everything in your statement clear.

...What I wanted to say is that streamer-man should light a camp fire in this dark souls of internet shithousery. Recover back some of that research HP he had 1 year ago, sharpening that optics sword again, and being more tactical and consistent when he attacks those new mobs. Reign in the new souls gathered along the way and be ready to catch more. 

TL;DR: Destiny should be more like Richard Wolfe.

193,Destiny,"Hi, Black American here who was just as confused about the Ye/Irving controversies and black anti-Semitism as much as the rest of you. I'll get to my thoughts on how these situations should have been later. For now, this is merely about the Black Israelite beliefs, because this is very likely what both of those men have sourced their beliefs from. In fact, that's definitely the case of Kyrie Irving because the film he shared called ""Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America"" is propaganda for this exact ideology.

So this theory came about after the emancipation of slaves in the US by a fairly radical group of Black Christians in 1886. Under this belief system, Black people were part, if not the entirety, of the lost tribes of Israel. When Israel was destroyed (722 BC), the tribes scattered throughout Africa, and their descendant would be sold into slavery  and become the African diaspora of today (Essentially me and the vast majority of black people in North and South America). In fact, the Atlantic slave trade is believed to be prophesized by Deuteronomy 28:68:

&gt;And the LORD will bring you back in ships to Egypt, a journey that I promised that you should never make again; and there you shall offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.

Before I get into the huge inaccuracies, keep in mind that this was created during a time when Black Americans were almost completely disconnected from their homeland and only had Christianity to go off of, preached by White Americans who could've had similar views on Jews. With a desperate search for identity and origin story, I can see why these ideas gained attention. Now as for these ideas, they are quite wacky. This already falls apart when you realize that in the story of Jacob (of whom the lost tribes derive from) the tribes started from modern-day Israel to Southern Lebanon and were exiled to modern Syria and Iran. That's far smaller than scattering throughout West Africa, let alone the entire continent. For the sake of argument, we'll pretend this is untrue. The big problem is what I alluded to in the title. Contrary to popular belief, Africa is very ethnically diverse. Israel is located in the Middle East, which is a part of Northern Africa. The African Diaspora in North, Central, and South America mostly originated from West Africa and some pockets of South Africa. Those are VERY culturally different areas of the continent. It was also almost 2300 years between the biblical destruction of Israel and the Atlantic Slave Trade. There's no trace of Israelite culture in West Africa. This would also have to ignore the Sub-Saharan trade routes between West Africa and North Africa that were established around 700 AD, which included slavery. They would have to be present in at least West Africa for over two millennia  and be relatively unknown and left alone before they can be traded in the Atlanta Slave Trade.

You can see the inherent problem with this unfold. This is essentially culture appropriation + self-insert fanfiction, which is a shared trait with these black distortions on established religions and cultures. Its not about adopting the actual beliefs, customs, and rituals of Judaism, but rather writing a story for our people that both gives us pride and rationalizes our suffering. Because so much of our history revolves around being at the bottom of a very cruel power structure for generations, resentment of anyone different and higher up isn't difficult to come by. Combine all of this, with the traditional anti-Semite rhetoric, and the fact that Jewish people have a lot of representation in industries that African Americans have seen as the best avenues of success for a very longtime and the industries are naturally predatory/scammy results in the the two controversies that have reinvigorated the JQ debate today.

Now its difficult for me to say what should've happened to Kanye. I don't think he should've been deplatformed. However, he as a major influencer lost business partners that were contractual allowed to terminate their deals. Your image and reputation is everything when selling a personal brand and businesses are allowed to have second-thoughts when you do things a fraction as drastic as what Kanye did. Anyone calling companies willingly withdrawing from business relationships censoring or cancelling is taking things too far. While Kanye does talk about Black independence and wealth creation (something that is very old as far as discourse in the black community goes), he very clearly insinuates that the Jewish community conspires against him personally in many aspects of his life and other artists. Him speaking about Jews as a monolith and refusing to name specific people who he has conflict with is good proof of that. Frankly, I get being careful, but I hate his defenders acting anything less than ""Mr. \[REDACTED\] confesses to raping someone on camera"" levels of transparency means we can't assume anything out of what he says. Kanye seems like a lost cause for now.

Kyrie is a little different. I do think he got pushed a little too hard, and in a way that gives strength to anti-Semitic fervor  rather than weaken it. I actually think the Destiny route of having a public conversation with someone very knowlegable on Jewish culture/history could've worked out here. It would be a discussion where Kyrie would have to act in good faith or even some people that would agree could be steered away. There will always be the crazies who will pull any conspiracy theory out of their ass to say any effort to counter their beliefs is invalid, but you can't save them all.",The Theory behind Black Israelite Hebrews and the possible origin of the Ye/Irving Controversies,1669685808,"The Theory behind Black Israelite Hebrews and the possible origin of the Ye/Irving Controversies Hi, Black American here who was just as confused about the Ye/Irving controversies and black anti-Semitism as much as the rest of you.

That's right, I'm calling out a dgga. 

[This guy](https://www.reddit.com/user/Infamous_Entry1564/), in [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/z748ke/us_is_killing_millions_of_people/iy587wi/?context=8&amp;depth=9) on our sub says:

&gt; Mask mandates(especially considering there isn’t a single mask mandate anywhere in the US that distinguishes between cloth masks which do nothing and the masks that actually help), lockdowns, vaccine mandates are all really dumb policies that shouldn’t be advocated for. 

&amp;#x200B;

The claim that cloth masks do nothing is absolutely wrong. But he goes on to defend this statement by [quoting the CDC](https://i.redd.it/l3k4j95i0s2a1.png). He also links to his [previous comment](https://i.redd.it/txr0g1oh1s2a1.png) which says basically the same thing. He's linking to [this CDC article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7106e1.htm) where he quotes this:

&gt;Wearing an N95/KN95 respirator (aOR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05–0.64) or wearing a surgical mask (aOR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.13­–0.90) was associated with lower adjusted odds of a positive test result compared with not wearing a mask (Table 3). Wearing a cloth mask (aOR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.17–1.17) was associated with lower adjusted odds of a positive test compared with never wearing a face covering but was not statistically significant. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what statistical significance means, and the only reason you're latching onto that statement is because you think it validates the opinion you already believed in regardless of what science says. 

When you say ""according to studies, there is not a statistically significant difference in transmission rates for cloth masks"" this is NOT the same as when you say ""cloth masks do not make a significant difference in transmission rates"".

Let's break it down.

""according to studies"" is wrong, that's according to ONE study. 

""cloth masks do nothing according to this study"" is also wrong. [That study found a 56% reduction in transmission rate for cloth masks](https://i.redd.it/6bmqvavd1s2a1.png), AS THEY [EXPLICITLY](https://i.redd.it/2fb4m7am0s2a1.png) MENTIONED ON THE VERY ARTICLE YOU LINKED. 

The reason why they say that this is not statistically relevant is because of the effect size and the confidence interval. The CI is so wide, because of the nature of the data observed, that it makes the result not statistically significant, as in, their data is not clear enough to be certain that the true reduction is close enough to 56% for that number to be relevant, so further research is needed. But what it does NOT mean, is that the actual reduction in transmission rate for wearing cloth masks was found to be insignificant. 

You are either intentionally misrepresenting this scientific article or you simply do not have the statistical knowledge to read a basic scientific paper. Either way, stop pretending that your opinion is based in science. It's based in your feelings. 

As for whether cloth masks do reduce the transmission rate, [late 2020 studies](https://i.redd.it/ypeo4j6k1s2a1.png) conclude that [they do](https://i.redd.it/f2pu2flm1s2a1.png) and likely about as well as surgical masks. More info on [this](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html) CDC article.

In conclusion, I do not disagree that we're done with lockdowns, and done with masking except for inside hospitals, maybe retirement homes and maybe for vulnerable people. I do agree that some of the messaging was damaging or improper, and that covid ""dead enders"" as this guy is calling them, are cringe. But what's even more cringe is you fucking losers misquoting science and doing much more damage than the CDC or any lockdown ever could as you go around perpetrating misinformation.

That seemed to me to be the biggest disconnect in rhetoric around public health announcements during the pandemic. There's peer reviewed evidence about the consequences of broadcasting public health advice, and Trump was freelancing like it had never occurred to him that someone had thought about this before.

And then on the alt-media side, it may not always be the main talking point but there's always an element of ""they're acting in unison"" when the conspiratorially minded discuss public health officials and the mainstream media.

* Disney very often releases new films that they don't push very often when they're trying new things technologically. For instance Raya and the last dragon bombed, but they were using it more as a demonstration of combining all of the technologies they've made over the last several years. It's clear when Disney wants to make a movie succeed. They'll spend money on it's advertising. A lot of money. They spent basically none on this one.
* Disney has been trying to make Disney+ be the main location of all new releases, and this movie is on there. I would not be surprised if they made a ton of money on ticket sales at home, since all of the money goes to them instead of theaters. Additionally the small boost in subscriptions.
* Disney does not expect to make money on movies in theaters. Their two biggest sources of revenue are Disney, Theme parks, and products (like toys). A movie about an explorer family seems to just be a ploy for more unique attractions at the theme parks even if it is a good movie.

320,Destiny,"This is mainly a response to the criticism destiny has got for calling out Amouranth recently. The 3 arguments I have seen on the subreddit are:
 She said her husband was forcing her to stream for long hours, only stream hot tub/sexual stuff, and stay at home to stream (so no irl streams). Now she streams for less hours, streams more gaming/less sexual content, and she has done more irl. So overall she has been consistent with her complaints.
After going through Amouranth stream stats, I would like to share my thoughts.
First of all, Amouranth really hasn’t streamed for less hours. After looking through the 42 days since the incident and the 42 days before, she only streamed 60 hours less (only 15% less than her 397 hours the previous 42 days). Not only did Amouranth take a 5 day break because of the incident lowering the hours, her average stream length was 12.5hrs  (2 hours longer than the previous 42 days). We can also see in the past 42 days she has had 3 streams that have had the longest duration in over a year.
The second point seems to be true. Before, she only had about 10% of streams that were games (not including just dance). Now it’s a little over 40%. Even so, she could have still been in the hot tub while playing so it’s hard to say if it’s not comer content or sponsored content. Overall I would say it’s true that she is playing more games, but is it less sexual?
The final point is a bit more difficult to gauge because twitch con happened the week before the incident which was about 40 hours of irl content. In the past 42 days there has been around 38hr of full irl streams not sure if she irl streams during her at home streams so I can only go by full irl streams). I can’t definitely say if she has done more irl after so this is inconclusive.
In conclusion, has Amouranth changed since the break up? Not really. She still streams for super long hours, still most of her content is sexual, and (at least for the 42 days before and after) has a similar amount of irl streams hours.

“I feel like I’m one of the only people on the internet that feels like you have a responsibility to your audience.” 

I understand Destiny’s beef with this point. I get triggered by online political commentators who are unwilling to complete a thought, who will say that Trump can inspire riots and coups but deny that influencers actually, you know, influence thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. It’s frustrating, to say the least. But I don’t think Destiny’s response really gets at the meat of Shapiro’s comment. 

I don’t think that Shapiro is disagreeing with the idea that you have a responsibility to your audience. But if we’re attempting to develop a code of personal conduct vs what we hold people publicly accountable for, which seem like distinct things, we have to be able to parse somehow. 

So, for example: on one hand, we may not want to hold the \[surviving?\] Beatles responsible for Charles Manson and his acolytes and those who have been inspired by his race war rhetoric, regardless of whether or not he drew wild inspiration from Helter Skelter/The White Album. We may, on the other hand, want to hold real radical agitators like Richard Spencer responsible for things like Charlottesville. The very fact that we have to distinguish between these things (or any other examples we want to pull) suggests that the existence of person X who claims Y pundit as inspiration for Z violent act is not, on its own, sufficient evidence for us to condemn Y or attribute Z violent act causally to Y’s rhetoric. 

Destiny says, half joking, that he would stop making certain types of jokes if someone claimed they committed an act of violence because of jokes he made. That seems like the responsible thing to do, but if, god forbid, someone did commit an act of violence because of Destiny’s jokes about Yasuo mains, I doubt he would be jumping to take responsibility for that act. He might stop making those jokes in light of the incident, which would be a prudent thing to do, but he (and I) would deny a causal link between an unwell person’s violence and his obvious jokes. 

Destiny goes on to say that “a lot of this violence is expressly political in nature.” Of course it is. But the political nature of that violence doesn’t give us license to attribute responsibility to any pundit that the violent actor may have been a fan of, right? We are having wider cultural, political, and scholarly conversations about targeted acts of violence, “stochastic terrorism,” etc. Part of that conversation hinges on who we can point a finger at and say “there! That person inspired an act of terroristic violence, and deserves social/political/legal condemnation accordingly!” So of COURSE we think creators/pundits have a responsibility to their audience. The question is what sort of responsibility? Do we, as Shapiro suggests, only attribute direct responsibility when a creator/pundit explicitly calls for violence (however we determine that)? Or do we, as Destiny jokingly suggests, attribute direct responsibility when someone does something bad based on a joke you made last week?",Responsibility to your audience,1669619978,"Responsibility to your audience Re: Shapiro's claim and Destiny's response starting here: [https://youtu.be/9eolr7wIwhs?t=2335](https://youtu.be/9eolr7wIwhs?t=2335)

329,Destiny,"What is up DGG! I am seeking brave Daliban soldiers who are big fans of DnD and have free time on Sundays to join a 5th Edition West Marches Campaign I created and just finalized.  

**Some Background:** I started crafting this world and idea after hanging out in DGG chat and YouTube chat during Destiny's DnD games, seeing how many people there actually enjoy the show but don't seem to play any of the games themselves. I decided to start up a discord server where I would host DnD games weekly on Sundays, streamed on twitch, in a persistent world where player choices would have effects long lasting and game changing.

**What is West Marches?** It is a style of DnD campaign that is focused less on a regular party and more on a community aspect: the parties that play every week change based on player availability and week reservation. Right now I am only running games on Sundays as it's my only avaliable day, but that might change in the future. My goal is to aim for 4 hours for game sessions, starting at 3 PM EST at the earliest and 6 PM EST at the latest. 

**How this works**: a player who wants to play on a particular Sunday will either join with the party group that has been building to play in that session if there is a free spot, or they will start a party group if one doesn't exist for that particular Sunday for others to join. 

**If you are interested in joining the server either as a player or are just curious and want to hang out in the discord to talk dnd and other tabletop experiences, leave a comment here and I will provide you a link to the server with all the game specifics!**

**Campaign details:** A decade prior, a Cataclysmic event took place in the Kingdom of Egiondon. A Fog Bank that stretch from horizon to horizon and hundreds of feet tall rolled across the land, engulfing and warping anything it touched, racing across with the screams of countless tortured souls. The Baron of these lands constructed a shelter due to some early warning from a Seer that managed to save around 100 of the Barony's citizens, although countless more were lost to the Fog's Overwhelming Presence. Now that there is signs that this deadly Fog seems to be getting lighter across the land, brave volunteers are beginning to venture out into the lands to see what happened to the civilization left behind.",DnD DGG-ers: Seeking Brave Daliban-ers for 5e Post-Cataclysm West Marches Campaign!,1669615930,"DnD DGG-ers: Seeking Brave Daliban-ers for 5e Post-Cataclysm West Marches Campaign!

373,Destiny,"I know this post is gonna get banned, but I've been hitting the penjamin a bit too hard while listening to Zherka's convo and had brainblast and I gotta write it out.

It finally clicked! When Zherka was calling \[REDACTED\] a \[REDACTED\] because of that ""movie review"", I immediately brushed it off like always. Don't get me wrong, I was laughing, but in the back of my head I always think, ""oh, these guys don't get it, \[REDACTED\]'s not really a \[REDACTED\], he was making a broader point about society, the roles that little girls get shoved into, that teaches them that their value lies in their appearance and promiscuity. When \[REDACTED\] says they're \[REDACTED\], he is talking about the fact the fundamental roles that they are trying to inhabit are designed to elicit that type of reaction---he's using himself as a guidepost to illustrate the cracks in the system.""

But I didn't immediately realize just how unbelievably charitable that was for a guy I don't really know. Yeah, he's pointing out a problem, but this isn't just a problem that ""society"" has, its a problem that's actively contributed to by, funded by, and propagated by people who sexualize kids. A reaction like, ""these girls are \[REDACTED\]."" Probably shouldn't engender a feeling or a thought like, ""wow these actors/directors are doing a great job, their sexualization of kids was so realistic that it kinda worked."" It should be something like: ""I'm having feelings of interest in a sexual dynamic that is inherently abusive and wrong, and I should probably get some help to work through this."" 

I don't know why I automatically assumed he was playing up the first one, but really he means the second one. What am I a fucking soul-reader? what am I \[REDACTED\] all of the sudden? Jesus..

I just gave him a pass, even though with he continues to barrel ahead with blinders on, and a complete lack of capacity for understanding basic human boundaries... all of the sudden it hit me like a brick, a complete 180 of my underlying assumptions about his actions. What if he's legit just some creepy dude that wants to put his feelings out there, nailing himself like christ to the cross, dying for the sin of being a human being born into this world... But being human means to recognize our flaws, to grow and flourish in a society that works for as many as possible. If \[REDACTED\] is physically incapable of this growth and change to address whatever predilection he may have felt in that moment, then the message he was preaching was hollow in the first place, since that's the recognition and change that is vital to addressing the issues that movie was trying to illustrate (or maybe the movies garabage at trynna do that too, i have no idea).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eolr7wIwhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eolr7wIwhs) (around 16-22mins)

Claims Destiny makes paraphrased: 

&gt;The communists and the Nazis worked together against the social democrats who were the liberal establishment. The willingness of the communists to collaborate with the Nazis was at least party motivated by their belief that the Nazis were not a serious threat. There were times where the communists fought the Nazis but only a little bit. The KPD refused to ever work with the SDP.

Btw I haven’t seen the reddit post Destiny made on the Vaush subreddit so maybe his take is more nuanced and correct there. But I'm just gonna look at what he said in the video. 

Firstly it is true that the nazis and the communists did collaborate and support each other in some instances . The 1931 Prussia referendum is an example of one of these times. Another and even better example is the 1932 Berlin transport strike organized by the communists and supported by the nazis. Destiny is also right to point out that the communists like the nazis were very much a “anti-establishment” political movement not focused on parliamentary democracy. this to some extent made the sdp a common enemy. 

Where destiny is absolutely wrong though is his wider characterization of the relationship between the national socialists and communists. These parties absolutely hated each other and would under no circumstances collaborate for example in a government. One example of this is when the Nazi party and the KPD together get a 52% majority in the Prussian state election in 1932 and are absolutely unwilling to form a government with each other. The communists and the SDP did though collaborate politically quite a bit and were even in a government together once. They also collaborated in organizing the workers. The political collaboration stopped only in 1929 when the KPD skewed more left and more revolutionary. 

The KPD and the Nazis also like one of the commentators pointed out would very often engage in political violence against eachother in the 1930s. In the clip Destiny claims this only happens after the Nazis have already seized power not before. This is totally wrong. Political violence was very common in the Weimar republic after the depression and was most often instigated by either the communists or the national socialists and committed against each other. The communists did in some cases attack the social democrats as well but to a far far smaller extent. 

As noted the communist party was an “anti-establishment” party in the sense that it had no interest in the democratic process and was very unorganized and undisciplined. The communists believed in fighting for their political goals on the streets and not in parliament but this fighting was not targeted against (except sometimes) the sdp it was focused on fighting the national socialists. Their mutual disdain for parliamentary politics might have weakened the democracy they were both fighting against but it didn’t unify them. They were still focused on fighting each other. In fact, one of the main dividers of the communists and the SDP was their method of fighting fascism. Though just to be clear the KPD did become a very far left party during the depression and did not see the SDP as an ally rather a movement that stood against them. 

I think the perspective of anti-establishment and pro-establishment movements as another axiom to look at political movements through is a very useful one. But in this case Destiny relied it this way too much and almost totally disregarded the actual political goals of the respective movements and in addition to just being wrong on the facts. Claims like “the communists fought the nazis a little bit” are just patently false. 

As a source look at the Oxford Handbook of the Weimar republic part 3 chapter 15 it’s a pretty short read. As well as just random wikipedia knowledge that’s easy to fact check. 

This might be a little bit too ban baity but It’s really frustrating to see Destiny falling for the same kind of argumentation that’s often used against him. There are a few facts that do support his claim but If you read any reputable history textbook on the subject there just isn’t any way to come out of it agreeing with his characterization of the facts. The absolute same thing could be and is often done by communists to paint the SDP as Nazi collaborators. That case is at least as strong at the one destiny argues.",Destiny made some questionable claims about the nazis and communist colaborating aginst the SDP.,1669584173,"Destiny made some questionable claims about the nazis and communist colaborating aginst the SDP.

Where destiny is absolutely wrong though is his wider characterization of the relationship between the national socialists and communists. These parties absolutely hated each other and would under no circumstances collaborate for example in a government. One example of this is when the Nazi party and the KPD together get a 52% majority in the Prussian state election in 1932 and are absolutely unwilling to form a government with each other. The communists and the SDP did though collaborate politically quite a bit and were even in a government together once. They also collaborated in organizing the workers. The political collaboration stopped only in 1929 when the KPD skewed more left and more revolutionary. 

The KPD and the Nazis also like one of the commentators pointed out would very often engage in political violence against eachother in the 1930s. In the clip Destiny claims this only happens after the Nazis have already seized power not before. This is totally wrong. Political violence was very common in the Weimar republic after the depression and was most often instigated by either the communists or the national socialists and committed against each other. The communists did in some cases attack the social democrats as well but to a far far smaller extent. 

As noted the communist party was an “anti-establishment” party in the sense that it had no interest in the democratic process and was very unorganized and undisciplined. The communists believed in fighting for their political goals on the streets and not in parliament but this fighting was not targeted against (except sometimes) the sdp it was focused on fighting the national socialists. Their mutual disdain for parliamentary politics might have weakened the democracy they were both fighting against but it didn’t unify them. They were still focused on fighting each other. In fact, one of the main dividers of the communists and the SDP was their method of fighting fascism. Though just to be clear the KPD did become a very far left party during the depression and did not see the SDP as an ally rather a movement that stood against them. 

I think the perspective of anti-establishment and pro-establishment movements as another axiom to look at political movements through is a very useful one. But in this case Destiny relied it this way too much and almost totally disregarded the actual political goals of the respective movements and in addition to just being wrong on the facts. Claims like “the communists fought the nazis a little bit” are just patently false. 

As a source look at the Oxford Handbook of the Weimar republic part 3 chapter 15 it’s a pretty short read. As well as just random wikipedia knowledge that’s easy to fact check. 

This might be a little bit too ban baity but It’s really frustrating to see Destiny falling for the same kind of argumentation that’s often used against him. There are a few facts that do support his claim but If you read any reputable history textbook on the subject there just isn’t any way to come out of it agreeing with his characterization of the facts. The absolute same thing could be and is often done by communists to paint the SDP as Nazi collaborators. That case is at least as strong at the one destiny argues."

421,Destiny,"Recently, Destiny (God of debate, ameliorator of chains, lord of salience, wielder of Dan, master of Moutins, keeper of Melina) had a discussion with several orbiters regarding vaccines. In the discussion Erin aka Straighterade (a highly based orbiter) speculated about bodily autonomy in the context of the Matt Dillahunty debate and covid vaccine mandates. She further stated that there might be better ways to get people to take vaccines such as social pressure. My position would be one step further right than this in that I believe that even many localized vaccine mandates (such as those levied by a corporations) are bad for non-medical workers (such as office workers, line operators, construction workers ect.). 

The following are the propositions that I would make. 

1.) bodily autonomy has moral value. 

a.) It does not have the moral value equivalent to a human life as in the case of abortions (I am pro-first trimester but anti-second trimester abortions for context.) 

b.) It does have moral value equivalent to a certain threshold of risk to another human. An analogous situation would be driving a car. By doing this action, you inherently cause risk to other members of society. However, the autonomy to drive a car is a good enough thing to outweigh the concerns of risk to others and thus meets a threshold of risk. 

3.) Vaccines themselves are effective and based. For 99.99 percent of people, there is no good reason not to take a vaccine. I am not interested in arguments concerning their efficacy as it is irrelevant to my arguments. Similar to gun arguments, there are inherent risks we take by having rights. More people die because we own guns in the U.S. The argument is value based i.e. the ability to not be vaccinated is more important than the benefit than we get from taking it. 

a.) More people will die if more people are unvaccinated. This is true. However, as with lockdowns, I believe the freedom granted to all of society is more important than the lives lost. This is not unlimited as no freedom is unlimited. However, the threshold should be higher. 

b.) Not having mandates does not mean that people will not get vaccinated. Arguably, a lot of anti-vaccination arguments are built around the desire to not be forced to take a vaccine. Talking points against vaccinations in my opinion are built around an anti-mandate idea rather than a genuine belief that vaccines are actually bad. 

4.) Whether or not private business should have the right not to mandate vaccinations for their employees is a different question than whether or not they should in the same way your ability to say something vs. whether or not what you said is good or bad are two different questions. My position is that private businesses should not pursue this in most cases outside of the medical field. 

5.) Vaccination mandates are not as bad as lockdown mandates. The negative consequences of lockdowns is far more severe than vaccine mandates. There are essentially no costs to taking a vaccine. There are severe consequences to being locked down. I am categorically opposed to lockdowns even if they save some lives. The ability for all of society to live normally is something that I do not believe the government should have the right to take away especially for the threshold of people covid killed. Lockdowns are one of the most severe measures a government can take. I would argue basic freedom of movement is more fundamental than freedom of speech. We defend freedom of speech despite demonstrably negative consequences. Why not freedom from lockdowns? 

It seems fundamentally inconsistent, that anyone could support second or third trimester abortions, and also support vaccine mandates. If bodily autonomy is valuable enough to kill a conscious human, then by extension, it is valuable enough to prevent a covid vaccines which only creates a percentage risk to another human. It is sad that our vaccination rates are not higher. However, I believe that if bodily autonomy is morally worth enough to extend the right to an abortion up to 20-24 weeks, it is also valuable enough to extend the right to not have a covid vaccine despite the health benefits offered. 

I believe most people will take vaccines without mandates (most people in the U.S. are vaccinated), and that much of the resistance to vaccines has come as a backlash to localized and the possibility of federal mandates. There is a threshold where measures like vaccines and lockdowns (vaccines far before lockdowns) would supersede freedom. However, I do not believe covid met a high enough threshold to force vaccines or impose lockdowns. It is not necessary to be anti-vaccine to be anti-vaccine lockdown. Even if the covid vaccine was 110% effective and prevented people from getting cancer, freedom would take president in this situation. 

A final point to make, is that anti-mandate measures have had a significant negative impact. These anti-mandate measures would not exist without mandates. An example of this can be seen with the Canadian Trucker protest which did damage to Canada's economy and the well-being of residents affected by the protests.

444,Destiny,"Walter Reuther (1907-1970), labor union organizer and civil rights activist, served as President of the United Automobile Workers from 1946 to 1970. Born to Wheeling, West Virginia to socialist German immigrant parents, Reuther was raised around leftist and labor union organizing, as well as being taught opposition to racism. As a child, he and his father visited Socialist Party Presidential candidate Eugene Debs while Debs was in prison for giving a speech against WW1.

In 1927 at the age of 19 Reuther moved to Detroit and found employment at the Ford Motor Company, though he was fired in 1932 for socialist organizing. While he worked at Ford, his high skill as a mechanic allowed him to be sent do work on behalf on the company in the Soviet Union, and during his 3 year world tour he had travel through much of Europe, as well as Turkey, Iran, India, China, and Japan.

Reuther became associated with the young United Automobile Workers, becoming President of the Local 174 in west Detroit. In 1936 he led the union workers in a successful strike against the Kelsey Hayes, who supplied brake drums and wheels to Ford. Upon Reuther's insistence, women won equal pay for equal work. The speed-up of the assembly line was slowed down and the company could not fire a worker for joining the union. UAW Local 174's membership expanded from 200 before the strike to 35,000 within the next year. Over the years he was involved in organizing a number of important strikes and helped to win many gains for workers.

Though he had been a long time Socialist Party member, Reuther joined the Democratic Party in the 1930s and became a strong supporter of FDR. In 1940, Reuther responded to WW2 by promoting the idea of auto manufacturing plants converting to the production of weapons, which was later done after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He personally met Roosevelt in the White House to discuss the plan. Roosevelt would come to refer to Reuther as his ""red headed engineer"". He would later meet with Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson. After the war Reuther was elected President of the United Automobile Workers. He was also President of the Congress of Industrial Organizations between 1952 and 1955, and was involved with its merger with the AFL to form the AFL-CIO.

Reuther worked to integrate black workers into the labor unions and fought against segregation. Under his leadership the UAW won many concessions from the auto companies and gains for the workers. Reuther had become a strong anti communist, and had the communists expelled from the labor movement. Despite this, he was viewed with suspicious by many on the right, being called the ""most dangerous man in America"" by some Republicans, and was called the ""most dangerous man in Detroit"" by Governor George Romney. Survived several assassination attempts, such as in 1948 when he was shot through his kitchen window in the arm and back by a shotgun. A year later his brother also survived an assassination attempt by a man with a shotgun. The man was never caught, and FBI director Hoover expressed a complete lack of interest in investigation.

Reuther was also a strong supporter of and an activist in the Civil Rights Movement. He knew and worked with MLK, and marched with Dr. King in Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery, and Jackson. Reuther raised $160,000 for the release of protesters, and the UAW raised $75,000 for the NAACP for the Brown v. Board of Education case with the Supreme Court, as well as raised money for several other civil rights efforts. He helped to finance and organize the March on Washington, and spoke there. He was on the board of directors for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He sent letters to Johnson, who he was a major supporter of, even during the Vietnam War, urging greater civil rights measures. Reuther also lent his support and aid to Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers in California.

On May 9, 1970, Reuther and his wife died in a plane crash. At his funeral there were 3,400 people in attendance. Dr. King's wife, Coretta King, was one of the speakers. His name lives on in several awards and memorials. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter\_Reuther](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther)","Walter Reuther, long term President of the United Automobile Workers and a civil rights activist, a giant of 20th century liberalism.",1669555477,"Walter Reuther, long term President of the United Automobile Workers and a civil rights activist, a giant of 20th century liberalism. Walter Reuther (1907-1970), labor union organizer and civil rights activist, served as President of the United Automobile Workers from 1946 to 1970. Born to Wheeling, West Virginia to socialist German immigrant parents, Reuther was raised around leftist and labor union organizing, as well as being taught opposition to racism. As a child, he and his father visited Socialist Party Presidential candidate Eugene Debs while Debs was in prison for giving a speech against WW1.

In 1927 at the age of 19 Reuther moved to Detroit and found employment at the Ford Motor Company, though he was fired in 1932 for socialist organizing. While he worked at Ford, his high skill as a mechanic allowed him to be sent do work on behalf on the company in the Soviet Union, and during his 3 year world tour he had travel through much of Europe, as well as Turkey, Iran, India, China, and Japan.

Reuther became associated with the young United Automobile Workers, becoming President of the Local 174 in west Detroit. In 1936 he led the union workers in a successful strike against the Kelsey Hayes, who supplied brake drums and wheels to Ford. Upon Reuther's insistence, women won equal pay for equal work.

(I'm not Chinese, I'm not in China in case it sounds like that)

I am totally not on top of the situation and crazy hungover, but what I've seen so far is this:

There are currently a lot of student protests going on, against the party, against covid measures, in the end it all leads back to the covid policies and the impact it had on people, including a very recent fire in Urumqi killing 10 (I think), that also relates to covid measures. It's not only students protesting of course, but that's what's happening right now mostly as far as I can tell.

In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/) subreddit you can currently see a lot of videos and fotos of protests, and a lot of posts by Chinese relating to all of these events, so I basically came to share that and encourage people who are interested to have a look, should be possible to navigate the subreddit with deepl or google translate.

I'm saying it is historic because this is just not something that happens on this scale, and this bluntly. For me personally it is really special to witness and I want other people to be able to see more than the headline news article talking about protests in China, I want people to see the actual people and students fighting for their rights and the way they do it, the courage they show. It might not seem very courageous to us if a single person stands in front of their universtiy with a sign calling for political change, but in China that's a totally different story.

I don't know if this is media or politics or whatever, I will just go with politics.",Small addition to the DGG China briefings,1669532574,"Small addition to the DGG China briefings I do not plan to do more then the DGG China briefings in that format, I already feel bad for hijacking the subreddit for that, but there is some historic stuff going on in China right now and I want to share it with the people who are interested while it is going on. (I'm not Chinese, I'm not in China in case it sounds like that)

I am totally not on top of the situation and crazy hungover, but what I've seen so far is this:

There are currently a lot of student protests going on, against the party, against covid measures, in the end it all leads back to the covid policies and the impact it had on people, including a very recent fire in Urumqi killing 10 (I think), that also relates to covid measures. It's not only students protesting of course, but that's what's happening right now mostly as far as I can tell.

Destiny has made it clear that he chooses to interact with crazies because he enjoys the chaos it bring and the challenges he faces with dealing with people like that. He has the right to surround himself with these people since it is his health he is putting, usually, at a risk of higher deterioration.

I, recently found out about a certain clip of one of Destiny's ex-orbiters where he admits to committing rape. Destiny has repeatedly called this ex-orbiter of his a narcissist, mentioning how drags down and directly hurts the people who interact with him, how this person ,at times, psychotically manipulates vulnerable and impressionable people en mass and has no problem divulging personal information of others in order to get material to which to enforce his delusions with.

Yet Destiny in a recent stream admits to signing his checks, and I'm fairly certain that he hosts this persons website, where he continues to foster an audience. This person has proven himself to be harmful to everyone he interacts with, consistently trying to gaslight and manipulate anyone to believe the current narrative he peddles at the given time. I am not an advocate for deplatforming but unlike before, it is not only his health that his at risk now. By providing this rapist with a website, and an ability to steam is Destiny not enabling the aforementioned behavior? Is he not putting potential people in harms way? as it grows ever likely that he might successfully connect out to 2 particularly unpopular female streamers as well as their audience, giving him ample opportunity to gaslight more people?

I understand that this call might sound somewhat similar to Rosewrists situations, how he lost his site and was barred form ever interacting with Vaush community ever again. Yet this suggestion does not come from a place of political disagreement, or personal dislike of the person or the people he may or may not interact with in future but a genuine concern of what mind fuckery this rapist would subject people to if his audience and influence were to grow by the website Destiny has provided him. And if this person does end up putting people through mental abuse would Destiny truly share no responsibility in enabling his ability to do so?

564,Destiny,"Aba recently pushed hard making an emotionally charged argument against the normalization of obesity and the disproportionate impact on the black community which I agree with.

The problem is the point of the body positivity movement initially being ignored here. It was to make you feel comfortable with your body so you could be mentally healthy which is needed to lose the weight. Its difficult to work on yourself when you absolutely hate yourself. So on one hand we have the normalization of obesity which is wrong but then on the other we have a movement that was to fight the stigma fat people face in our society which Ultimately leads to self hate spiraling in a never ending eating disorder. 

To make it analogous,  imagine a man who is laid off , has nothing he owns , no girlfriend,  no family , lonenly , just broke living off employment at age 30.Let's say he lied to a woman saying he had a good job to get a date like the false narrative he thought was true off the woman he called a fat whale.

Do you think it's appropriate to call him a broke fuq , a bum , not a real man and so on pushing this pressure of what a man is supposed to be in our society and then say it's just jokes? 

Now imagine if we started normalizing men to be bums , to be complacent living of the government and what not.Obviously that would be wrong but you can't feel so indignant about one and not the other.To aba they are just jokes where the energy is not even remotely the same to the normalization of obesity or men being bums living off the government in my example.

And a slur need not be an immutable characteristic but merely a hateful insult to a group of people. There's slurs to insult poor white people which is not an immutable state so it naturally follows a wide spread insult of hate can be deemed a slur.

 Now I'm not saying all slurs are equal but to say "" Fat whale"" is not a slur would be disingenuous. And if aba is find with all jokes then someone should be able to cleverly joke about how diabetes disproportionately impact black people without him being indignant about it.

I’m seeking to apply for one of the recently opened orbital slots.

Here’s a small list of my qualifications.

1. I’m emotionally stable
2. I’m above the age of 24 by 9 years
3. I will never ask for special treatment
4. I value honesty above all else and willing to change my mind when faced with new info
5. I enjoy conversing, debating, and arguing and don’t take it/make it personal

A little bit about me:  
I grew up in a Hasidic community (the same sect as Ben Shapiro, so if you wanna know more about the crazy shit he can’t do on the sabbath, or the remedial religious shit he believes in I’m happy to share), with zero secular education at school, became an atheist at 20 after being introduced to science (thanks YouTube), and left as soon as I made enough money to get out.

Anyway, I’ve been wanting to chat with you for a bit now, but my self doubt seems to be equally as powerful as my ego.

P.S. Shout out to Linus Red, he is my favorite bi-monthly orbiter, I hope to chat with him as well one day.

 I wanna ask yal for advice. How yal feel about me writing my brother his eulogy even though he alive? Like I wanna really show him how much of a pathetic individual he is and dehumanize him. He believes in his life he has faced to bloodshed but I will begin an active crusade against his naked psyche and drive him to the depths of madness. I'll supply some background, but the idea is to make him confront his never ending loneness and be driven to the door of darkness. What decision he makes there is ""on him"". Just like he told me when I reached out for a reason to stay here.  


I have laid pieces throughout our lives and made sure that pivotal moments of our bond was orchestrated for weaponized use. For example, when our father died was the perfect time to plant ""word bombs"" in his brain so he may cling to what I said or ""what happened when dad died"" every time he loops. When he came home drunk and laid out cold on the stoop, I left him out to suffer before I ultimately came out just to call him pathetic trash. Recently he tried to use this as ""ammo"" against me to his own friend and the look his friend gave me was one of absolute pity. He is right where I want him.  


The man's vulnerability is obscene and pathetic. He ask for approval in ways he fails to comprehend socially. Everyone just puts up with him when he think he's the center of attention. You all know the copium. Its very easy to whittle him down, but he has my enmity. I would do myself a disservice to aim for his mask. I want to attack his very core, I want him  


u n s e e n.  


I will start by become the dominant male figure in his daughters psyche. Their psychic link is so disheveled that they both can read this and still be vulnerable to my psychic onslaught. My niece is in her teens and well beyond her years academically. The intellectual chasm between my brother and his child is a sight to behold. He is a dead beat dad. He learned from my father. As did I. So I will become the avatar of karma and wake him up to the reality where his most prized identities, this... ""father"", this ""brother"", this family man who ""changed your diapers"" and ""know more than you're going through than you know yourself"". When, in fact, his daughter tells me that she fears him an attention seeking drunkard in a loop, who only can blame her patient and empathic mom for any logical consistencies she uses to dismantle his controlling narrative. She already views me as her favorite uncle and she will participate in a non profit community art center I'm currently renovating. I don't even have to be present in her life. Simply providing an outlet for her creativity, respecting her world view and properly guiding her, not leading, as a parent should, would be enough to crush the identity he clings to whenever I begin to see that creeping red hue behind his struggling eyes.  


It is not too late for him. He is a paramedic and runs a non profit emergency response organization inherited from our father. That legacy is one not a normal man can handle and he is an altruistic, driven masculine entity. He has just seen so much death and such disregard for the sanctity of life that he is in perpetual copium. There are two kinds of people in the world who do evil, those who are hurt and confused, and those who choose it. I want to free him from his pain, even if it means obliterating this reality. I will approach him one last time as the avatar of vengeance and indignation, I will cast judgement and risk my family, reputation and life. I will meet him in worded combat one more time and ask that he humbles himself, and listen to my advice. I will tell him to take therapy and stop asking from the world, for at least a month. If he do that, I will stave off my enmity and leave him once again, in gods hands.

For the record, I read the article, and it's basically a nothingburger.  At _worst_, it suggests that Hunter might have flaunted his name around a bit where he shouldn't have (although even if this were true, it would have nothing to do with Joe Biden).  Most of the more damning information comes from one person whose story changes a bunch of different times, as well as various ""anonymous sources"" who are almost guaranteed to be the same guy.

But I think this article circulated a lot at the time and played into the ""media blackout"" narrative, so it's basically about whether you believe Greenwald on whether he was censored or not.  I think the more likely option is that nobody wanted to publish the story because it was an obvious attempt at a smear campaign with little to no substance.

I'm also not saying nobody published it, either, because plenty of people did.

I've been listening to Joe for over a decade. I've watched all of his comedy specials and have listened to at least 100 of his podcasts from start to finish.

In my opinion nobody watches his podcast if it's just Joe. Joe by himself is his stand up comedy not the podcast. 

The main reason I think this is because every time i've ever stopped listening to one of his podcasts was because the person he was talking to wasn't very entertaining or interesting. 

Joe will sometimes rescue his guests if they're struggling, but for the most part if they aren't interesting then Joe isn't enough to save the show.

761,Destiny,"The recent news about collusion between Ye, Trump and Fuentes (not Sneako, whOmegalul) has made me consider the 'JQ' discourse in  a new light, and I think we should be extremely worried about a repeat of 2016 where Trump/[insert populist of the day] rises to power off of the unaddressed concerns of the disaffected majority - but this time, with an antisemitic twist. 

Endless articles and books have been written on Trumps unexpected success in 2016, but beyond Hillary being a shit candidate, and myriad other political happenstance, white, rural America voted for Trump because they felt he was speaking about their problems in a way no one on the left was willing to address.

Trump's promises to 'bring manufacturing jobs back' and address unfair trade relations with China - while ultimately unfounded and misguided - in the minds of many Americans spoke uniquely to the very real issues they faced in daily life. Other proposals such as the Wall, and draining the Swamp were more ridiculous, but you have to understand that from their perspective, Mexican immigrants and the Deep State after 8 years of Obama were the most pressing issues of the time. 

Dems failed to address really any of these issues, instead running on their usual messaging of healthcare, tuition, and social issues. To the average trucker/grocery store worker facing layoffs due to mass automation, the choice seemed obvious. In fact, the dems still failed to address these issues (except for Yang I guess lol) in the 2020 elections, and I'm convinced that had a less republican-friendly candidate than Joe won the Primaries we would have had another 4 years of Trump. 

This brings us to today: There seems to be this rising undercurrent of antisemitic rhetoric, originally under the guise of 'George Soros globalism', but is now mostly mask-off. The left will never address these issues 'seriously' (from the eyes of the supporters), as simply refuting the idea that 'Jews control the world' without addressing the central premise that there are many Jewish people overrepresented in certain areas, is just not convincing to many of these conspiracy driven types. 

In fact this issue is unique in that it strangely transcends political boundaries. I am not Jewish, but have many people close in my life who have experience a startling amount of antisemitism from the left (typically in the form of younger, more radical people being anti-Israel, but also more recently with Ukraine). This scares me, as the only pushback against this antisemitism comes from the moderates, who have a history of not having a particularly loud voice. 

Kanye is somewhat irrelevant in this beyond being a clout-bridge, but the combination of Fuentes and Trump bodes ill to me. Trump's bid at presidency initially excited me as the prospect of splitting the Republican vote against Desantis, as well as his lackluster messaging whining about 2016, seemed like a sure-fire win for Dems. However, I see a potential now for Trump to pivot from his ineffective election denial, to a much more potent rhetoric of antisemitism. 

Although he has been pro-Israel, we know that he is not a principled political leader, and only says what he believes will serve him best in the moment. I can envision a world now where he rides this wave of populist anti-Jewish sentiment (maybe under the globalist/zionist/[[[they]]] dogwhistles) to the nomination, especially with support across the isle from insane lefties. 

Trump was underestimated in 2016, due to Dems dismissing the issues of middle-aged, rural, white men - and why wouldn't they? It's not as if these people had a voice in social media at the time - they were all banned.  The lefts immediate shutdown of any discourse related to Jews is leading to the asymmetry Destiny often points out about how unprepared leftists are to combat ideas they have censored out of their echo chambers. 

The left is not prepared for this fight, especially when it comes from across the political spectrum, and the Trump x Nick x Ye collab brings us every closer to this reality. There are a large contingent of people who feel this way about Jewish people and we need to address it head on - or we're in for another surprise on election night. 

TLDR: Trump will pivot to Nick's messaging, and ride another unseen political wave to nomination as Dems refuse to engage with the problem seriously.",Will it be 2016 all over again?

In fact, the dems still failed to address these issues (except for Yang I guess lol) in the 2020 elections, and I'm convinced that had a less republican-friendly candidate than Joe won the Primaries we would have had another 4 years of Trump. 

This brings us to today: There seems to be this rising undercurrent of antisemitic rhetoric, originally under the guise of 'George Soros globalism', but is now mostly mask-off. The left will never address these issues 'seriously' (from the eyes of the supporters), as simply refuting the idea that 'Jews control the world' without addressing the central premise that there are many Jewish people overrepresented in certain areas, is just not convincing to many of these conspiracy driven types. 

In fact this issue is unique in that it strangely transcends political boundaries. I am not Jewish, but have many people close in my life who have experience a startling amount of antisemitism from the left (typically in the form of younger, more radical people being anti-Israel, but also more recently with Ukraine). This scares me, as the only pushback against this antisemitism comes from the moderates, who have a history of not having a particularly loud voice. 

Kanye is somewhat irrelevant in this beyond being a clout-bridge, but the combination of Fuentes and Trump bodes ill to me. Trump's bid at presidency initially excited me as the prospect of splitting the Republican vote against Desantis, as well as his lackluster messaging whining about 2016, seemed like a sure-fire win for Dems. However, I see a potential now for Trump to pivot from his ineffective election denial, to a much more potent rhetoric of antisemitism. 

Although he has been pro-Israel, we know that he is not a principled political leader, and only says what he believes will serve him best in the moment. I can envision a world now where he rides this wave of populist anti-Jewish sentiment (maybe under the globalist/zionist/[[[they]]] dogwhistles) to the nomination, especially with support across the isle from insane lefties. 

Trump was underestimated in 2016, due to Dems dismissing the issues of middle-aged, rural, white men - and why wouldn't they? It's not as if these people had a voice in social media at the time - they were all banned.  The lefts immediate shutdown of any discourse related to Jews is leading to the asymmetry Destiny often points out about how unprepared leftists are to combat ideas they have censored out of their echo chambers. 

The left is not prepared for this fight, especially when it comes from across the political spectrum, and the Trump x Nick x Ye collab brings us every closer to this reality. There are a large contingent of people who feel this way about Jewish people and we need to address it head on - or we're in for another surprise on election night. 

TLDR: Trump will pivot to Nick's messaging, and ride another unseen political wave to nomination as Dems refuse to engage with the problem seriously."

I really don't understand how he can even be seriously debated. Anti-semitism aside, he says the most flagrantly contrived and historically inaccurate crap imaginable and then goes ""There's a little redpill for you!"" as if taking enormous pride in just having dropped some major truth bomb that is being concealed from the public.

Nick brings up how 'The Jews' ( several Jewish-American organizations, a few of which initially opposed or abstain in order to avoid more tension until they realized it isn't helping ) declared war on Germany, referring to well-known [1933 Anti-Nazi boycotts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933_anti-Nazi_boycott) as soon as Hitler was elected chancellor 'before anything even happened' and because they 'hated him for being a christian nationalist'. 

As the wiki article states, apparently Hitler's authoring of Mein Kampf in which he dehumanizes and calls for the destruction of Jewry, even saying he wishes they all died from the type of poison gas used in WW1, and the formation of the Brownshirts ( SA ) in the 1920's who terrorizes and lynched Jews throughout Germany, and of course the Nazi's party encouragement of boycotting all things Jewish from the moment their ideology was first coined, all count as 'nothing happening' until the reaction of Jewish organizations to Hitler's appointment as the straw that broke the camel's back.

Jews automatically hated him for being a nationalist, seeing as how none of the [Jewish soldiers who fought in the Wehrmacht during WW1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Jewish_military_personnel_of_World_War_I), including Hitler's [own commanding officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Gutmann) whom he actually allowed to leave Nazi Germany with his pension under a Gestapo escort in recognition of their past history, could've possibly been nationalists themselves. And since there weren't any other [Nationalist, Christian, and Christian Nationalist parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_political_parties) in the Weimar Republic, including Hindeburg's party, which mysteriously never got boycotted by any Jews.

They did all get shut down by the Nazis as soon as they rose to power though. In fact, the Nazi party then also proceeded to persecute none other than Nick's favorite institution - [The Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_persecution_of_the_Catholic_Church_in_Germany), since their vision often misaligned and the Nazis also wanted exclusive control. 

How can someone be such a two-faced worm willing to peddle the most brazen lies imaginable, including covering for those who *actually* attacked ""his faith"", just to propagandize against Jews a little bit more? You know I'm starting to think Nick would probably be clapping and cheering for the Nazi party as they were fighting with the Catholic Church, almost as if he was never on the Catholic side at all.

770,Destiny,"A lot of the things Devin and Destiny said were good solid investment advice.

I really like the ""stay in your lane"" take from Devin. There are a lot of different ways you can invest your money, but the best way is always the way you actually understand. There are a few quotes I remember from studying finance years ago.. the first one - which relates to this is ""If I look at an investment prospectus and I can't figure out how they're making money within 5 minutes, I don't invest."" This is agreat rule of thumb to keep you from investing in things you don't understand - and it will help keep you out of convoluted ponzi schemes that seem prolific in the crypto space. 

The majority of investors should stick to ETFs. Destiny gave this piece of advice years ago.. and it still holds true today (I believe I remember a video where he was giving Ice Poseidon advice, and Ice Poseidon was talking about buying property and Destiny was warning him about all the costs involved in owning property and advising an ETF instead). This is really solid advice. Consider for a moment, the hundreds - thousands of highly trained, highly paid, highly sophisticated investors on wallstreet, managing billions - even trillions of dollars in wealth on behalf of their clients. You need to realise that it takes an incredible amount of hubris to think that you can beat these guys at their own game. Do you really think that because you watch a youtube video about how wallstreet has gotten a stock price wrong, you now have the ability to outplay these guys? You don't. 

I'm not saying wall street is perfect, but they are at the forefront of what is possible in the stockmarket space. There are some investors that are exceptional - warren buffet for example, but look back at what actually made Wareen Buffet rich. He didn't just pick the right stocks and get rich off passive income.. he went into struggling businesses, saw potential, bought them out and actually went in andturned them around. That's what made him his wealth. Can you do that?

Another quote I rmeember from my university days. ""If my taxi driver starts talking about a stock, I know it's time to get out."" Think Tesla, think Bitcoin.. these have become household names, and they are incredibly risky investments.

It's true that all investments come with some risk - if there's no risk it's not investment, it's arbitrage. It's important to manage your risk profile. Younger people can generally handle more risk - since your gains will average out over the ""long term"".. but older people who likely will need to turn their investments into money to sustain themselvesi n their old age should stick to low risk investments - utilities stocks, bonds or things like longevity insurance (a growing annuity tied to inflation) are good for older people. That said, I wouldn't recommend cryptocurrency as an investment even for young individuals, the risk is just too great. 

Honestly I wouldn't even call cryptocurrency an investment, it's pure speculation - a ponzi scheme. I actually agree with everything Destiny said about it in this video. It is funny how it started off as this rebellion against banks and fiat currency, but as cryptocurrency matures people are realising more and more why our current financial system works as it does. It went from people saying cryptocurrency being good because the government can't regulate it, to saying cryptocurrency will finally be good once the government adopts and regulates it. The irony. 

Crypto rant aside.. there were a couple of things I took issue with in the video. Firstly I don't think Destiny should really have said that buying a hosue to live in is not investing. It is. But he's right that you're not ""Getting into real estate"" as most people would understand it. Maybe that's just a nitpick.. but as a portion of networth, the family home is often the largest part of a families portfolio.. and while it doesn't generate visible cashflow in - and has maintenance costs etc.. you are saving on any rental payments you would make in future. 

That said I don't even think buying a house is for everyone. Not just because a lot of people can't afford it these days.. but there are situations where renting can be better. For one, if you don't plan on living in the house for a long time, renting will often be better. The lawyers fees, real estate agent fees etc involved in buying and selling houses is quite significant, so if you're buying and sellign houses frequently you're going to get torn to shreds by that. 

Here's the biggest reason for buying a house however. A lot of people struggle to have the self control to save money. I'm not talkign about the people on minimum wage and high rent who are trapped in poverty - I feel for you.. but there are people with well paying jobs who go out drinking every weekend, buy fancy cards and have car payments to deal with etc etc, and end up having their entire paycheck gone each week regardless.  If you are one of these people and you don't have the self control to save, then it doesn't matter what you want to invest in - you're just not going to have any money to invest and you'll never get rich.

For these people, owning a house and having a mortgage payment that automatically comes out of their account - which they can't spend, essentially forces them to save. 

Another argument for buying a house - a few years ago when crypto was at a peak, a friend of mine told me he was worried about what it could mean if cryptocurrency took over, since he didn't have any. But he'd jsut bought a house. What I pointed out was, if fiat currency does crash to 0 against cryptocurrency as the loudest cryptobros like to say - or did at the time, then actually that would be great for him. Why? Because in terms of fiat currency he had negative exposure. Sure he had some cash i nthe bank.. but hsi mortgage was in fiat, so essentially he had a net negative balance of fiat currency. In which case if it crashed to 0, sure he'd lose all the cash in the bank - or all the value of it, but his mortgage would also become worthless too, while he wouldstill have his house, and whether bitcoin or dollars are used as the main currency a house is still worth a house. - Obviously I don't actually see fiat dropping to 0 against bitcoin.

now what really annoyed me about the video: Dan. Like god damnit Dan, you go ahead and buy your office space or whatever, if you want to speculate on it go for it. But you DO NOT KNOW if demand for office space will rise or fall in the future. That is pure speculation and you should not be offering that as investment advice to anyone. 

A little about me: Since I'm making some takes on investment here I should give some background. First of all, I'm not a millionaire or billionaire. I have not gotten rich off investments, but I am 30 and I own a house and a small portfolio of stocks. I have a Bachelors degree in Finance and I had a GradDip in Information Science. These two qualifications give me some confidence when I'm talking about cryptocurrency in particular - although it was never part of the curriculum, I have the background knowledge to a) understand current financial systems and why they work the way they do, and 2) the tech literacy to understand how cryptocurrency and blockchai nactually work -, and I have done much of my own research o nthe topic of cryptocurrency as I find it very interesting, espite having no interest in it as an investment.","Some thoughts on the ""Crypto crash and unpopular opinion"" video.",1669388442,"Some thoughts on the ""Crypto crash and unpopular opinion"" video.

827,Destiny,"He said on today's stream that if you're a man and don't care if your girlfriend fucks a girl but you care if it's a guy stems from insecurity. That doesn't feel right at all. 

A man can inseminate your girl and get her pregnant. In terms of evolution, what disadvantage does the man face if the woman sleeps with other women? They can both take care of his child together; a woman will not abandon her child because she had sex with another woman. 

If a woman sleeps with another man, it seems unfathomable/unreasonable for the man not to care because the risk for the man is astronomical in terms of pregnancy and fidelity. If ""insecurity"" about her getting pregnant is what Destiny means, then sure, but that can only happen if she sleeps with a man. My understanding is that's not how Destiny uses insecurity, he talks about dick size or what the other man can provide that you can't. I'm sure that could be true for some men, or even most men, but why use that as the justification instead of the more reasonable take about pregnancy and men having evolved to prefer purity for the reasons mentioned above?

I feel like because Destiny is an anomaly in this regard, he has a blind spot in these types of discussions. He should do research on these topics like he does in other topics to be better informed/armed when having these discussions which will inevitably come up for many years to come on his stream or future interviews/collabs.

First, insinuating amouranth was overselling the abuse she received because she continues to do titty streams seems like a reach. Especially since that’s what she’s know for. And even still, she’s done more content and other shit on stream recently compared to before.

Second, calling (redacted) a rapist. I don’t want to dive too far because of the ban on that topic. But it seems a bit much, though I can understand why given the circumstances.

Lastly, insinuating Nick is gay. There doesn’t seem to be any hard evidence here, just speculation on some admittedly weird pictures.

872,Destiny,"So I’m a international working in the US. Recently i have been trying to buy a car recently (subaru crosstrek manual) which are pretty rare.

I found this car online and setup an appointment to test drive that evening( in 3 hours from setting up appointment). When i got to the dealership i met an agent they said they will bring car for me to test drive. Made me wait for a little bit and the agent returned and said i unfortunately can’t test drive. So i asked did they sell it? They said yes. Said sorry i had to drive out and i left.

After coming home i felt something was off with that agent because they usually try to sell you some other car they have at the dealership. I noticed the car was still listed the next day so i made my roommate apply for it and they gave him a new appointment for the same car. I still gave them benefit of doubt and wanted to be sure that they weren’t discriminating so i made a white friend call them and confirm they had the car and they gave him an appointment. 

I still wanted to be sure so i texted the agent that i saw the car online if it was still available. They told me it was sold in kinda rude way. 

What do you guys think about this situation. Was i discriminated against? I have my friends appointment tomorrow to go check out the car. Is it right for me to still buy this car if i like it? Should I call them out for this? I can afford this car and have a credit score of around 700. For context I’m south asian brown skinned and have an accent but i think i speak decent english.

881,Destiny,"On stream he mentioned that most guys are probably ok with their girl getting with another girl, but would freak out if they get with a guy. He said this is mostly due to insecurity. I’m paraphrasing but I think this is a fair representation of his thoughts.

I think it’s a bit of an oversimplification. If your girl is getting dicked down by a girl with a strap on, I think many guys will feel some type of way. Conversely, if their girl is pegging another dude, they probably wouldn’t have as strong of a reaction.

I believe, in most relationships, men take a more dominant role in the bedroom. That’s why I think guys don’t mind if their girl got with a girl if she took on a dominant role and would probably come around to their girl getting with a dude if she took on a dominant role.

I agree with destiny, guys will tend to compare themselves with the other partner of their girl if it’s a guy, but i disagree with the why. If you’re offering your girl something in the bedroom and she is looking for similar things in other bedrooms then it’s inevitable to compare, but if she’s look for something different then you don’t really feel the need to compare.

That’s why I don’t agree with his take about guys not feeling some type of way if their girl gets with another girl. If she is looking for something similar in that bedroom to what you provide her then you will start making comparisons too. Depending on your bedroom dynamics, if you ”dominate“ your girl in the bedroom, then you don’t want her to be “dominated” by other guys or girls. Also, you would probably be ok with her “dominating” girls and eventually guys too.

891,Destiny,"On stream today, Destiny said he could flesh out why being vegan leads to problems. Some of which were, 

1. If animals feeling pain is bad then that means there are bad things happening in nature all the time. 
2. Our biology is suited for eating animals.
3. Animals are not held to the same ethical standard as humans.
4. Animals can kill you if they wanted to.

I'll be using this definition of Veganism; ""*Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to  exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation  of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and  by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free  alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In  dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products  derived wholly or partly from animals*."" 	- Vegan society

I'll also be assuming you have the arbitrary axiom of ""suffering is bad"".

To address the first point, the purpose of being Vegan is to reduce suffering you might cause in a reasonable way. Whether or not a lion is eating a gazelle's balls has nothing to do with whether I reach to grab the vegan cheese or dairy cheese. I can accept that animals are hurting one another because flying to Africa to stop lions would be impracticable.

   Addressing the second point, this claim isn't something that needs to be debated because one of two things are true. We either need animal products to survive and/or to be healthy or we don't. Unless you think you do need animals then it doesn't matter what our biology is ""suited"" for. Just because I have suitable prostate to be massaged doesn't mean I should massaged it. 

   Third point, If you accept that a baby doesn't have moral agency then surely animals don't. If you do think babies should be put on trial then you are sending them to amos yee in jail. Idk if that's a good thing.

   Last point, I think it's funny when carnist bring this point up. WE DON'T EAT CARNIVORES. A cow will not kill you to eat you. We eat herbivores. However, being good faith I will grant you that I would kill a bear or lion if it attacked me. Might as well eat it if it did. Most people here probably accept self defense as an axiom. One side point is the morality of, ""if I put something or someone in a situation where they would do bad I can preemptively enact retribution because of it"" is problematic for hopefully self evident reasons.

I can accept that animals are hurting one another because flying to Africa to stop lions would be impracticable.

   Addressing the second point, this claim isn't something that needs to be debated because one of two things are true. We either need animal products to survive and/or to be healthy or we don't. Unless you think you do need animals then it doesn't matter what our biology is ""suited"" for. Just because I have suitable prostate to be massaged doesn't mean I should massaged it. 

   Third point, If you accept that a baby doesn't have moral agency then surely animals don't. If you do think babies should be put on trial then you are sending them to amos yee in jail. Idk if that's a good thing.

   Last point, I think it's funny when carnist bring this point up. WE DON'T EAT CARNIVORES. A cow will not kill you to eat you. We eat herbivores. However, being good faith I will grant you that I would kill a bear or lion if it attacked me. Might as well eat it if it did. Most people here probably accept self defense as an axiom. One side point is the morality of, ""if I put something or someone in a situation where they would do bad I can preemptively enact retribution because of it"" is problematic for hopefully self evident reasons. Minority report on steroids.  

In conclusion to the 2 ppl that read this. You more faded than a hoe lil bro."

898,Destiny,"I have a friend who says he's pansexual. He mostly dates women, but also dates non binary people and transmen who are early in transition.

Like, you look at pictures of people he dates who don't identify as women, and all of them are very fem-presenting. All of the non-binary people he dates are afab, and the transmen are super-super early in transition.

I even asked him if he can imagine getting back together with one of his transmen partners in 5 years, when they've been on testosterone for longer and present more masculine, and he was like, ""I'm not sure.""

My opinion is that this guy is just straight, and if you want to call him pan, than that's just being pedantic and overly technical. There's no world in which this person can be considered attracted to non-women, other than on a very technical level.

This is coming from a person who thinks that transmen are men, and non-binary people are valid btw. I'm not sure how those two beliefs coexist in my head, maybe that's what I'm trying to figure out.

922,Destiny,"He has modes. 
Very clear, distinct modes in conversations. This is not an issue, its probably a good thing. Here are the modes, generally; 

Mr Debater: he is honestly engaging, in a one on one conversation, not communicating with chat, going point by point, taking notes. 
(Example: Any non Haz Russia conversation, Change My Mknd convos,  disagreements about language usage a few months ago)

Explainer/ Intrepter: talking through someones positions, light if any pushback, explicitly referencing the audience, helping people to formulate positions, asking for a stance to be taken and defended. 
(Example: L** or Mr****, early Ana talks, Ukrainian Ana talks)

Godstiny: less charitable, conversations that have been done to death, talking points repeated, more insulting. (Example: conversative chatter dunking)

Bipolarstiny: Casual, laughing conversation, unserious. But any disagreement is jumped upon aggressively. 
(Example: Dan convos, Erudite talking about fat loss vs muscle growth, any Lauren Southern convo)
In this mode people are pressed for examples (Dan prince example) in a way that people are not pressed in actual disagreements. 

The Facilitator: Allowing conversation to happen, stepping in to regulate when necessary, isn't actively following the conversation if asked for input will need caught up. 
(Example: Ana-Fenty convo, various Aba-Dan talks)

Its annoying that these modes exist, not because any of them are bad per-say, but its inconsistent. When asked about how he engages with people, the criticisms usually are pointing at anything but Mr Debater, but Destiny will say he is ""literally the best faith person to have this discussion with, I'm listening, I'm taking notes, if I don't understand you no one will"". That is fair, for when he's actually engaged. But he's not always.

It's especially annoying whenever the same situation/ topic is ""covered"" in two different conversation styles. Mr**** rape explanation, when talking to Supreme he goes from memeing to hardcore disagreeing, seemingly unable to understand how Supreme could disagree, Bipolarstiny, when Explainer/ Intrepter could've handled the conversation far better.

This goes back to Chaeiry's misogyny-esque criticism about the homophobic TikTok girl convo. A role was picked that wasn't disagreeable and so no real discussion happend. The same for viewer call-ins, there's no way of telling if a dicussion will be taken seriously (not that they all should be, and not that they at all deserve to be most of the time).

974,Destiny,"I often see Americans complaining how they have to pay for college while most of Europe (Germany, France, Spain, Scandinavian countries etc.) doesn't. While this is a fair point, there is one thing you should keep in mind.

School is entirely structured in Europe than it is in the USA. Take Germany as an example. At the early age of 10-11 children are divided between several options for secondary school, according to their school results. Meaning only the good students get enrolled in ""Gymnasium"" which is the equivalent of UK's Grammar School. In some countries this starts later. Croatia at 14, Scandinavian Countries at 16 (I believe). Once you complete this you take the final exams and can enroll to college.

So while it's true that we have free education, not everyone gets it. Usually it's those that start getting good  grades from an early age and keep that up. This has been sometimes critized by media, because  it disfavors children from poorer backrounds who don't have the opportunities to apply themselves as much as students from middle/higher income families. 

Secondary, the college life which exists in America is almost non existant in Europe. If you're an good athlete in school, good for you.                                                                                                                             
But that doesn't get you to college; as sports is almost completely isolated from university (in comparison to America). Most people also attend the college of the city they live in or live closely to. That means, they are probably going to live the majority of their college life with their parents. Dorms are very limited, usually only international students get them. There are no Fraternity/Sororities, no extremely big college campuses. When you are finished with lectures, you just go home.  

Pecentage wise, Germany has 2.95 million students right now (about 3,54% of their population). In the USA it's about 20 million (about 6% of their population). Atleast according to this [https://www.statista.com/statistics/183995/us-college-enrollment-and-projections-in-public-and-private-institutions/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183995/us-college-enrollment-and-projections-in-public-and-private-institutions/)

&amp;#x200B;

So to keep in mind, if we would apply the same system in America, as it's practised in most of Europe, the number of U.S students would probably go down. The majority of US students would probably come from atleast middle class families or families that highly value education. There would be no athletes that go to University just because they are good at sport even though they're not so good at school.                                
Judging America by their income by race and social class, this would probably mean that the big big majority of US students would just be White and Asian students; even at a more disproportionate rate than it's right now.",Europe and free education,1669283326,"Europe and free education I often see Americans complaining how they have to pay for college while most of Europe (Germany, France, Spain, Scandinavian countries etc.) doesn't.

Dorms are very limited, usually only international students get them. There are no Fraternity/Sororities, no extremely big college campuses. When you are finished with lectures, you just go home.  

Pecentage wise, Germany has 2.95 million students right now (about 3,54% of their population). In the USA it's about 20 million (about 6% of their population). Atleast according to this [https://www.statista.com/statistics/183995/us-college-enrollment-and-projections-in-public-and-private-institutions/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183995/us-college-enrollment-and-projections-in-public-and-private-institutions/)

&amp;#x200B;

So to keep in mind, if we would apply the same system in America, as it's practised in most of Europe, the number of U.S students would probably go down. The majority of US students would probably come from atleast middle class families or families that highly value education. There would be no athletes that go to University just because they are good at sport even though they're not so good at school.                                
Judging America by their income by race and social class, this would probably mean that the big big majority of US students would just be White and Asian students; even at a more disproportionate rate than it's right now."

I think American football is an extremely athletic game. It's really amazing to see all those insane athletes run across the field and be so violent. 

The game is high scoring too so that's always fun.

There's a lot of team play which is fun to watch. And on top of that there are opportunities for individuals to shine.

(Like baseball and cricket are team based sports but there's not a lot of interplay there. They just kinda... stand at their spots and catch the ball if it comes their way. At a time there's essentially only three players at play. One throwing the ball. One hitting the ball. One fielding it)

But it stops way too much. Mkes it harder to enjoy. And the players huddle around the ball pretty often it's really hard to tell who's who and what's going on until after. When you get to see it from multiple angles. Hockey does that too. They all huddle around thr ball so much. (Which makes sense for the sport, but not fun for someone at home watching on the tele)

Football/soccer is a much more fun game to watch. The players are incredibly athletic there as well. (I keep saying athletic players because that's fun to watch. There are sports like cricket where the players with pot bellies can win. I think that's stupid)

Lots of teamplay involved. Individuals shine here too. 

Not a lot of stopping. But the games can feel uneventful when it ends in a low scoring game. I've seen people argue against tjis point saying ""its about the drama and tension""

Yea well there needs to be a conclusion to that tension. A tennis rally can go on for 10 minutes but there has to be a conclusion.

These people also misrepresent this argument by sahing ""haha big number better small number me no like"". But then get excited when spain scores 7 goals. Higher scores are obviously more exciting. More eventful. 

Tennis games are also arguably low scores, if you only count individual matches and not sets. But there's a  conclusion to all the back and forth at the end. Which makes it fun to watch.

6,Destiny,"I've seen a lot of conservatives on here arguing in defense of Counterpoints (and getting shit on) but I don't think I've seen a serious critique of Counterpoint's position (that conservatives can take seriously)

I'm not going to talk about the twitter files. If you want to know where I stand, they are good, insofar as they offer transparency into a social media platform that we haven't seen before (outside of a courtroom) but generally, I don't think anything substantial has been revealed, and I think Elon's sole purpose for releasing them in the way that he has is to make twitter relevant, and popular with conservatives (i.e. to establish a base, pander to that base, and milk them for as much money and attention as he can).

Destiny's problem in the debate is that he wants to argue one position: that conservatives think twitter shadowbanned people purely based on their political party, which is demonstrably **false,** but he wants Counterpoints to argue this position, even though Counterpoints doesn't want to argue that (even though counterpoints is on Destiny's stream, so he probably should)

Counterpoints (connor?) wants to argue that twitter suppressed political topics which just so happened to be aligned with the political interests of conservatives, OuTsIdE oF tHe OvErToN wInDoW, **(this is true, by the way)**, but their inconsistency with how they moderated discourse on the platform is evident of a nefarious political bias to ensure that conservatives lost elections **(which is false.)**

 First of all, Connor's position is hypocritical, when you have elon musk tweeting about voting for republicans in the midterms - BUT he acknowledges this, when he says that now the shoe is on the other foot, or whatever, and now democrats are going to know how it felt to be a conservative on twitter for the last 10 years. However, and secondly, we know connor is simply incorrect because what was already supposed to be a red wave during the midterms, even with the explicit endorsement of one of earth's most famous/popular grifters (Elon) on a ""free speech absolutist"" twitter turned into a total wash, and the outcome for republican's wasn't even slightly less good, it was plain terrible. 

But lets address Connor's arguments:

&amp;#x200B;

1. twitter suppressed political topics which happen to be aligned with conservative talking points

This is true. We know it is. When Destiny and Connor disagree on whether it was known or not, I think Destiny makes a mistake. Sure, everyone ""knew"" but that belief wasn't justified until it was released through the twitter files, so now we do know, because there is clear proof. 

HOWEVER, what is the content of those political topics? 9/11 conspiracies? JFK being assassinated by his secret service agents? No? Oh, we are actually talking about covid denial, fraudulent election claims, and Qanon stuff). The first one supported the objectively false claims that resulted in people literally dying (herman cain award) because of misinformation. The second one resulted in people literally dying on Capitol Hill whether from getting shot, or stampled on, and this isn't even to \*mention\* the members of the capitol police who fucking killed themselves afterwards (Connor wants to jerk off the police until it comes to those defending the capitol). The third one led to a bunch of stuff, but generally was paired with the first two and as I said, resulted in pretty terrible outcomes which could have otherwise been avoided. 

If twitter suppressed those topics, all of which were objectively false, and also dangerous, that is their first amendment prerogative to do so, and if it just so happened to be conservatives peddling those idiotic positions, those people deserved to be suppressed. I don't see what is so controversial about that statement. They can go to facebook, or instagram, or wherever else, but I don't think there is anything inherently bad about shadowbanning people for those topics.

Now, one point I saw which some people made is that twitter allows for all kinds of other discourse which has similar content (socialist revolution, the Supreme leader of iran calling for the destruction of israel, etc.) but I would argue these are substantially different because the outcomes do not substantiate in real life to even a fraction of a degree that  covid denial, election fraud, and qanon have. We all know socialists on twitter are all talk, and also the supreme leader of iran doesn't have the same platform as Donald Trump. Do I support what he's saying? no. Do I support banning trump? eh, not really. Can Donald trump start his own social media company or go on national television whenever he wants? yes. Can the leader of Iran do the same? No. So I don't think twitter should treat them equally. 

If you know what the first amendment actually guarantees, you would know that Twitter, as far as I know, is not owned by the government, so it can do whatever the hell it wants, INCLUDING selling the company (or forcing the purchase due to his stupidity) to Elon Musk, so it can be your conservative heaven, which Donald probably isn't too crazy about, considering that he started truth social. And to complain about what twitter was doing, is frankly ridiculous if you want me to take you seriously as a ""center right"" pundit like Connor, when your party is responsible for the most fucking insane positions held popularly in modern politics. 

And this is  my problem with Counterpoints, and why he caught a lot of (deserved, in my opinion) shit on destiny's stream. You cannot be a ""center-right"" conservative, throwing tantrums when people don't take you seriously, if you are going to defend the most asinine and dangerous positions your party has. You can't be anti big tech because of their ""liberal bias"" and then suck on daddy Elon's nuts when he panders so hard to your party. **You can't accuse a PRIVATE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY of** **ELECTION INTERFERENCE because of their internal moderation policy even if you think it is unfair, especially considering what happened during the midterms.** 

# And you definitely, 1000%, swearing on the grave of Ronald H Reagan, can NOT:

# Come up with a conspiracy theory, with zero supporting evidence, citing a personal trauma you experienced, in order to demand that people respect your position, and then get pissy when people point out how insane you are acting.

Because if you want people to take your political position seriously as being ""center-right"" (looking at you, Freeza meme poster) and respectfully discuss the policies you claim to care about, you need to call out all the bullshit extremism that is mainstream in your party when you see it. And the last thing you should ever do, is come up with your own idiotic conspiracy claiming that:

*  IF the american people had seen hunter biden's meaty cock, 
* THEN they wouldn't have elected Brandon president, 
* BUT because the intelligence officials at the FBI and pentagon didn't support Trump, 
* SO They therefore used twitter to suppress the secret story of hunter biden's laptop that literally every single person in the country was talking about (just go to the fucking new york post website if you want to see it so bad) on the TV, on the radio, on infowars, on 4chan, on truth social, on facebook, or wherever else,
* AND AS A RESULT Donald Trump lost the election, which constitutes election interference equivalent to what happened in 2016.

In 2016, a foreign nation used their internet agents to sway the political direction of our country through facebook and other social media sites to advance their political interests through deception and misinformation. In 2020, a private company internally decided that some of you motherfuckers are batshit crazy and suppressed those batshit crazy discussions because they resulted in death, insurrection, racism, and general degeneration of political discourse. 

And one more thing. You can't say ""Oh, I'm on twitch, why are you taking what I'm saying so seriously,"" and then turn around and throw the most pathetic tantrum i've ever seen, because you felt it was appropriate to say ""I had people die in my arms"" as a support to this argument/conspiracy you claim is just a meme when it is very clearly not. 

People don't take conservatives seriously and they don't vote for conservatives because right now, 2/3rds of the party believe the election was stolen (it wasn't), that Fauci is a criminal and Covid was just a flu (he's no more a criminal than old donny, and covid is serious), or that the vaccine will make you a 5g antennae (it won't), and some (but not a majority) think that jews are evil. And as a consequence of the lack of pushback from people who claim to be ""center right,"" people have died needlessly, and the fundamental principle of our country - democracy, is in serious danger. That's why you guys got shit on in the midterms, not because twitter didn't let you see hunter biden's dick.",Here's the problem with Counterpoints (Welcome to any reasonable critique from the other side),1671064218,"Here's the problem with Counterpoints (Welcome to any reasonable critique from the other side) I've seen a lot of conservatives on here arguing in defense of Counterpoints (and getting shit on) but I don't think I've seen a serious critique of Counterpoint's position (that conservatives can take seriously)

I'm not going to talk about the twitter files. If you want to know where I stand, they are good, insofar as they offer transparency into a social media platform that we haven't seen before (outside of a courtroom) but generally, I don't think anything substantial has been revealed, and I think Elon's sole purpose for releasing them in the way that he has is to make twitter relevant, and popular with conservatives (i.e. to establish a base, pander to that base, and milk them for as much money and attention as he can).

Destiny's problem in the debate is that he wants to argue one position: that conservatives think twitter shadowbanned people purely based on their political party, which is demonstrably **false,** but he wants Counterpoints to argue this position, even though Counterpoints doesn't want to argue that (even though counterpoints is on Destiny's stream, so he probably should)

Counterpoints (connor?) wants to argue that twitter suppressed political topics which just so happened to be aligned with the political interests of conservatives, OuTsIdE oF tHe OvErToN wInDoW, **(this is true, by the way)**, but their inconsistency with how they moderated discourse on the platform is evident of a nefarious political bias to ensure that conservatives lost elections **(which is false.)**

 First of all, Connor's position is hypocritical, when you have elon musk tweeting about voting for republicans in the midterms - BUT he acknowledges this, when he says that now the shoe is on the other foot, or whatever, and now democrats are going to know how it felt to be a conservative on twitter for the last 10 years. However, and secondly, we know connor is simply incorrect because what was already supposed to be a red wave during the midterms, even with the explicit endorsement of one of earth's most famous/popular grifters (Elon) on a ""free speech absolutist"" twitter turned into a total wash, and the outcome for republican's wasn't even slightly less good, it was plain terrible. 

But lets address Connor's arguments:

&amp;#x200B;

1. twitter suppressed political topics which happen to be aligned with conservative talking points

This is true. We know it is. When Destiny and Connor disagree on whether it was known or not, I think Destiny makes a mistake. Sure, everyone ""knew"" but that belief wasn't justified until it was released through the twitter files, so now we do know, because there is clear proof. 

HOWEVER, what is the content of those political topics? 9/11 conspiracies? JFK being assassinated by his secret service agents? No? Oh, we are actually talking about covid denial, fraudulent election claims, and Qanon stuff). The first one supported the objectively false claims that resulted in people literally dying (herman cain award) because of misinformation. The second one resulted in people literally dying on Capitol Hill whether from getting shot, or stampled on, and this isn't even to \*mention\* the members of the capitol police who fucking killed themselves afterwards (Connor wants to jerk off the police until it comes to those defending the capitol). The third one led to a bunch of stuff, but generally was paired with the first two and as I said, resulted in pretty terrible outcomes which could have otherwise been avoided. 

If twitter suppressed those topics, all of which were objectively false, and also dangerous, that is their first amendment prerogative to do so, and if it just so happened to be conservatives peddling those idiotic positions, those people deserved to be suppressed. I don't see what is so controversial about that statement. They can go to facebook, or instagram, or wherever else, but I don't think there is anything inherently bad about shadowbanning people for those topics.

Now, one point I saw which some people made is that twitter allows for all kinds of other discourse which has similar content (socialist revolution, the Supreme leader of iran calling for the destruction of israel, etc.) but I would argue these are substantially different because the outcomes do not substantiate in real life to even a fraction of a degree that  covid denial, election fraud, and qanon have. We all know socialists on twitter are all talk, and also the supreme leader of iran doesn't have the same platform as Donald Trump. Do I support what he's saying? no. Do I support banning trump? eh, not really. Can Donald trump start his own social media company or go on national television whenever he wants? yes. Can the leader of Iran do the same? No. So I don't think twitter should treat them equally. 

If you know what the first amendment actually guarantees, you would know that Twitter, as far as I know, is not owned by the government, so it can do whatever the hell it wants, INCLUDING selling the company (or forcing the purchase due to his stupidity) to Elon Musk, so it can be your conservative heaven, which Donald probably isn't too crazy about, considering that he started truth social. And to complain about what twitter was doing, is frankly ridiculous if you want me to take you seriously as a ""center right"" pundit like Connor, when your party is responsible for the most fucking insane positions held popularly in modern politics. 

And this is  my problem with Counterpoints, and why he caught a lot of (deserved, in my opinion) shit on destiny's stream. You cannot be a ""center-right"" conservative, throwing tantrums when people don't take you seriously, if you are going to defend the most asinine and dangerous positions your party has. You can't be anti big tech because of their ""liberal bias"" and then suck on daddy Elon's nuts when he panders so hard to your party. **You can't accuse a PRIVATE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY of** **ELECTION INTERFERENCE because of their internal moderation policy even if you think it is unfair, especially considering what happened during the midterms.** 

# And you definitely, 1000%, swearing on the grave of Ronald H Reagan, can NOT:

# Come up with a conspiracy theory, with zero supporting evidence, citing a personal trauma you experienced, in order to demand that people respect your position, and then get pissy when people point out how insane you are acting.

Because if you want people to take your political position seriously as being ""center-right"" (looking at you, Freeza meme poster) and respectfully discuss the policies you claim to care about, you need to call out all the bullshit extremism that is mainstream in your party when you see it. And the last thing you should ever do, is come up with your own idiotic conspiracy claiming that:

*  IF the american people had seen hunter biden's meaty cock, 
* THEN they wouldn't have elected Brandon president, 
* BUT because the intelligence officials at the FBI and pentagon didn't support Trump, 
* SO They therefore used twitter to suppress the secret story of hunter biden's laptop that literally every single person in the country was talking about (just go to the fucking new york post website if you want to see it so bad) on the TV, on the radio, on infowars, on 4chan, on truth social, on facebook, or wherever else,
* AND AS A RESULT Donald Trump lost the election, which constitutes election interference equivalent to what happened in 2016.

In 2016, a foreign nation used their internet agents to sway the political direction of our country through facebook and other social media sites to advance their political interests through deception and misinformation. In 2020, a private company internally decided that some of you motherfuckers are batshit crazy and suppressed those batshit crazy discussions because they resulted in death, insurrection, racism, and general degeneration of political discourse. 

And one more thing. You can't say ""Oh, I'm on twitch, why are you taking what I'm saying so seriously,"" and then turn around and throw the most pathetic tantrum i've ever seen, because you felt it was appropriate to say ""I had people die in my arms"" as a support to this argument/conspiracy you claim is just a meme when it is very clearly not. 

People don't take conservatives seriously and they don't vote for conservatives because right now, 2/3rds of the party believe the election was stolen (it wasn't), that Fauci is a criminal and Covid was just a flu (he's no more a criminal than old donny, and covid is serious), or that the vaccine will make you a 5g antennae (it won't), and some (but not a majority) think that jews are evil. And as a consequence of the lack of pushback from people who claim to be ""center right,"" people have died needlessly, and the fundamental principle of our country - democracy, is in serious danger. That's why you guys got shit on in the midterms, not because twitter didn't let you see hunter biden's dick."

Destiny mentioned previously that he feels like a loser sincerely arguing with characters but I don't understand this mentality. I have never once felt SOY hearing a good rebuttal.  We watch him for his ability to engage and win against all types of characters.   


It's especially frustrating for me since he's giving up a valuable platform to:    
\- give insightful counter-narrative to global conspiracy shit  
\- show the audience how to argue against clowns    
\- in general showcase his debating skills for growth"

I'm interested in the communities thoughts, thank you.

I have a professionally diagnosed Major Depression Disorder.  I have and am taking my meds :) I didn't see a specific topic on here, sorry if this is commonly addressed.

Telling others that I have and continue to struggle with self bad stuff and not good ideations usually comes with a stigma and embarrassment.  I don't reveal this in a professional environment for, what I hope are obvious, reasons.  I can mostly hide the bad stuff I've done to myself so I don't get questions/looks about it.  

&amp;#x200B;

It is common for me to hear jokes about *video gaming* oneself.  It is funny, weird, and oddly mocking, to me how often people hyperbolically but casually mock the value of their own lives or the self bad stuff memes.  I'm typically not a stuffy steve about this stuff though and I got some thick skin in the StarCraft ccslide days (Green Acres &gt; Hunters; fight me).  

&amp;#x200B;

Should I be sticking up for myself/others like me, more in telling people to not joke about these things not in a ""no jokes"" kinda way but telling people how it feels or is genuinely being mocked/offensive since it seems casual at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I be promoting to the public that shaming this behavior is appropriate? 

&amp;#x200B;

Should people with, probably limited to some, mental illnesses be volunteering that more publicly/professionally (Maybe we wear funny hats)? Or would you limit this to more interpersonal objectives?

&amp;#x200B;

Is it good for role models to be shamed for these types of jokes?

&amp;#x200B;

I would likely never do this out of cowardice, but if I could modify the publics reaction to me; set an imposition upon them to improve my mental health with relation to my MDD, should I?

-So here is the thing I am going to do. 
*I am going to talk about all the ways in which this video and her behavior embolden the far right, even though these aren't his intentions or position.*

And then he actually goes on actually lying about her and framing her. I covered what I saw in the next 20 to 30 minutes after this, as it's a bit insufferable to watch him go on insane moral parades that are just basically gas lighting.

I analyzed it a bit semi-live, and made a video of it:

Humor me for a second. If Lex wasn't naive or impressionable as many of you say, would you think he is dangerous? Well, that is the case I'm going to try to make.

**Why the Doctor K of AI?** 

It turns out that he is pretty much a joke in the AI community, this blog post by an actual AI researcher sums up some of the criticism \[1\]. Lex is a researcher at MIT as he is listed in the directory, although his research papers were removed from MIT and the internet from what I can tell. The problem is that none of his research was peer reviewed, his research was cited by Elon when he was selling Tesla's auto pilot feature \[2\]. Lex solicited the press before trying to get his research peer reviewed and when actual scientist encouraged him to submit for peer review before it's published he blocked them. Anima Anandkumar famously was blocked by Lex \[3\], she is a Bren Professor at Caltech and Senior Director of AI Research at NVIDIA. He also blocks pretty much anyone with criticism \[4\]. Missy Cumings a professor at Duke University and director of Duke's Humans and Autonomy Laboratory criticized Lex \[5\] as well. Apparently he preemptively blocks people \[6\].

The reason I see an issue with this is not because I want to purity check him but I think this is enough to at least be suspicious of what he says. It annoyed me that he tried to tone police Destiny. He talks about integrity and love.

People have actually died using the Tesla autopilot. People were convinced that the tesla auto pilot would improve over time as Elon said and made a purchase. I actually know someone who did this and famously Boogie used the self driving feature as an excuse to buy the Tesla \[7\]. Lex apologized for his research \[8\] but the damage was already done. I don't care about the apology as well because he is still backing Elon and Tesla and the ""research"" already had the positive effects. If he was really sorry, I would expect him to be more critical of Tesla but he won't because he is friends with Elon. Knowing how petty these people are, I really think Elon saw what Destiny said and decided not to unblock him. 

Why do you criticize the COVID researcher on Joe Rogan over stating his credentials, while you look up to Lex? Is it his suit? The word MIT? Jiujitsu? His deep voice?

With all that being said, I have watched Lex in the past and I enjoyed the podcast. I don't hate the guy but I think we should be critical. Love and peace.

137,Destiny," As a dedicated fan of the Twitch streamer Destiny, I must say that I am consistently impressed by his skill and dedication to the games he streams. Whether he is showcasing his debate skills or dominating in Factorio, Destiny always brings his A-game and entertains his viewers with his infectious energy and enthusiasm.

In terms of debate, Destiny's streams are always fascinating to watch. He invites other debaters onto his streams to engage in friendly debates on a wide range of topics, and he often hosts impromptu debates with members of his community. Watching these debates, I have learned a lot about different perspectives and arguments, and I have enjoyed seeing how Destiny and his guests approach each topic.

When it comes to Factorio, Destiny's streams are equally engaging. He is incredibly skilled at the game, and he provides valuable tips and strategies for other players. Watching his streams, I have learned a lot about the game's mechanics and systems, and I have even picked up some useful strategies for my own gameplay.

But what truly sets Destiny apart from other streamers is his commitment to giving back to his community. He frequently raises money for charities through his streams, and he often partners with other streamers to host larger charity events. This dedication to making a positive impact in the world is truly admirable, and it is one of the many reasons why I am such a fan of his streams.

Overall, I am a huge fan of Destiny and his streams. He is a talented debater and a skilled gamer, and his passion for both topics shines through in every stream. If you're a fan of debate or Factorio, I highly recommend checking out his streams.

I understand that Counterpoints kept bringing up his past work when defending his argument, which can be annoying to argue against.

146,Destiny,"I'm still recovering from Covid (many of us from the weekend are) and Destiny was sick like the first day, so I think we know who patient zero was...

Anyways, I decided to get more involved in stuff like this in 2022 and also was an election worker in my local precinct earlier this year for the midterms.  All I can say is that, yes, it feels weird at first to take the first step, but is incredibly rewarding.  The first few doors were nerve-racking, but they were good experiences and then  the rest of the weekend was so much easier!  I went out all four canvassing shifts - I also worked 17 hours on midterm election day - and felt better after all that than a normal day at work even though it was exhausting.

Destiny talked after the 2020 canvassing about the key being accessibility.  If you can make events like this as easy as possible for someone to show up and get to work, it increases volunteer turnout for the future.  Matt and Sejin did an amazing job organizing the weekend on such a short time span and the amount of work that goes into wrangling this amount of people is astronomical.  In fact, it sort of seemed like a lot of the mild problems experienced were because so many people showed up rather than any specific thing going wrong.

I'm in the older demo of this community and barely am in chat at all, but DGG was super welcoming.  No one knew anyone else and no group felt cliquey.  Everyone knew everyone else was coming in knowing nobody so we were all trying to find folks to meet and talk to.  I sat down with groups all through the weekend and met new people each time plus a few of the streamers.  I rescued some DGGers with some jumper cables and each group I went out with for actual canvassing were awesome.

All I can say is I am energized to do more of this next year even though it won't be with DGG and I really encourage folks to give it a shot in their local communities.  Local groups need help organizing and many are ready to give you a clipboard and make it easy for you to get started.  The social anxiety is a lot to overcome, but you'd be surprised how positive and friendly most people you will interact with are.  TRY IT plus it's cool to know you got up, touched grass, and made a small difference.",My Experience Cavnassing,1670978043,"My Experience Cavnassing I'm still recovering from Covid (many of us from the weekend are) and Destiny was sick like the first day, so I think we know who patient zero was...

All I can say is that, yes, it feels weird at first to take the first step, but is incredibly rewarding.  The first few doors were nerve-racking, but they were good experiences and then  the rest of the weekend was so much easier!  I went out all four canvassing shifts - I also worked 17 hours on midterm election day - and felt better after all that than a normal day at work even though it was exhausting.

Destiny talked after the 2020 canvassing about the key being accessibility.  If you can make events like this as easy as possible for someone to show up and get to work, it increases volunteer turnout for the future.  Matt and Sejin did an amazing job organizing the weekend on such a short time span and the amount of work that goes into wrangling this amount of people is astronomical.  In fact, it sort of seemed like a lot of the mild problems experienced were because so many people showed up rather than any specific thing going wrong.

I'm in the older demo of this community and barely am in chat at all, but DGG was super welcoming.  No one knew anyone else and no group felt cliquey.  Everyone knew everyone else was coming in knowing nobody so we were all trying to find folks to meet and talk to.  I sat down with groups all through the weekend and met new people each time plus a few of the streamers.  I rescued some DGGers with some jumper cables and each group I went out with for actual canvassing were awesome.

All I can say is I am energized to do more of this next year even though it won't be with DGG and I really encourage folks to give it a shot in their local communities.  Local groups need help organizing and many are ready to give you a clipboard and make it easy for you to get started.  The social anxiety is a lot to overcome, but you'd be surprised how positive and friendly most people you will interact with are.  TRY IT plus it's cool to know you got up, touched grass, and made a small difference."
147,Destiny,"I hear the claim all the time that “The Overton Window† has shifted so far to the right.” But when I’m observing right spaces or I’m among right friends, the exact same claim is made, just swapping “right” for “left.” For those who don’t know, the Overton Window is specifically meant to represent the ideas that are mainstream accepted within a society and, as such, specifically does not address fringe extremism. Anyway, those making these claims about the Window shifting all have compelling examples. The left can point at mainstream discussions about voter suppression or restrictive immigration policy. The right can point at mainstream discussions of anti-white sentiments and police abolition. But these things aren’t within the Overton Window. 

The Overton Window has fractured into two distinct, distant points (not ranges), with a narrower-than-ever Overton Window somewhere in between. Let’s look at this via one issue as an example (though I think it broadly applies to every major disagreement in society now, such as free speech, police, immigration, Western military intervention, etc). Ten years ago, the Overton Window on trans rights generally spread the range of (on the left) “There is a distinct difference between gender and sex, and people who experience gender dysphoria are at elevated risks of suicide so should be treated as the gender they identify as” to (on the right) “If men want to put on dresses and call themselves women, those [t-slur]s can do whatever they want,” with most people clustered in “I don’t really care about definitions of gender and sex, but adults are free to do what they want with their bodies, though children shouldn’t be able to make that decision.” This Overton Window still exists, in a way (I mean, I still agree with the left position of the window), but most people have now siphoned themselves off to one of the two points that fractured off. The left point says, “You’re a bigot if you suggest that a trans person has a different sex from their gender, and the reason we should care about trans people is because they’re trans, whether or not they have ever had gender dysphoria,” and the right point says, “Trans people have a calculated agenda to turn children trans, people should not have the right to choose medically what they want for themselves, and doctors who provide gender affirming care should be imprisoned.” Both of these ideas are, in my opinion, absolutely bonkers. Just plain silly (pardon my language). But both are also completely in the mainstream. 

How did we get here? The answer to that could be an entire post unto itself; I’ll just keep this brief and conclude. We got this way in part because we drew a line in the middle of the Overton Window and told everyone on our side of the line to stop communicating with those on the other side, and then, even more nefariously, once the new positions had been carved out, the message was to stop communicating with anyone who wasn’t on the same exact _point_ as you. The Overton Window, to whatever extent it still exists, is a feeble remnant of what it once was, dwarfed by two towers of extremist ideology.

231,Destiny,"Hey y’all; last night we saw a debate between counter points and Destiny about the Hunter Biden laptop/ “corruption” within Intelligence agencies. I just wanted to clarify some things counter points said regarding his experience with Law Enforcement.

Context I’ve worked for a relatively large police department in Florida for the last two years and this is our general structure.

Rank and file cops in my department don’t carry cameras to take crime scene photos. Crime scene photos are generally taken either by CSI; or by workers called Community Service Officers/ Police Service Aides. 

The CSO and PSA generally take photos of burglaries to vehicles, minor vandalisms, and car accidents involving damage to city property. CSO and PSA can swipe for fingerprints; however if there is blood involved or if it is a crime involving serious injury, death, or hate speech a CSI tech is dispatched.

Now for the rank and file cop in my city most of the time they aren’t going to be the one conducting the investigation leading to a big prosecution like a murder charge. They will write an initial report detailing what incidents occurred on scene and what they discovered while on scene. But more than likely the case will be passed onto the detective unit due to them being more experienced in knowing what is needed for a conviction and it keeps road patrol officers from being tied down on a case and away from their usual job, patrol.

Also in my experience generally to become some type of detective you need a certain amount of time on the road before putting in for a spot. Usually 3-5 years. There are exceptions like if you work in a very large department where they have plenty of openings to fill; or in departments where nobody wants the position and you put in (what happened to me).

It is possible in smaller departments patrol officers may have to wear the investigator cap and take crime scene photos.

237,Destiny,"Should social media companies be regulated as **common carriers**?

The legal tension between Twitter's **editorial discretion** (right to moderate content) and users' **free speech rights** (right to use service) has yet to be resolved in the Supreme Court. 



Since the late 1950's, the Supreme Court has aggressively protected and expanded not just the individual's **right to speech**, but also the public's **access to** the widest range of constitutionally protected speech:



""*Smith v California 1959 and its progeny concerned state laws that – by threatening liability for facilitating others’ speech – prompted intermediaries such as bookstores and newspapers to curtail their distribution of protected speech. As this Court emphasized, intermediaries’ rational caution in the face of potential liability deprives the public of robust access to all kinds of speech–exactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect.*"" 

The Court has consistently fought to avoid chilling protected speech by striking down laws that would incentivize free speech intermediaries to impose strict content moderation policies.

On the other hand, the Court has also protected **editorial discretion** as an independent component of the Freedom of Speech (CBS v. Democratic Nat'l Committee, 412 U.S. 94 (1973)). Newspapers, online newsletters, TV stations, and any other publishers cannot be compelled to publish speech that they don't wish to publish. They’re entitled to constitutional protection from government interference with their free speech rights.

Common carriers are companies hold themselves out to the general public as providers of transportation or communications services. Because they are common carriers, they must provide these services without discrimination against or in favor of particular persons, groups, or content. Newspapers are not common carriers. Cellular companies, ISPs, railroads, freight companies, and airlines are.  Common carriers cannot refuse service to a person based on their views.

 Does Twitter function more as a newspaper with editorial discretion, or more like a telephone company offering a public service?

If Twitter and other social medias are essentially the most recent technological manifestations of communication services (telegraph, landline, cellular), then they should be regulated as common carriers. Just as a telephone company cannot prevent people from conversing over its networks to express views it disfavors, neither should Twitter have editorial discretion over its users' speech. The Court has already established the liability shield for free speech intermediaries, ensuring that the speech of a social media site’s users is not the speech of the company that runs the social media site. It then follows that regulating Twitter as a common carrier is not compelling them to publish certain speech, but rather preventing them from limiting individual users' ability to post their own speech.

I care greatly about reducing beliefs in covid conspiracies, election denial, racism, homophobia, transphobia, holocaust denial, and every other kind of mind-rot plaguing current U.S. politics.

238,Destiny,"Connor continuously got offended that people didn't believe his theory and said over and over that he was getting pissed off that he was being made out to look like some low IQ person and clung onto three dumb ass defenses.   


1. Destiny and I agree on 80% (not true)
2. Destiny knows me through other mutual friends (and?)
3. I was an investigator  


The little I knew about Connor was his short time as a cop from panels we've been on before. I did not think he could have been an investigator professionally if it was from his time in policing that would warrant credibility for his conspiracy. I truly believe he is conspiracy brained and actually tried for almost 5 minutes to calmly show him that with his own behavior.  


I pointed out that his first claim in the call where he made a statement on the intelligence of the twitter algorithm that he heard from another person would not meet any investigators standard for information they would stake a claim on. Especially after the person (whoever tf that was) felt he needed to clarify what he told Connor (because he was not summarized/repeated correctly) and also went on to say that he offered to go more in depth about it to Connor, implying Connor knew there was more info to learn that he felt he didnt need to be confident in his conclusion.  


A reasonable person should be able to see the flaws in having this level of confidence for such shallow understandings and sources.   


My humor can totally be toxic. Connor telling me people died in his arms and that he's taken photos and investigated cp and animal abuse was totally irrelevant though, and had nothing to do with the investigator credentials he kept playing like a fucking uno card from 3 years as a parol officer to imply his conspiracies were logical.  


Idc about Connor's unhinged insults to me until I see anyone imply I was the ONLY toxic person in that exchange. Interesting he had no insults to WickedSupreme (who also made a joke about him 'solving' that homicide) or anyone else cracking jokes at him. All of it right to my ass. Make it violent, call me a cunt, tell me I need to die and I'm absolutely the fucking worst, spoiled fucking brat that should be killed. I'm used to bringing the absolute best out of people.  


What is fucking weird to me is having a dude pull out his trauma like it's a certificate of authority. I consider Counterpoints as much of an investigator as BsBullet but I do truly believe Connor was upset and not just being performative. I think that situation must have been very traumatic and life altering for him. I also still think its irrelevant information and was thrown at me in an emotional rage in response to a snarky comment. All I said was I don't think he should say he was a professional investigator.  


  
tl;dr  
I'm sorry you're a cis white male and this is the only victim card you can throw in a debate to win.

I pointed out that his first claim in the call where he made a statement on the intelligence of the twitter algorithm that he heard from another person would not meet any investigators standard for information they would stake a claim on. Especially after the person (whoever tf that was) felt he needed to clarify what he told Connor (because he was not summarized/repeated correctly) and also went on to say that he offered to go more in depth about it to Connor, implying Connor knew there was more info to learn that he felt he didnt need to be confident in his conclusion.  


A reasonable person should be able to see the flaws in having this level of confidence for such shallow understandings and sources.   


My humor can totally be toxic. Connor telling me people died in his arms and that he's taken photos and investigated cp and animal abuse was totally irrelevant though, and had nothing to do with the investigator credentials he kept playing like a fucking uno card from 3 years as a parol officer to imply his conspiracies were logical.  


Idc about Connor's unhinged insults to me until I see anyone imply I was the ONLY toxic person in that exchange. Interesting he had no insults to WickedSupreme (who also made a joke about him 'solving' that homicide) or anyone else cracking jokes at him. All of it right to my ass. Make it violent, call me a cunt, tell me I need to die and I'm absolutely the fucking worst, spoiled fucking brat that should be killed. I'm used to bringing the absolute best out of people.  


What is fucking weird to me is having a dude pull out his trauma like it's a certificate of authority. I consider Counterpoints as much of an investigator as BsBullet but I do truly believe Connor was upset and not just being performative. I think that situation must have been very traumatic and life altering for him. I also still think its irrelevant information and was thrown at me in an emotional rage in response to a snarky comment. All I said was I don't think he should say he was a professional investigator.  


  
tl;dr  
I'm sorry you're a cis white male and this is the only victim card you can throw in a debate to win.

275,Destiny," Hey guys,

I just wanted to share my thoughts on why I absolutely adore Zionism. (That was sarcastic, by the way.)

First of all, I love how Zionism is all about saying that Jewish people are better than everyone else and have a ""God-given"" right to the land of Israel. I mean, who doesn't love a good old-fashioned superiority complex? And I especially love how this belief ignores the fact that Palestinian Arabs have been living in the land for centuries. Oops, our bad!

But here's the best part: Zionism is also super inclusive and accepting of diversity. (Again, sarcasm.) It only excludes those who don't fit the criteria of being a member of the ""chosen"" nation. So if you're not a Zionist Jew, you're basically a second-class citizen. And if you're a Palestinian Arab, well, you're basically screwed.

And let's not forget about all the wonderful consequences of Zionism, like the ongoing conflicts and human rights abuses in the region. The occupation of Palestinian territories, the building of settlements, and the violence against Palestinian people are all just part of the fun of being a Zionist.

In conclusion, I absolutely adore Zionism because it's discriminatory, exclusionary, and leads to all sorts of problems. (That was sarcastic, in case you couldn't tell.) How about we reject this BS ideology and instead work towards a more inclusive and equitable solution for everyone in the region?",Why I love Zionism (not),1670910335,"Why I love Zionism (not)  Hey guys,

284,Destiny,"I'm pro-representation in media and I want to make that clear before I continue. I think that marginalized people ***SHOULD*** have some sort of representation in the media. 

However, my problem with this whole thing is the shallowness of all of it. I can't buy the fact that a person can ***ONLY*** relate to a character because they have the same skin color or are the same gender.

Let's take Lara Croft as an example:

She is an extremely attractive young-adult woman who knows multiple languages, is insanely physically strong, knows how to survive in harsh and unpredictable environments, can take down armies of grown and skilled soldiers, has an above-average IQ, and is just badass. Also, she comes from a wealthy family and is posh as hell.

Lara Croft is not relatable at all. She is a ***power-fantasy character***. I don't know how a woman can see that and say, *""OMG I'm just like her"".* The thing a woman can say is, *""I relate to Lara's inner struggle to cope with her father's murder because I too lost a family member in dramatic circumstances"".*

The problem that arises from this example is that ***ANYONE*** can relate to Lara. Anyone can lose a family member or a friend and say that Lara is super relatable in that way. It stops being ***a woman-specific thing***. 

That intrinsic shallowness of people's idea of how different people/cultures should be portrayed in mass media is quite baffling to me. A fictional character needs to be something more than a pair of genitals or a different skin tone for that character to work. 

A film like Moonlight is a great example of well-implemented representation. The subject matter of that film touches on REAL LIFE issues that the black community has to deal with on a regular. 

The problem is that Moonlight is a ***niche*** little art project that only film snobs give a shit about.

Mainstream Hollywood ruins our perception of what representation should mean and I'm sick and tired of it.

Unfortunately, many people interpreted this word as to describe all 'black zoomer streamers'. 

Example: *There's a* ***legion*** *of patients in the waiting room and they are very impatient.*

Coupled with the narrative that patients are impatient, this example paints all the patients in the waiting room to be impatient. Similarly, the harmful black stereotypes on black people being 'wacky and wild' would work to build the idea that such was what Destiny were painting most, if not all, 'black zoomer streamers' as.

Listen up, you worthless peasants. I, Steven bonnell aka Destiny, have had enough of your misguided and ignorant opinions on the greatest beverage in the world: hot chocolate.

For far too long, hot chocolate has been overshadowed by the likes of coffee and tea, despite the fact that it is clearly the superior choice. Don't believe me? Let me lay out the facts for you.

First of all, hot chocolate is delicious. It's rich, creamy, and chocolatey, with just the right amount of sweetness. Coffee and tea, on the other hand, are bitter and acidic, and no amount of sugar or cream can mask the awful taste.

Second, hot chocolate is good for you. Chocolate, the main ingredient in hot chocolate, is packed with antioxidants and other nutrients that can help boost your mood, improve your cognitive function, and even lower your risk of heart disease. Coffee and tea, on the other hand, can have negative effects on your health, such as increased anxiety and heart palpitations.

Finally, hot chocolate is versatile. You can drink it hot or cold, spiked or non-alcoholic, and even add in flavorings like peppermint or cinnamon to mix things up. Coffee and tea, on the other hand, are boring and one-dimensional.

So there you have it, folks. Hot chocolate is the best beverage in the world, and anyone who says otherwise is a fool. Don't be one of those fools – start drinking hot chocolate today and taste the difference for yourself.

Long live hot chocolate!

328,Destiny,"A) The First Way: Motion

1. All bodies are either potentially in motion or actually in motion.
2. ""But nothing can be reduced from potentiality to actuality, except by something in a state of actuality"".
3. Nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality in the same respect.
4. Therefore nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality with respect to motion
5. Therefore nothing can move itself; it must be put into motion by something else.
6. If there were no ""first mover, moved by no other"" there would be no motion.
7. But there is motion.
8. Therefore there is a first mover, God.

B) The Second Way: Efficient Cause

1. Nothing is the efficient cause of itself.
2. If A is the efficient cause of B, then if A is absent, so is B.
3. Efficient causes are ordered from first cause, through intermediate cause(s), to ultimate effect.
4. By (2) and (3), if there is no first cause, there cannot be any ultimate effect.
5. But there are effects.
6. Therefore there must be a first cause for all of them: God.

C) The Third Way: Possibility and Necessity

1. ""We find in nature things that are possible to be and not to be:"" contingent beings.
2. Everything is either necessary or contingent.
3. Assume that everything is contingent.
4. ""It is impossible for \[contingent beings\] always to exist, for that which can not-be at some time is not.""
5. Therefore, by (3) and (4), at one time there was nothing.
6. ""That which does not exist begins to exist only through something already existing.""
7. Therefore, by (5) and (6), there is nothing now.
8. But there is something now!
9. Therefore (3) is false.
10. Therefore, by (2), there is a necessary being: God.

D) The Fourth Way: Gradation

1. There is a gradation to be found in things: some are better (hotter, colder, etc.) than others.
2. Things are X in proportion to how closely the resemble that which is most X.
3. Therefore, if there is nothing which is most X, there can be nothing which is good.
4. It follows that if anything is good, there must be something that is most good.
5. ""Therefore there must also be something which is to all beings the cause of their being, goodness, and every other perfection; and this we call God"".

E) The Fifth Way: Design

1. We observe that natural bodies act toward ends.
2. Anything that acts toward an end either acts out of knowledge, or under the direction of something with knowledge, ""as the arrow is directed by the archer.""
3. But many natural beings lack knowledge.
4. ""Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God""",Thomistic Proofs for God- Any thoughts?,1670883945,"Thomistic Proofs for God- Any thoughts? A) The First Way: Motion

My background is a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and I took some very basic CS classes as part of my curriculum, and while I enjoyed coding, I went through the rest of my academic career thinking mechanical was for me. Fast forward 6 years into my professional career and not only is my field saturated as fuck with mediocre field growth, I'm not really getting all that much enjoyment from work, and I'm also not invested enough to return for a Masters/PhD in mechanical engineering.

I'm heavily considering transitioning into IT Security/Analyst or Web Development and was wondering if I genuinely need to apply for a Masters program at a university or if a bootcamp will yield similar results for a fraction of the cost. So if anyone has any insight into why one would be better than the other, experience with graduates from either, or any alternatives. Before the memes start, I'm not looking to take a 6 week part time course and expect to make $180k at Google. I just want to be more engaged with my work in a field with higher prospects, while capitalizing on the background I've already slightly started on.

If you made it this far, my coding experience is Matlab and R console, which I know is more math intensive that C++, Python, etc. but I'm told basic understanding of syntax carries over pretty well.

Destiny seems to want to be productive in conversations so I doubt he would, but next time someone tries to do this, he should just tell them chat agrees with him and they're being a contrarian because that puts them in the minority opinion for the conversation."

***Protests***

In November, the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou was [shook by more protests](https://nypost.com/2022/11/23/hundreds-of-workers-protest-at-foxconns-flagship-iphone-plant-in-china/), flaring up after Foxconn recruited new workers to fill the gap caused by the walkout in October with promises of bonuses and higher wages, and then unilaterally changed the contracts. Additionally new workers lived with current ones, causing new ones to be designated as close contacts or even test positive, possibly preventing them from moving elsewhere after bridging the gap in unemployment or meeting their family for the spring festival in the following year.
[Police]( https://twitter.com/i/status/1595453887451758594) [forcefully]( https://twitter.com/i/status/1595247610507702272) [suppressed]( https://twitter.com/i/status/1595244506693402625) the protests.

[Meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/z44v0s/rchina_irl/)

Foxconn got a hold of protests, promising cash boni for workers and letting them leave the factory, even offering transport it seems. [Mr. Wenzhao points out](https://youtu.be/MHqs21DXZVo?t=270) that the manufacturing industry’s contribution to the overall economy is dropping faster in China than in other industrialized countries, possibly signaling a wave of unemployment as part of recession due to the strong relationship between the manufacturing sector and jobs created in logistics and the service industry.

**Personal opinion incoming**

In the past weeks, protests against covid measures and the regime have spread across China, mainly driven by students and people that had been locked into their homes for extended periods of time, lacking food, water, and an income to provide for themselves. I think it is safe to say that the dissatisfaction of Chinese citizens has reached unprecedented levels, even if it might not necessarily bring the change, or change to the degree that one might wish for. To be clear, the scale and organization of these protests is relevant historically, this probably being the biggest, most organized protest since 89, but is far from significant enough to enable any real change in society or the system. More relevant, in my opinion, is the signal it sends to the citizens that feel the same way, and to us. People have been pushed past their endurance, and this marks a turn in the relationship between the government and the people. The compromise between sacrifice of freedom for material gain might have expired, the young generation is old enough to formulate demands, the “Lower class” is at its limit due to covid measures, unable to sustain a livelihood, and the government has failed to react in any capacity.
The abrupt outburst can be attributed to two factors. First, despite the 20 improved zero covid measures, that sparked hope of gradual opening, measures have been and are tightening in many cities, destroying the last hope of many people for an improvement of the situation. In addition, a fire in Urumqi killed 10 residents (according to official reports), which was understood by many to be a direct result of the tight measures in Urumqi hindering rescue personnel to properly manage the situation.
The protests have been coined the “White Paper/Sheet Revolution”, as many protesters are holding up blank sheets of paper resembling the censorship and inability to voice concerns.
[This twitter account](https://twitter.com/whyyoutouzhele) (Mandarin) reports on stuff that cannot be reported on within the country, received and is receiving video material and information by Chinese citizens involved in the protests daily, was posting by the minute when it started.

***Covid***

A [conference with experts](http://www.gov.cn/guowuyuan/2022-11/30/content_5729738.htm) on the subject of the covid measures took place, allowing them to bring up their perspective and recommendations for the measures. Up until now, experts were either not involved in measures or were secondary to political motives, especially regarding Omicron. Mr Wenzhao correctly points out the phrase zero covid does not appear in the report above, while the lower fatality of Omicron, higher vaccination rates and learning effects of the past years are said to bring about a new form of prevention, endorsing the scientific perspective of said experts. This marks a noticeable change in communication. The Twitter account mentioned above also leaked a recently gone viral audio file (https://twitter.com/whyyoutouzhele) of a teacher in Sichuan allegedly sharing plans of utilizing the school as grounds to perform a herd immunity experiment meant to be pushed to the rest of the country. [This article](https://www.wenxuecity.com/news/2022/12/02/11996775.html) reports on it, but of course the legitimacy of the recording is not confirmed.

[Another one of Mr Wenzhao’s takes](https://youtu.be/mp2DF1V84NI?t=192) I want to share: There is still no reason to believe that this will bring about the significant change that is wanted and needed. He compares the actions taken to easing your belt a bit after eating too much, which is not a bad thing for the people without income and livelihood but is also not a huge deal when looking at the bigger picture. 

[10 new improved covid measures](http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2022-12/07/content_5730443.htm) have been published and are being implemented 
The most relevant changes are:

1) The scope of lockdowns is now limited to a maximum of one building, preventing local governments from shutting down whole districts.

2) Health QR codes will only be checked to enter i.e. kindergartens, nursing homes, retirement homes etc.

3) Only high-risk workers have to keep providing test results to attend work

Stuff to keep in mind: Lockdowns are dependent on diligence of district personnel when checking temperatures, demanding tests, and reporting results, technically you might still end up in a locked down district if every building gets screwed by somebody testing positive. As testing is also reduced, this is pretty unlikely though.
No comprehensive list of “high risk jobs” is available.
Close contacts, counter to previous expectations, still have to quarantine 5 days but can choose to do so in their home.
After beginning to open up since last Wednesday, [cases are surging](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-12-china-expert-covid-rapidly-easing.html) (continuing a previous trend) and China’s healthcare system is facing significant challenges this winter, which is going to take a toll on the population. Lack of preparation in the years of the pandemic and focus on other measures like mass testing lead up to the current situation, where neither keeping the lockdowns, nor opening up seems to be sustainable.

***Xi Jin Ping***

On the 7th of December, the yearly [conference of the central committee of the CCP](http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2022-12/07/content_5730396.htm), moderated by Xi himself, was held. Noticeably, neither the ten improved covid regulations, nor anything about the White Paper Revolution was mentioned.
I will share some of Mr Wenzhao’s analysis here regarding Xi Jin Ping’s political nature and his reaction, it’s a big chunk of [this video](https://youtu.be/Zh0SLnKKacw?t=415), so I won’t go ahead and timestamp everything but the beginning of the segment and take a shot at a summary.

Xi is tied into the Zero Covid policy, it being a personal project of his closely linked to his agenda, making it almost impossible to logically separate him from the responsibility for it. At the same time, the White Paper Revolution and the protests clearly signal the failure of the policy in the eyes of the people, making it a de-facto failure politically speaking. From the notice on the conference and past events, Mr Wenzhao infers the following.
While there is no mention of the protests or the adjusted regulations, notice is given on action that will be taken against corruption, namely within the testing industry, which is large and has been thriving in China due to the measures. Given the nature of China’s system and history, a pretty significant amount of corruption is basically guaranteed to exist in that area, so the move makes sense. At the same time, the bigger priority is likely to shift blame to bureaucratic figures for messing up execution of the zero covid policy and misrepresenting scope with false reports etc., achieving some decoupling between Xi and the policy in terms of responsibility.
Related to this, the absence of any party speak on the protests in the notice, even in the form of roundabout finger points at foreign influence etc., in combination with the focus on inside corruption, signals that Xi perceives more danger within the bureaucratic body itself than the actual protests. This goes along with the notion of Xi stepping down and Li (Ke Qiang) replacing him before the 20th party congress and related camps within the party as well as Hu Jin Tao being escorted from the venue during the congress. Not mentioning the ten new covid regulations deepens the impression of a break between bureaucracy and political leadership.
Learning from history, relevant historic references, and rituals are practices tied deeply into the fabric of the party and Chinese society, South-East Asia even, due to the major influence of Confucianism. In that fashion, Xi’s first action after the 20th party congress was to visit延安 (Yan an), where the [rectification movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan'an_Rectification_Movement) of the CCP in 1942 originated, the first ideological mass movement of the Communist party, that would result in Mao’s cult of personality. This is a pretty clear indicator of Xi Jin Ping’s attitude towards the current state of the party and its internal affairs, calling for 整风 (rectification) before change can take place. (Putting the Chinese there because it carries more weight as a concept in Chinese than just saying rectification, due to its historical implication).
Reminder: This is the personal breakdown of an individual that I then summarized, so there is room for further discussion and other perspectives. But especially the visit of Yan An is in my opinion objectively a pretty clear indicator of Xi’s perception and I think the analysis is pretty coherent.

434,Destiny,"He said [in this video at 23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqrr07RwSVM) that he's spoken to a lot of younger women who have a negative view of pregnancy and childbirth in a discussion about the red pill and dating, and I know about data that offers an explanation for this.

Basically, society forces women to choose between being a mother and having a career. The gender wage gap today [is more about being a mom than being a woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP8dLUxBfsU). Additionally, [the most reliable predictor of someone's stance on abortion is their view on gender roles](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-dividing-line-on-abortion/) as opposed to a political party or religious status.

Basically, society forces women to choose between being a mother and having a career. The gender wage gap today [is more about being a mom than being a woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP8dLUxBfsU). Additionally, [the most reliable predictor of someone's stance on abortion is their view on gender roles](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-real-dividing-line-on-abortion/) as opposed to a political party or religious status.

In hindsight I think i was too focused on balenciaga and their response to that as I mentioned in an earlier paragraph. In fact a person Xan retweeted a little before that lead me to read and look into how these “conspiracies” harm children as I mentioned.

I think Xan’s a good guy and I commend him for leaving the far right and advocating for things I can tell he genuinely cares about a lot of the time. 

I focused too much on balenciaga, but I think there is still a point to be made with my concern, that this downplaying and lack of a strong stance against it will fuel “groomer” allegations against the lgbtq community.

I know theres hateful people on the right who place the blame on the entire community, theres also those on the right who don’t (of course I realize the argument at that point is  they’ll stand with those people though)

But by not atleast explaining the bad and good things with balenciaga and why the weird ad happened in a way that doesnt come across as downplaying, ou are giving more fuel to the right against the community. 

Granted plenty of people on the right will hate people like myself anyways. (And id imagine even moreso for those more politically opposed) thats shitty, and it shouldn’t happen. 

I think shoe was irresponsible for not addressing the narrative when someone she followed it toook it out of hand against all lgbt people. I also think DM, and Xan could’ve had a more strategic response to it to ensure safety of the lgbtq and their spehere of the community.

I have unfortunately come to the conclusion that, at least past a certain level of development, it is impossible to change one's sexual orientation. I have begun to wonder if I may have been able to turn myself gay, or at least bi, at an earlier stage in life; I remember a time in 7th grade where I jacked off to gay porn for like a month straight, and I think I developed a crush on a male friend of mine at the time as well. It wasn't even the sex part of the porn that I really liked; it was just the dudes kissing.

Eventually those feelings passed however, and I have been unable to tap into them again at any point since. I have heard from browsing trans communities that some previously lesbian trans women have developed an attraction to men after taking prog; however, I don't want to stick female hormones up my butt, and I would also like to remain a man, so this option is closed to me.

Overall, I'm against Steven's ""homophobia"" shown in this clip. I use quotes simply cuz I understand why he did it, obviously these guys are super homophobic and making jokes about them like that makes them mad 😂. Ok, but I believe this is just going just a smidge too far.

 ""if you feel that feminine go get a boyfriend"" (paraphrase). Really? After the complaints about the ""bootyjudge"" comments and everything? Idk I'm just sick of being bi/gay (more male love from me 🤭) having the stigma of ""being a bitch, being a pussy, oh your feminine (gay 😮‍💨) why don't you just get fucked in the ass by big BBC?"" It must be easy to say those things when you're only just barely bi, stolen valor much? (That was a half joke but I still don't get it is Steven bi or is that just misinfo I heard he really isn't or just on like one circumstance 😅😅?) I still love our lil teeny blue hair politics guy, but this was just TRIGGERING to hear at work and I had to type my thoughts out at lunch. I'm just sick of a few things. 1. Being called ""feminine"" for liking guys. I'm the top and technically full that ""role"" in our relationship but neither of us are particularly feminine. And 2. That being a problem. Are feminine men bad? Should all men be ""real men"" and be super macho stoic and shit? Obviously not.

I'm sure if I said something really dumb I'll get raped in the comments for it, but this was just a thought I had and had to get out while I was at lunch.

IGN: 10/10 ""masterpiece""

A game that I've tried and set aside multiple times for nearly a decade, Dwarf Fortress has long been an enigma to me. On paper, it sounds like the perfect game for someone like me; immersive management sim, deep mechanics, and assumes you're not retarded.

Yet, for anyone who has ever tried Dwarf Fortress, you'll probably sympathize with the irony that these admired qualities in the game were the exact things that drove me away from it initially - featuring a learning curve so steep that the toll of the climb outweighed the eventual view I'd be able to enjoy from the top of the mountain. 

Well my friends - happy to say that D.F.'s new release on Steam is WAY more approachable than its ASCII predecessor. 

Still difficult

Still requires a bit of googling to understand some of its mechanics

But playing it this past week has helped me finally scratch the surface of the hype that I've heard so much about. The graphics, while better than the original, still leave a lot to be desired, but considering the depth of the simulation (actions, personalities, desires, lore throughout the world being generated every tick, etc.), I think that any further visual upgrades would make it the late-game unplayable for most computers.

While a lot of Destiny fans are obviously gamers, the audience at large is mostly interested in philosophy and politics, and the overwhelming majority of games don't engage players on that level. Video games that challenge industry conventions are as rare as they are compelling, and I've made it my business to deliver morally complex and thematically rich products which unapologetically experiment with the medium. If you're the type of person who likes to contemplate complex moral quandaries, or if you're looking for a new, visceral survival experience that can challenge both your ethics and view of life? I'd like to proudly introduce you to Yuma Will Burn.

*Yuma  Will Burn is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.*

As  a developer, I've taken a risk by dedicating so much time to a game of this type. The genre is VERY obscure and niche. I still did it though,  because I believe in both the artistic value of a deep and disempowering narrative experience and the unbridled passion this audience for them has.

Video games that challenge industry conventions are as rare as they are compelling, and I've made it my business to deliver morally complex and thematically rich products which unapologetically experiment with the medium. If you're the type of person who likes to contemplate complex moral quandaries, or if you're looking for a new, visceral survival experience that can challenge both your ethics and view of life? I'd like to proudly introduce you to Yuma Will Burn.

*Yuma  Will Burn is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.*

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma\_Will\_Burn/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma_Will_Burn/)

As  a developer, I've taken a risk by dedicating so much time to a game of this type. The genre is VERY obscure and niche. I still did it though,  because I believe in both the artistic value of a deep and disempowering narrative experience and the unbridled passion this audience for them has.

I encourage you to check out and wishlist the game with the link above. I'm a biased party, but I think it's worth your time."

Imagine you're a conquistador and someone tells you that 'colonizing Mexicans is wrong'. 


Now that you think about it, you feel discomfort with the way you are treating others. 

Should you create a perfect moral system that has no logical errors in order to that allows you continue what you are doing?

609,Destiny,"So basically Destiny thinks Boomer can be used to describe Millennials because of how He's seen it used. Here's an example

&gt;Look at that ***boomer*** over there! He's 30 years old and listens to Nirvana. How Sad!

He's also said there are two definitions of boomer

1. A person from the baby boomer generation
2. Someone who's out of touch with young people

He's said that most people use the 2nd version of boomer and that the 1st isn't really used in common parlance.

I think He's thinking about this wrong. When you read my example above, the word boomer, at least how I've always thought of it in my head, is not a different word than the original boomer. In my head there is only one definition of boomer, but when the word boomer is used towards someone who is not literally a boomer, it is used as shorthand for a simile. Let me bring up my example and expand it to show what I mean.

713,Destiny,"Anyone that has been up to date with the recent drama knows the clip that got Steven into trouble ([https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1600893111546290177](https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1600893111546290177)). The gist of his argument is that there is a somewhat new trend of streamers, particularly those that are black, of being loud and ""scream\[ing\] at the camera"". My argument is similar to the following one that was posted on the LSF thread of the clip itself (clip is deleted but the comments remain): [https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/zeiyp8/comment/iz75fum/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/zeiyp8/comment/iz75fum/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) . The ""screaming at the camera"" routine is something that has been popular for a while now and, while it may be something that could have different regularities of presentation in different racial communities (not sure of this), it's not uncommon at all.

The trend that is being seen on streaming platforms like Twitch or Youtube is that of very high-energy content creators ""screaming"" at the camera. This is easily summed up by the phrase ""Loud = Funny"", which has seen use for many years before this entire drama and got an Urban Dictionary entry in 2020 ([https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=loud%20equals%20funny](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=loud%20equals%20funny)), which suggests at least some use by then.

If we take a look at some of the largest context creators on Twitch and Youtube, we can see this trend quite clearly. Sodapoppin ([https://youtu.be/jbhZ5VFZFis?t=407](https://youtu.be/jbhZ5VFZFis?t=407)), XQC([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFI6EwtMr88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFI6EwtMr88)), TimTheTatMan ([https://youtu.be/HcKXHl\_0ZLU?t=423](https://youtu.be/HcKXHl_0ZLU?t=423)), IShowSpeed ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYOSVuqVaKc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYOSVuqVaKc)), KaiCenat ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c5h86imuJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c5h86imuJs)), among many others. The algorithm knows what it wants. High-energy, somewhat loud, sometimes angry content is what people want to see and it seems to be doing quite well. Are there many communities that don't follow this trend? Absolutely. However, when we're talking about people who have demographics that are on the younger side, this seems to be a more absolute trend with very few exceptions. 

IShowSpeed in particular is ""guilty"" of this. I haven't consumed much of his content, but most of his more popular youtube videos follow the behavior before with very clear markers for what I call ""young person racism"". This is essentially the ""edgy equals funny"" version of the trend where kids think that saying racial slurs makes for good content. A highly viewed video (17 million views) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzYhmI9Ttt0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzYhmI9Ttt0) of his getting woken up by videos his chat donates while they spam racial slurs in chat is not uncommon. Many communities have gone for this kind of audience before with a lot of social repercussions; think of the entire CX community. The money is there and some can exploit it more easily than others depending on factors like time, place, and, of course, race.

Steven has mentioned before that he doesn't watch many streams so I wouldn't be totally surprised if he has missed a lot of these trends and, considering the makeup of some of the highest viewed streamers on Youtube and Twitch being people that appeal to younger audiences ([https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/5-most-watched-youtube-gaming-streamers-2022-far](https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/5-most-watched-youtube-gaming-streamers-2022-far)) I'm not surprised he came away with this opinion. 

Obviously, I have my criticism of his behavior: just like he's said on stream, I believe he's overgeneralizing a social trend to box in a very common practice to a particular group of people that may not necessarily be completely involved in it. Considering how few streams he consumes, I think that commentary on the trends of streaming isn't something he should be talking about right now. He seems to be more involved in youtube algorithm trends and maybe trends on Twitter where I assume he's gotten a lot of the clips that formed his opinion. 

Hopefully the situation doesn't blow up more than it already has but who knows.",[SHORT EFFORTPOST] Why I think Steven is wrong about the IShowSpeed situation,1670723637,"[SHORT EFFORTPOST] Why I think Steven is wrong about the IShowSpeed situation Anyone that has been up to date with the recent drama knows the clip that got Steven into trouble ([https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1600893111546290177](https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1600893111546290177)). The gist of his argument is that there is a somewhat new trend of streamers, particularly those that are black, of being loud and ""scream\[ing\] at the camera"". My argument is similar to the following one that was posted on the LSF thread of the clip itself (clip is deleted but the comments remain): [https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/zeiyp8/comment/iz75fum/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/zeiyp8/comment/iz75fum/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) . The ""screaming at the camera"" routine is something that has been popular for a while now and, while it may be something that could have different regularities of presentation in different racial communities (not sure of this), it's not uncommon at all.

The trend that is being seen on streaming platforms like Twitch or Youtube is that of very high-energy content creators ""screaming"" at the camera. This is easily summed up by the phrase ""Loud = Funny"", which has seen use for many years before this entire drama and got an Urban Dictionary entry in 2020 ([https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=loud%20equals%20funny](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=loud%20equals%20funny)), which suggests at least some use by then.

Racket isn’t mainstream but it’s certainly useful. Hacker News is built with it and Naughty Dog uses it as a scripting language (it’s easily embedded in C/C++ programs). More importantly, you’ll learn a lot of good practices.

Racket is a dialect of LISP/Scheme(kinda like what C++ is to C). LISP/Scheme and it’s descendants are massively influential. The Scheme wiki says it’s influenced JavaScript, Python, and Rust: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language). 
In a nutshell, LISP is the first functional programming language which is a technique most mainstream languages have been moving towards. The LISP syntax is different than C based languages so learning it early is great. You’ll get familiar with functional practices and become much more based than people like me who learned them later. Racket also has all the tools you need to start making cool shit. Gui, graphics, web server, you name it. All with great documentation to get you going. 

Once you have a handle on it, check out Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (https://youtu.be/t9AZ8_dX6uA). It’s one of the best CS books ever and you can use Dr.Racket with  #lang sicp (https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/SICP_Language.html) to follow along.

You have a great opportunity with this class. Pay close attention and use the docs, Reddit, and discord  (https://discordapp.com/invite/6Zq8sH5) for your own little projects.

I would argue that there are some people with disabilities that have an even worse quality of life than the average child sex slave. Sure, it would be certainly be unpleasant to be raped, but it is probably still better than enduring a life where you are in extreme agony every moment of every day due to a disability/illness/disease.

Therefore, I think its reasonable to say that someone who opposes the right of a disabled person to end their suffering is actually far more evil than someone who opposes the right of a child sex slave to escape the captivity of their rapist. In other words, someone who opposes legalizing assisted dying is more evil than someone who supports the legalization of child sex slavery.

Sure, it would be certainly be unpleasant to be raped, but it is probably still better than enduring a life where you are in extreme agony every moment of every day due to a disability/illness/disease.

Therefore, I think its reasonable to say that someone who opposes the right of a disabled person to end their suffering is actually far more evil than someone who opposes the right of a child sex slave to escape the captivity of their rapist. In other words, someone who opposes legalizing assisted dying is more evil than someone who supports the legalization of child sex slavery.

783,Destiny,"Steven is honestly right about this, stop thinking he needs to always be 100% charitable 100% optics driven, 100% careful in his language every single moment.

first of all Steven is already doing that to an insane degree, he constantly tried to be good faith, nice, and optics driven. in the past few days and weeks (started due to Mr. gaslight and LeahL) he decided to be a little more mean to everyone because god how much can a man handle.   
secondly you expect him to be literally perfect and give him insanely high standards meanwhile you just ignore or completely don't give a fuck about everyone else's standards. I can understand some disparity as we like steven and think highly of him but dear Moses the difference between Steven and Hasan or Vaush is like heaven and earth.

when someone slings shit Steven Slings back. it's how he would ideally act from the countless times he said that's how he enjoys doing it. if someone wants to have a civil argument Steven isn't gonna start screaming at them and otherwise of someone is acting bad faith, screaming, lying and being an asshole then Dman would just love to respond with the same energy.

but the problem comes when this community then suddenly jumps up and says (in soy nerd voice) ""ahhh Destiny why did you say that that was uncalled for and you should have thunk about the ooooptics"". no stfu when Hasan says a big part of DGG are just racists steven can fire back at him saying he visited a sex slave brothel. or he can say he hopes vaush fucking dies because 

**FUCK THEM**

yes fuck them, these pisses of shit do nothing but leech and virtue signal their entire careers while shitting on lying about and just acting like babies about anything related to Steben (keneth bonell 2nd aka destiny aka steven the swastica bonnel).

and no one ever holds them to the same standard as they supposedly hold him to, that we hold for him and that normal people would hold for anyone in this situation.

and the final point is. why do people do it? why do people have this crazy high standard of Steven and they go after him for every little pip he says while Hasan, vaush, Kcent, speed etc can say whatever wild shit they want but no one cares.  
part of it is the views, yes. they are really big and fellow streamers want to stay friendly. but we also see the same behavior in the small lefty content creators. people like Lemon Mama, Loe, P Lunday, Lerric etc.

Stevon was much bigger then all of them yet they had no problem shitting on him, lying and saying whatever crazy shit to smear him. the thing is that Steven does not have dominance. Density is *unthreatening.* on the online space these crazy leftists can cancel you, they can bully you, they can do whatever manner of nasty things they want to knowing they will not ever receive a ""punishment"" for their actions.

and Cuban Man here constantly emphasizes (a thing he was much stronger on this in the past) his policing of the community. how much he shackles the Daliban from actually being an internet terrorist organization.   
we never do any hate raids, mobs, attacks that we do against anyone as a community. unlike the leftospheer who constantly weaponize their community. or people like hasan who just don't give a fuck about a stopping anything and he implicitly encourages his fans to attack others. meanwhile everyone just takes denosity's goodwill and good behavior as granted.

so why wouldn't all these people shit on Destiny? they get everything and lose nothing. it's *safe* to fuck with Steven, but Hasan? oh well suddenly you find yourself blacklisted from any colabes with big streamers meanwhile Stalony doesn't act against you. (in regards to this point I'm glad he is changing, his 30 day ban for anyone hosting \[redacted\]s is a good step.)

I'm sorry, but that's not correct. In mathematics, 1 plus 1 is always equal to 2, regardless of what the numbers represent. The fact that both numbers are raindrops doesn't change the result of the addition.

Me:

AI: 
While it is true that raindrops can combine to form larger raindrops, this does not change the result of the mathematical operation of addition. In mathematics, 1 plus 1 is always equal to 2, regardless of the objects or concepts that the numbers represent. The fact that the numbers are representing raindrops doesn't change the result of the addition.

It is possible to model the behavior of raindrops mathematically, but this would involve more complex equations and principles than simple addition.

However, these equations would not change the result of basic arithmetic operations like addition.

 “In reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself...I see with a myriad of eyes, but it is still I who see.”  
― **C.S. Lewis,** [**An Experiment in Criticism**](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/77261) 

Recently, Destiny facilitated a discussion between several streamers concerning responsible platforming in the context of Stardust's controversial interviews with Richard Spencer. In this discussion, she was criticized for not pushing back on Richard Spencer's ideas but rather ""letting him speak."" This has been a common refrain in the discussion of responsible platforming, which I would argue is fundamentally a flawed criticism. 

The general position typically given on responsible platforming by individuals is usually that it is ok to platform people with ""dangerous"" or ""radical"" ideology if appropriate questions are asked and pushback is given. There are some farther left/right who would disagree with this. Typically, people end up on a spectrum where most would agree that some people should be de-platformed or not platformed by interviewers in all or some contexts (such as positively). However, the scope of who falls under this is hotly contested even among those with generally similar beliefs. There is a lot more that can be said about this debate in general, but I trust that people reading this have heard at least one or two decent debates on the topic so they understand the basics of the landscape.

My own position on platforming is that in the vast vast majority of cases, de-platforming for ideological reasons (what someone believes) should not be a thing that happens. I am a genuine believer in the market place of ideas. However, I would go a step further in that not all platforming of radical or controversial ideologies needs to receive pushback in all specific circumstances. 

My arguments for this are built around 6 central tenants. 

1.) Ideas must be understood well and in their most persuasive form to be argued against well or agreed with. 

a.) As a disclaimer when I say ""well"" and ""most"" I mean ""a good steal man comprehension"" and ""a generally good representation/ argument for the idea."" 

b.)  Ideas that are not in a good form with their best arguments lose their identity as that idea becomes something else the further it strays from its more persuasive form. Thus when you argue against a poor version of an idea you are not refuting the idea.

c.) When the idea does come up in its truer form, people who have no exposure do not have the tools to comprehend it might be wrong. 

d.) If the idea is correct and the labels of ""radical"" or ""wrong"" have genuinely been miss-applied (and no I don't think that's the case for Spencer), than it's harmful to have a good idea be perceived as bad for reasons not relating to the ideas merits. 

2.) Ideas are usually taught/ explained better by their disciples than by their detractors.

a.) In general this seems fairly self-evident as explaining an idea you don't believe in requires a higher mark of rhetorical skill.

b.) There is often a high motivation to make the idea you don't believe in seem worse even subconsciously. 

3.) Pushback, while good in many (if not most) contexts can prevent ideas being shown in their best light. 

a.) While argument/pushback from an interviewer may have value in the vast majority of cases, it can often be important to see ideas from their disciples unfiltered/ uninterrupted to best understand them or why someone might believe them. We would say this for books. You can read a controversial or radical book without someone constantly butting in to tell you what is wrong about the book.  

b.) Pushback if done poorly can obfuscate correct understanding of ideas. 

c.) If some ideas are only platformed with pushback or debate while others are not, it grants an unfair advantage to ideas that may popular at the time, but might also be bad. Imagine for example that racism is really popular in a particular society and that whenever anti-racism is platformed, it is always done so in the context of debate or pushback. This would grant an inherent advantage to a bad idea over a good. A fundamental belief in the a liberal market place of ideas requires not only ideas be platformed but they have some sense of being platformed in non-universally negative light. 

4.) Platforming, pushback, and arguments must be taken in aggregate with an appreciation for diversity of style and method. 

a.) Things like ""arguments,"" ""pushback,"" and criticism are never a part of a single event. They are always part of a giant conversation. Take the example of today. Many criticisms of Spencer were levied from Destiny and friends after his interview with Stardust. These form a larger whole that cannot be seen only as unique events. In the same way, Kanye's interview with Alex Jones really can't be just seen as that interview. It is also part of a massive amount of conversation about the interview itself. 

b.) The strength of the market place of ideas isn't that an idea or concept may win out in a single event even though it is bad or even for a short period of time in aggregate. The concept is that over the long haul, good ideas will beat bad ones. I think the general improvement of the state of humanity and the beliefs of society over the past 20 years is good evidence for this. Think about what people believed in the 90's compared to now. It's easy to look at the world now and say people are crazy. However, in aggregate the lever has moved in a positive direction. 

c.) If non-confrontational or friendly interviews were the only way we saw a bad idea, this would be catastrophic. However, this is not the only light they are seen in. With diversity of content, comes huge varieties of platforming styles. Stardust's interview is just a tiny puzzle piece in a broader whole we engage in. It's generally taken for granted that people aren't convinced by single appearances or debates. It's the aggregate response that is listened to. 

5.) The platforming style should be blind to the ideas themselves. This is to say that if someone like Stardust has a style of platform that she is pre-committed to engaging with, it is okay for her to stay consistent with that style for any ideas platformed. The same would be the case for Destiny. If he is having a debate, he should not have a debate because he is more sympathetic to an idea. His points may change, but style shouldn't necessarily 

a.) Ideas should be put in environments where the best ideas win. I think even someone who believed in radical de-platforming would agree with this. 

b.) If ideas are given exposure to the same kinds of platforms, in aggregate good ideas will triumph. The trouble with pre-determining good ideas and bad ones by people irrespective to a natural selection process, is that it can be pre-disposed to select for bad ideas. It just selects for what's popular without an ability to change peoples minds. Again it has to be asked ""what if the idea that's unpopular is good?"" 

6.) There is some inherent good in enjoyable content, entertainment, and humor

a.) As a default, entertaining/enjoyable content is a good thing. I want that and it is my assumption that other people like content that they/ others enjoy. Thus things like humor or entertainment defaults to good, and the burden of proof is set against the side that wants to say they are bad. 

b.) If (a) is granted, and a large number of people enjoyed Stardust's content, it defaults to good. This means that a measured harm generated by such content must be shown to supersede this not just exist. 

c.) I don't think there is any way that this can be shown. Additionally, the harm from ""irresponsible platforming"" like this is genuinely insufficient to hurdle a burden of proof barrier of the entertainment people get from it. This is particularly true when taken in aggregate with a laissez faire approach to platforming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think a buy in to liberal ideology and democracy at large requires a semi-blind approach to the platforming of the vast majority of ideas. This includes platforming styles. Not just whether or not people are platformed. The question ends up in the same ""who decides who is de-platformed"" place. It should be noted that this extends beyond policies and organizations to influential podcasters and streamers. We all have a role to play on forwarding general human liberal ideology and its continued successes despite the costs.  The quote at the beginning refers more specifically to fiction, but I think it applies here to. It's good to see a myriad of characters and ideas in different lights. It's also good to see ideas in a variety of places, presented in a variety of ways.",Why Stardust is Highly Based and NOT Pushing Back on Harmful Ideas can Constitute Responsible Platforming.,1670620342,"Why Stardust is Highly Based and NOT Pushing Back on Harmful Ideas can Constitute Responsible Platforming.

Additionally, the harm from ""irresponsible platforming"" like this is genuinely insufficient to hurdle a burden of proof barrier of the entertainment people get from it. This is particularly true when taken in aggregate with a laissez faire approach to platforming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think a buy in to liberal ideology and democracy at large requires a semi-blind approach to the platforming of the vast majority of ideas. This includes platforming styles. Not just whether or not people are platformed. The question ends up in the same ""who decides who is de-platformed"" place. It should be noted that this extends beyond policies and organizations to influential podcasters and streamers. We all have a role to play on forwarding general human liberal ideology and its continued successes despite the costs.  The quote at the beginning refers more specifically to fiction, but I think it applies here to. It's good to see a myriad of characters and ideas in different lights. It's also good to see ideas in a variety of places, presented in a variety of ways."

Recently he was on Lex Podcast and I tuned into what was going on on Destiny's channel and there was a stream of drama that I caught up on and thus YouTube was recommending his content to me constantly.

Then suddenly, his content disappears from my recommended flat out, and I learn from Philip DeFranco, that he's in a different controversy.

Destiny has once again showed his outstanding abilities of charitability^TM toward conservatives with his take on the Lizzo Flute business.
 
For those unaware, a while back some musician played James Madison’s flute at a concert and twerked with it at some point. And conservatives, obviously, didn’t like that.
 
But Destiny, for some reason, pretends to have no idea why this could possibly be considered cringe to anyone. It is unimaginable, it seems, why twerking with a historic item might be the slightest bit un-based in some people’s calculation. 
 
“This isn’t fine art.” Destiny says. “Musicians used to be losers. They would’ve been called degenerates too if they were alive today.” 
 
Very true. Yet it matters not. 
 
Certainly, the splattered musings on an opioid-addict’s canvas would not command respect. But time heals all cringe. And many people now *do* respect such people, their art, their belongings, etc. Their cringe is from another time. The least we can do, nowadays, is give all the respect we can to now historic figures and items, as their stories, cringe or otherwise, have ended. Who are we to impose our cringe onto the dead?
 
TL;DR
 
It’s pretty cringe to twerk with historical items, and the fact that Destiny wouldn’t acknowledge that is, itself, pretty cringe.",Destiny’s Conservative Derangement Arc: Lizzo Flute Edition,1670604707,"Destiny’s Conservative Derangement Arc: Lizzo Flute Edition https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB-pyRFJC0E (5:23)

34,Destiny,"People love to jump down the throats of white nationalist, race realist types, etc. who claim that a ethnically homogenous population in a country is preferable to a more diverse population. People often - rightfully so - call them race realist and at times even racist. 

Yet when presented with the opposite scenario where we are presented with the idea that a more diverse population is better than a less diverse population, people don’t seem to realize that the same principle that makes the white nationalist position a race realist position, also makes the pro diversity position a race realist one.

People love to jump down the throats of white nationalist, race realist types, etc. who claim that a ethnically homogenous population in a country is preferable to a more diverse population. People often - rightfully so - call them race realist and at times even racist. 

Yet when presented with the opposite scenario where we are presented with the idea that a more diverse population is better than a less diverse population, people don’t seem to realize that the same principle that makes the white nationalist position a race realist position, also makes the pro diversity position a race realist one. 

That principle is the simple idea that in order to not be race realist, we must acknowledge that there is no significant difference between different ethnicities.

Here's the video:
https://youtu.be/ZX_nnqRSMqM

My analysis:

Max loves framing everything in the judgemental role. Making him the authority figure in the father / child relationship; He's feels like the shitty father (he's used this with lav as well). Then he gives an example of how he would cause his father to get mad at him even though he feared being screamed at, to show how erudite does it to max. Once again painting the father/child relationship.

The whole frame of the conversation is around him judging Erudites behaviour, and why he sees her in this way. Nothing is about how max behaves (Unless it futher puts him in a judge role), because max is the father, always.

This is a highly manipulative domination tactic, the more I see max the closer I lean towards him having apsd.

His long looks at the camera, stoic stare, and even holding back tears when he's feigning emotion are all well crafted to futher the archetype of the father or judge. @notsoerudite

I see Erudite accept the child role I'm this interation, because of her psychology background I have to assume she does so knowingly, to extract more information about max's intentions.

If we're getting meta I think max sees this and this is why he keeps talking about her having one hand on the wheel and how this is ""bad"" and stops her from experiencing their true relationship. Again classic manipulative tactic and way of breaking down her boundaries.

The more I watch the more I see Max exposing his hand.

84,Destiny,"While many people know about the last century of antagonism against the Jews, not many really know the extent to which the Jews were persecuted before the Holocaust. Similarly, not many know the extent of persecution the Chinese experienced in many places over the last two centuries. 

The comparison between the Chinese and the Jews has been made before. In 1914 King Vajiravudh of Thailand published a newspaper article calling the Chinese “The Jews of the Orient”, and that they had excessive ""racial loyalty and astuteness in financial matters,"" as well as ""Money is their God. Life itself is of little value compared with the leanest bank account."". These criticisms seem in line with anti-semitic remarks by… virtually anyone in the last century. Why? Why were the Chinese seen like this? Why are the Jews seen like this? 

Both of these questions have books about them. I’m not going to write another one, but I’ll try and briefly highlight some key ideas and points. 

*Introducing: The Chinese among Others*

Chinese Ethnic Groups:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xsp17b93y19a1.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dc4291656deaf92371c261b12b65a04c9c1319b

The place names are in Chinese, which is not going to be super helpful for a lot of people who don’t speak Chinese - but - I want to point to Fujian and Guangdong provinces, which are on the mainland across from Taiwan. They are inconveniently for my argument not labelled as any particular ethnic group, but there are 3 groups that come from these provinces that are important:

**The Hakka:** Basically a series of groups of people who fled Northern China and went to Southern China, fleeing persecution. They have their own dialect and customs etc, but importantly they’re not really a “geographic group” - they’re not really like “the Celts” or “the Swiss” or some group that has been there for ages. Hakka means “guest”, and they arrived in the southern provinces as “guests”. 

**The Hoklo:** Hokkien is the Cantonese name for Fujian province (opposite Taiwan). Even before China was forcibly opened up by the Opium Wars, people from this area would travel all over Southeast Asia setting up little villages, trading with people and establishing networks. When Chinese ports in the south really got going, the Hoklo began to travel all across the region. They settled in Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and of course, Taiwan. After decades of pseudo-integration they became ethnic minorities in all these places. 

**The Wenzhounese:** Wenzhou is a city in Fujian province. The city is surrounded by mountains, and has a long history of trade. During the Maoist era, the Wenzhounese were forbidden to trade, but often did it anyway. In the 70s and 80s, loads of them began to move to Europe, especially Italy, where they got involved in the textiles and catering industries. Many have become very successful entrepreneurs and businessmen across France, Italy and Germany. 

There is a striking commonality between these groups and the Jews. The Jews also had a diaspora, also were keen traders, also set up trading posts and villages across the world, also leveraged family networks, also were keen financiers. And, as we shall see, both groups suffer similar fates. 

*Introducing: Three Thousand Years of Solitude*

Have a look at the [history of persecution of the Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_antisemitism). It begins in 740 BCE (which is honestly nothing special, the Jews carried out their own atrocities against all sorts of people in the biblical times) and, as the sources get better (and centralised authority becomes stronger) starting from around 1000, starts to **ramp up**. By the time we get to the 1800s we’re getting about 5 - 10 events per decade. These events range from forced conversion to slaughter to confinement in certain places. 

This happened a lot. Everywhere. In England the Jews were occasionally rounded up and taken out to the English Channel, where at low tide there would be spits of land. They would be left on these to drown. In the 1000 and 1100s the Jews in England were forced to keep the King’s financial documents (as they made most of the loans to the Crown). So when the King wanted to have debts disappear, he would order the Jews of Winchester, or Windsor, or wherever, to be killed. In Russia, Catherine the Great in the 1700s ordered the Jews to all be moved to the Pale of Russia (Ukraine, now) and for them to pay excess tax. In Rome, one of the first forms of rent control in the world was for the Jews: a Pope decided they were a useful asset and provided stable accommodation for them in a ghetto (an Italian word). The Jews here were annually taken from the ghetto and ridden by Italian soldiers; when they left the ghetto women had to wear a yellow veil (usually reserved for prostitutes) to identify them; the chief rabbi every year had to petition the Chief of the Councillors to let them live there another year, and the price was a kick to the bottom; they weren’t allowed to build property anywhere outside the ghetto, so built upwards, creating constant plagues. 

The Jews were **despised**. In North Africa, they were constantly raided, enslaved, murdered or mutilated. In Eastern Europe, they were subject to endless pogroms. In Western Europe, they were forced into ghettoes, supplied loans and were regularly slaughtered. 

My point is that the Holocaust **was not actually anything new - it was merely the last, and most coordinated, attempt at the destruction of the Jews** (and loads of others but I’m not focusing on them here). 

*Anti-Chinese Sentiment: “They must be eliminated and destroyed down to the roots”*

The Chinese faced [very similar pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Chinese_sentiment#Historical_acts_of_Sinophobia-led_violence) across the world, but there were fewer of them; they had less time to settle and the fact that they could sometimes return to China meant that they were often less precariously situated than the Jews. 

These pogroms were across the world, but concentrated more in the 19th and 20th centuries. The US had an anti-Chinese exclusion law from 1882 - 1892. Canada and Mexico had anti-Chinese riots and massacres; Australia and the US had riots and massacres. France has had anti-Chinese attacks as recently as 2016. But nowhere were these protests and massacres as bad as in South-east Asia.

Anti-Chinese pogroms have been a regular occurrence in SEA, but the biggest were in the 60s in Indonesia; between 500,000 - 1,000,000 people died, many of whom were targeted because of being of Chinese heritage or ethnicity. In 1969, anti-Chinese riots in Malaysia erupted and rioters roamed the streets shooting people who looked Chinese. 

*Why were the Jews despised? Why were the Chinese?*

The Jews were not allowed to own land - or hold virtually any profession, and Christians were not allowed to loan money **to other Christians**. Importantly, Jews were allowed to loan money (with interest) to Christians. Thus they began to get involved in banking. In addition, the Jews had a strong network throughout Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Asia Minor (Turkey etc). They were often expelled from Europe, but often were allowed to exist more freely in Arab states. They therefore had strong trading networks, where a family member in Constantinople might arrange to have something sent or received by a family member in Granada. This allowed safer trading than trading with non-family members. 

The Chinese - especially the Hoklo - had the same setups. They would have family members across the region, in the Philippines and Java and Bangkok and of course, back in Fujian. There were Hakka mines in Indonesia and these would send money across the sea to Taiwan. The Chinese railway workers in America often would send money home.

Both groups had language issues, and integration issues. Both groups were forced to live in specialised zones in their “host countries”. Both groups had different religions than the majority culture. The Chinese set up “secret societies” and “native place lodges” called “huiguan” which doubled as mutual aid organisations; the Jews had synagogues and other lodges where they were able to conduct religious rites, speak Yiddish and actually openly be Jewish. But… when it was persecution time, these places were often the first to be set on fire. 

The Chinese and the Jews were often set against the “common people” by rulers. The Kings of England would often encourage anyone who had loans with the Jews to gather together and with military support hang the Jews and burn the records. The colonial powers in Indonesia would pit the Chinese merchants and money-lenders against local people to weaken local authorities and become the only source of money or expertise on the island. Both Jews and the Chinese would often work for lower pay than locals, lowering pay for everyone. 

So: economic niches, manufactured antagonism, religious / cultural / language differences all played a role. But what has really cemented this, and still plays a big part today, is culture. The Chinese and the Jews have a few very advantageous cultural ideals:

1. Family and traditional values. Both groups maintain their own culture when in the host country. They often have a different dialect, have specialist schools and have specialist cultural rites and religious practices. This brings them together more, and often creates situations where the family will stay very compact. Hiring a person who is your culture will often produce less friction than hiring someone of a different culture. 
2. Education. Both groups place an enormous premium on education and educational attainment. Both groups place significant value on a few - very highly paid - roles: doctors, lawyers, banking, company ownership. Many other cultures, especially WASP cultures, have placed more emphasis on trade skills, working in a factory, working as a police officer or fireman or a soldier (“just like my father!”). The Jews and the Chinese don’t want to be cops or soldiers, they want to be lawyers and doctors. 
3. Saving. Both groups have been precarious for a long time. Jews and the Chinese save a lot of money, and often have diversified assets. The Chinese often try to own their own homes and their own businesses. Both groups are very entrepreneurial, but also often save much more substantial portions of their wealth. Both groups also contribute to mutual aid associations frequently, meaning they can bounce back from hard times easily.

All of these lead to holding positions of wealth and influence in our society. This exacerbates the other tensions, and leads to pogroms or riots. The cycle continues, and probably will continue, forever. Any group that is “different” and achieves disproportionate power will see this happen. When the colonial powers took over an area, they would often put an ethnic minority in charge. Almost without fail, when the powers left, the ethnic minority was left in a den of wolves, and would be torn apart. The Jews and the Chinese are a perennial example of this situation. 

The recent anti-semitism is a little late, but isn’t unusual. My great-grandparents came from the Pale of Russia after a particularly violent pogrom. My great-grandfather cut textiles with a great pair of scissors and spoke no English, only Yiddish. My grandfather got a phD and my father married a non-Jewish woman. I’ve married a non-Jewish woman. Me or my children may be caught in a pogrom, but hopefully their children won’t be. Looking across thousands of years of pogroms, it seems like the Jews will only be safe when they aren’t Jewish anymore.",The Chinese and the Jews: Similarities between two very different groups of people,1672413946,"The Chinese and the Jews: Similarities between two very different groups of people While many people know about the last century of antagonism against the Jews, not many really know the extent to which the Jews were persecuted before the Holocaust. Similarly, not many know the extent of persecution the Chinese experienced in many places over the last two centuries. 

The comparison between the Chinese and the Jews has been made before. In 1914 King Vajiravudh of Thailand published a newspaper article calling the Chinese “The Jews of the Orient”, and that they had excessive ""racial loyalty and astuteness in financial matters,"" as well as ""Money is their God. Life itself is of little value compared with the leanest bank account."". These criticisms seem in line with anti-semitic remarks by… virtually anyone in the last century. Why? Why were the Chinese seen like this? Why are the Jews seen like this? 

Both of these questions have books about them. I’m not going to write another one, but I’ll try and briefly highlight some key ideas and points. 

*Introducing: The Chinese among Others*

Chinese Ethnic Groups:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xsp17b93y19a1.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dc4291656deaf92371c261b12b65a04c9c1319b

The place names are in Chinese, which is not going to be super helpful for a lot of people who don’t speak Chinese - but - I want to point to Fujian and Guangdong provinces, which are on the mainland across from Taiwan. They are inconveniently for my argument not labelled as any particular ethnic group, but there are 3 groups that come from these provinces that are important:

**The Hakka:** Basically a series of groups of people who fled Northern China and went to Southern China, fleeing persecution. They have their own dialect and customs etc, but importantly they’re not really a “geographic group” - they’re not really like “the Celts” or “the Swiss” or some group that has been there for ages. Hakka means “guest”, and they arrived in the southern provinces as “guests”. 

**The Hoklo:** Hokkien is the Cantonese name for Fujian province (opposite Taiwan). Even before China was forcibly opened up by the Opium Wars, people from this area would travel all over Southeast Asia setting up little villages, trading with people and establishing networks. When Chinese ports in the south really got going, the Hoklo began to travel all across the region. They settled in Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and of course, Taiwan. After decades of pseudo-integration they became ethnic minorities in all these places. 

**The Wenzhounese:** Wenzhou is a city in Fujian province. The city is surrounded by mountains, and has a long history of trade. During the Maoist era, the Wenzhounese were forbidden to trade, but often did it anyway. In the 70s and 80s, loads of them began to move to Europe, especially Italy, where they got involved in the textiles and catering industries. Many have become very successful entrepreneurs and businessmen across France, Italy and Germany. 

There is a striking commonality between these groups and the Jews. The Jews also had a diaspora, also were keen traders, also set up trading posts and villages across the world, also leveraged family networks, also were keen financiers. And, as we shall see, both groups suffer similar fates. 

*Introducing: Three Thousand Years of Solitude*

Have a look at the [history of persecution of the Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_antisemitism). It begins in 740 BCE (which is honestly nothing special, the Jews carried out their own atrocities against all sorts of people in the biblical times) and, as the sources get better (and centralised authority becomes stronger) starting from around 1000, starts to **ramp up**. By the time we get to the 1800s we’re getting about 5 - 10 events per decade. These events range from forced conversion to slaughter to confinement in certain places. 

This happened a lot. Everywhere. In England the Jews were occasionally rounded up and taken out to the English Channel, where at low tide there would be spits of land. They would be left on these to drown. In the 1000 and 1100s the Jews in England were forced to keep the King’s financial documents (as they made most of the loans to the Crown). So when the King wanted to have debts disappear, he would order the Jews of Winchester, or Windsor, or wherever, to be killed. In Russia, Catherine the Great in the 1700s ordered the Jews to all be moved to the Pale of Russia (Ukraine, now) and for them to pay excess tax. In Rome, one of the first forms of rent control in the world was for the Jews: a Pope decided they were a useful asset and provided stable accommodation for them in a ghetto (an Italian word). The Jews here were annually taken from the ghetto and ridden by Italian soldiers; when they left the ghetto women had to wear a yellow veil (usually reserved for prostitutes) to identify them; the chief rabbi every year had to petition the Chief of the Councillors to let them live there another year, and the price was a kick to the bottom; they weren’t allowed to build property anywhere outside the ghetto, so built upwards, creating constant plagues. 

The Jews were **despised**. In North Africa, they were constantly raided, enslaved, murdered or mutilated. In Eastern Europe, they were subject to endless pogroms. In Western Europe, they were forced into ghettoes, supplied loans and were regularly slaughtered. 

My point is that the Holocaust **was not actually anything new - it was merely the last, and most coordinated, attempt at the destruction of the Jews** (and loads of others but I’m not focusing on them here). 

*Anti-Chinese Sentiment: “They must be eliminated and destroyed down to the roots”*

The Chinese faced [very similar pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Chinese_sentiment#Historical_acts_of_Sinophobia-led_violence) across the world, but there were fewer of them; they had less time to settle and the fact that they could sometimes return to China meant that they were often less precariously situated than the Jews. 

These pogroms were across the world, but concentrated more in the 19th and 20th centuries. The US had an anti-Chinese exclusion law from 1882 - 1892. Canada and Mexico had anti-Chinese riots and massacres; Australia and the US had riots and massacres. France has had anti-Chinese attacks as recently as 2016. But nowhere were these protests and massacres as bad as in South-east Asia.

Anti-Chinese pogroms have been a regular occurrence in SEA, but the biggest were in the 60s in Indonesia; between 500,000 - 1,000,000 people died, many of whom were targeted because of being of Chinese heritage or ethnicity. In 1969, anti-Chinese riots in Malaysia erupted and rioters roamed the streets shooting people who looked Chinese. 

*Why were the Jews despised? Why were the Chinese?*

The Jews were not allowed to own land - or hold virtually any profession, and Christians were not allowed to loan money **to other Christians**. Importantly, Jews were allowed to loan money (with interest) to Christians. Thus they began to get involved in banking. In addition, the Jews had a strong network throughout Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Asia Minor (Turkey etc). They were often expelled from Europe, but often were allowed to exist more freely in Arab states. They therefore had strong trading networks, where a family member in Constantinople might arrange to have something sent or received by a family member in Granada. This allowed safer trading than trading with non-family members. 

The Chinese - especially the Hoklo - had the same setups. They would have family members across the region, in the Philippines and Java and Bangkok and of course, back in Fujian. There were Hakka mines in Indonesia and these would send money across the sea to Taiwan. The Chinese railway workers in America often would send money home.

Both groups had language issues, and integration issues. Both groups were forced to live in specialised zones in their “host countries”. Both groups had different religions than the majority culture. The Chinese set up “secret societies” and “native place lodges” called “huiguan” which doubled as mutual aid organisations; the Jews had synagogues and other lodges where they were able to conduct religious rites, speak Yiddish and actually openly be Jewish. But… when it was persecution time, these places were often the first to be set on fire. 

The Chinese and the Jews were often set against the “common people” by rulers. The Kings of England would often encourage anyone who had loans with the Jews to gather together and with military support hang the Jews and burn the records. The colonial powers in Indonesia would pit the Chinese merchants and money-lenders against local people to weaken local authorities and become the only source of money or expertise on the island. Both Jews and the Chinese would often work for lower pay than locals, lowering pay for everyone. 

So: economic niches, manufactured antagonism, religious / cultural / language differences all played a role. But what has really cemented this, and still plays a big part today, is culture. The Chinese and the Jews have a few very advantageous cultural ideals:

1. Family and traditional values. Both groups maintain their own culture when in the host country. They often have a different dialect, have specialist schools and have specialist cultural rites and religious practices. This brings them together more, and often creates situations where the family will stay very compact. Hiring a person who is your culture will often produce less friction than hiring someone of a different culture. 
2. Education. Both groups place an enormous premium on education and educational attainment. Both groups place significant value on a few - very highly paid - roles: doctors, lawyers, banking, company ownership. Many other cultures, especially WASP cultures, have placed more emphasis on trade skills, working in a factory, working as a police officer or fireman or a soldier (“just like my father!”). The Jews and the Chinese don’t want to be cops or soldiers, they want to be lawyers and doctors. 
3. Saving. Both groups have been precarious for a long time. Jews and the Chinese save a lot of money, and often have diversified assets. The Chinese often try to own their own homes and their own businesses. Both groups are very entrepreneurial, but also often save much more substantial portions of their wealth. Both groups also contribute to mutual aid associations frequently, meaning they can bounce back from hard times easily.

All of these lead to holding positions of wealth and influence in our society. This exacerbates the other tensions, and leads to pogroms or riots. The cycle continues, and probably will continue, forever. Any group that is “different” and achieves disproportionate power will see this happen. When the colonial powers took over an area, they would often put an ethnic minority in charge. Almost without fail, when the powers left, the ethnic minority was left in a den of wolves, and would be torn apart. The Jews and the Chinese are a perennial example of this situation.

126,Destiny,"Bulgaria and Romania got critiqued about the same practices recently by EU report, specifically arrests-  Bulgaria and Romania are also among the countries criticized in the report for shortcomings in ensuring judiciary independence.

 state.gov pointed a lot of things related to it too , like : 
https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/romania/
&gt; 
&gt; Significant human rights issues included credible reports of: cases of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government; widespread serious official corruption; lack of investigation and accountability for gender-based violence, including but not limited to domestic and intimate partner violence and sexual violence; and abuses targeting institutionalized persons with disabilities.
&gt; 
&gt; The judiciary took steps to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses, but authorities did not have effective mechanisms to do so and delayed proceedings involving alleged police abuse and corruption, with the result that many of the cases ended in acquittals. Impunity for perpetrators of some human rights abuses was a continuing problem.
 
More about that summary is in the state.gov link at the beginning of the sections / summary /. 

Destiny said  that   these Tate brothers  - the police woudnt arrest them and that this is the special police,  no way its framing them. 

The point is - they still have for what to arrest them -  from such shady persons like these brothers - you can take a lot of money. 

In Bulgaria happent till 2021 very often  - people get arrested, they stay for the maximum 9 months in jail - then get released - and not even a trial , because the prosecutors keep it open. 

--------

Just to clarify - are these brothers framed? Probably not, and im not saying it, just pointing out, this is not FBI with 95% prison sentences and guilty cases.

For example i have an open case being questioned, they took  physical devices -  about ""cyberterrorism"". ( questioned , days later - raided h ome at 5 morning )  - 3 years later - not even a trial started, 3 years ago even the prime minister said this is very important trial, the prosecutors were saying big words on all media and TVs  - 3 years and no trial started, and wont even start. Prosecutors here are disgrace  and totally useless, they just needed to move the prosecution from 1 law to another 1 ( organized crime group ) - based on telegram chats.

157,Destiny," From what I understand, evolution strives to make whatever advantages we develop as natural to us as possible. From a male perspective, evolution made sex feel good so that we would have a strong desire to continue having it and create babies. Evolution has also made it very easy for men to be sexually stimulated, so sexual pleasure feels very natural, which keeps men involved in it.

But in order to even stand a chance of giving a woman sexual pleasure, you truly need to learn, acquire skill sets, and be knowledgeable in her field. Women's sexual pleasure does not feel like a natural occurrence at all and more like something you have to work quite hard to accomplish. I suppose that's because it's not necessary for women to receive pleasure for making babies, which is evolution's intended outcome, but isn't it a little dishonest to place the responsibility on men when it feels like evolution is mostly to blame in this situation? 

Its easy to just say ""men are bad at sex"" but when you really think about it, if men need to be ""good"" at sex, our most primitive and biological imperative, just to satisfy women, doesn't that mean evolution kinda gave women the cold shoulder here?","If it's easy to sexually satisfy a man but takes skill to sexually satisfy a woman, doesn't this mean that evolution selected for men's sexual pleasure and not women's?",1672368213,"If it's easy to sexually satisfy a man but takes skill to sexually satisfy a woman, doesn't this mean that evolution selected for men's sexual pleasure and not women's?

177,Destiny,"Recently there has been a conversation about body shaming following the Twitter debacle between Tate and Greta. I thought it might be a good time to mention “positive” stereotypes. 

One that I think many people will be familiar with, and is somewhat relevant, is black people having big dicks. On its face this may seem like a positive stereotype given that it’s generally seen as a compliment. However, for every black man with a big penis there are many other black men that are average. This stereotype can put a burden on black men that don’t fit the stereotype. Not only that, but this stereotype extends heavily into pornographic material. There are spaces within the porn industry that fetishize large black penises.

I thought it might be a good time to mention “positive” stereotypes. 

One that I think many people will be familiar with, and is somewhat relevant, is black people having big dicks. On its face this may seem like a positive stereotype given that it’s generally seen as a compliment. However, for every black man with a big penis there are many other black men that are average. This stereotype can put a burden on black men that don’t fit the stereotype. Not only that, but this stereotype extends heavily into pornographic material. There are spaces within the porn industry that fetishize large black penises. The fetishization can be taken further when it comes to white women and black men as interracial porn often revolves around cuckold and BBC.

195,Destiny,"Destiny often discusses how most people have inconsistent positions on animal ethics. For instance, most lose their mind whenever someone gently fucks their dog in the ass. Yet many of these same people have no issue with the animal agriculture industry where animals are treated far less humanely. A dog who occasionally gets fucked in the ass by their owner has a MUCH better quality of life than most cows and pigs.

There are of course some people (usually vegans) who hold the position that farming animals and fucking your dog in the ass are both bad. However, even most of these people have inconsistent views on animal ethics. Bestiality usually does harm animals, but it is often less harmful than many other types of animal abuse that even vegans consider acceptable.

For instance, most vegans seem to think it is acceptable to force a horse to wear a saddle and carry some fat fuck on their back for several hours at a time (slavery) but they think its immoral to gently make love to a horse for a few minutes. Keep in mind that horses are able to handle getting fucked by horse cocks, which are far more girthy than that of a human. Therefore, it is hard to imagine that inserting a comparatively tiny human cock in a horse vagina would cause the animal much suffering. At worst, it would be slightly uncomfortable. I suspect that it is still far less uncomfortable than carrying people their back.

224,Destiny,"# Intro

So there has been a lot of back and forth on this recently. Some common talking points I see are:

1. Saying ""small dick energy"" (SDE) is basically the same as saying ""you have a small dick""
2. Saying ""SDE"" has nothing to do with body shaming because its about personality
3. The people that are fine with using SDE are hypocrites and but aren't fine with body shaming are hypocrites.
4. People that aren't fine with using SDE just want to get rid of all insults.

I think that there is a way of looking at this that can provide an answer to all of these points and maybe build a common understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the reason there is such a disconnect on this topic is because of a few concepts:

Implicit vs Explicit

Literal vs Figurative

Societal Understanding

# Implicit vs Explicit

When most people think of insults, we think of a directly attacking a person based on a perceived flaw.

* Example 1: Bully makes fun of a chubby kid by calling them a ""fatass"".

In this case it can be said the chubby kid is explicitly being targeted.

However, because the word itself implies being overweight is bad, it also implicitly targets anybody who is overweight by its nature. This is where the next concept comes into play.

# Literal vs Figurative

While the word an insult uses can be directly tied to the ""perceived flaw"" it is attacking. It doesn't necessarily have to be. The word ""fatass"" can be directly tied to somebody's weight, but it can also be used to describe behavior.

* Example 2: A person of average weight eats 2 slices of pizza at a party when they were only supposed to get one, the person who didn't get a slice calls them a ""fatass"".

In this case, the word ""fatass"" is used not to describe the person's weight, but instead their actions, as being the explicit target. But these are not mutually exlusive. An insult can be considered both literal AND figurative if the target meets the conditions. 

Either way, because of the word ""fat"" is used, the word implicitly degrades anyone who is fat, even if that no longer applies to the explicit target. 

There is one way to change the implicit target of a word and that requires the next concept.

# Societal Understanding

Words only have meaning because society agrees on a meaning, because of this, words like ""cool"" go from being a description of temperature, ""The glass was cool to the touch"" to also being a description of personality/popularity, ""Daniel is the coolest dude I know"". 

This fluidity in meaning can apply  in 2 different ways.

The first is a word losing the quality of an insult.

* Example 3: A black person says to their friend, ""what up my N-ga""

Even though the N-word is meant to implicitly degrade black people, the societal understanding of the word is that, when used by by black people, it essentially means ""dude/guy"". 

the second is an insult not being connected to the original subject

* Example 4: A person calls their friend a ""pussy"" because they jumped after being scared.

Even though pussy is connected to female anatomy, and it implies that a ""pussy"" or vagina is a negative thing, it is understood by society that the insult isn't connected to vaginas or, by extension, women. So while there CAN be an element of implicit shaming, society at large does not see it that way.

# Addressing the Conflict

So using the concepts from before, I want to address the talking points put forth initially.

**Saying ""small dick energy"" (SDE) is basically the same as saying ""you have a small dick""**

*SDE is a figurative insult. It is generally understood as ""you are insecure"". So the explicit target of the insult is the person's personality, not their body.*

**Saying ""SDE"" has nothing to do with body shaming because its about personality**

*SDE isn't completely divorced from the societal understanding that ""small dick = bad"", therefore even though it is implicitly understood as ""you are insecure"", it also implicitly targets small dick dudes and can be considered a form of implicit body shaming.*

**The people that are fine with using SDE are hypocrites and wouldn't be fine with similar pejoratives i.e. ""flat chest energy"".**

*I think the reason people are fine with SDE is because, in the case given, it was implicit shaming rather than explicit shaming.* 

*When most people think of body shaming, the think of an explicit insult designed to hurt a person based on a bodily characteristic they have. It is possible to be against explicit shaming and not mind implicit shaming, even if both can be seen as harmful.*

**People that aren't fine with using SDE just want to get rid of all insults.**

*I thought this myself at one point, but after diving into it with someone else, I think it's more that people that are against using SDE, and insults like it, want to get rid of the implicit shaming.*

*Looking through comments, I've found that most against using SDE would say that words like ""pussy"" do not count as sexist even though there can be an implied connection to women. I think this ties back into the societal understanding of the fact that the connection does not exist.*

*This can be seen in another pair of words ""stupid"" and the R-word. Even though the roots of both words are similar, explicitly degrading mentally disabled people, society has decided that ""stupid"" no longer implicitly degrades them, while the R-word does.* 

# Conclusion

I think that there can be a case made for avoiding implicit harm from body shaming through using terms like ""Small dick energy"". However I think it should be recognized that when we are talking about this type of body shaming, it is not in the same league as explicitly making fun of a person with a small dick.

I think this case is similar to the talks Destiny has had about the use of the word ""rape"". Even though Forcibly assaulting someone in a dark ally, and pressuring a tired spouse into having sex can both be seen as ""rape"", there is a huge difference in urgency and actions between the two when addressing them. And one can be staunchly against one, without necessarily seeing the other as a pressing issue.",[Effortpost]Clearing up the Body Shaming Confusion.,1672348476,"[Effortpost]Clearing up the Body Shaming Confusion. # Intro

And one can be staunchly against one, without necessarily seeing the other as a pressing issue."

I can see why you guys like the game, I enjoy the passing and the struggle to move the ball, and trying to get into position to score. 

However watching that game it just seemed like a very inferior version of hockey. In hockey the game is about passing and getting in position to score. However hockey is superior in every way. It is simultaneously faster and more physical. Imagine taking all the skill and fitness to handle the soccer ball, then do it on ice (faster and less friction) while the ball is 1/5 the size and not ball shaped. And while handling the ball some one on the opposing team can check you into a wall. 


The Question i have is if you eurocucks like soccer so much why dont you like Hockey. And don't give me answers about weather and sweden/Czechia and such. I live in Maryland and it is at a latitude of Spain, sicily, Greece and turkey, and my town is a hockey rink and the Pens and Caps are popular.

247,Destiny,"I was listening to Destiny react to the Kurzgesagt hitpiece video, and heard the common claim made by leftists that global poverty has actually increased in the couple of decades, not decreased.

There are valid criticisms one can make about the way the global poverty rate is measured currently. The international poverty line (IPL) is set to around $2, and is calculated as the average of national poverty lines of 15 very poor countries. This absolute IPL threshold, one could argue, does not take into account that as countries get richer, their living standards increase, as does the value of their basic needs.

The [World Bank](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/stories/societal-poverty-a-global-measure-of-relative-poverty.html) published an article that seems to address this problem by constructing a relative measure of the poverty line, which they call the societal poverty line (SPL). The SPL takes into account the median level of consumption per person of each country, making poverty relative to each countries’ consumption standards.

Looking at the graph from the article, one can see that although the societal poverty rate is higher than the current international poverty rate, it still declined over the last couple of decades significantly. Unless there is some criticism that I’m unaware of, I think this article is a good way to refute the claim mentioned in the title, and support the claim that economic development in the last decades has lead to a global decrease in poverty.",How to counter the “global poverty rate is actually increasing!” claim,1672340975,"How to counter the “global poverty rate is actually increasing!” claim I was listening to Destiny react to the Kurzgesagt hitpiece video, and heard the common claim made by leftists that global poverty has actually increased in the couple of decades, not decreased.

249,Destiny,"So I am with Destiny when he says that the Twitter files have been largely a nothing burger. I have videos where I talk about how crazy the right is for cooming over this. I have read every single twitter file as of last week and only found a few weird things.

The first, in twitter file 6, they talk about how the FBI was reporting tweets for review. I think that is kind of weird. The only thing that would make this not weird is if they only wanted to know if the tweets were foreign or were reporting illegal stuff. I dont like the idea of a government entity using their connections with social media to report tweets even if they do break TOS. But that is what it appeared they were doing. I know twitter files were set up to write a narrative so if there is any information that counters this narrative I would love to know what it is.

The second thing is it appears the FBI rumored, during meetings with the board of safety from twitter, that there would be stuff coming out about Hunter Biden before the NYP article came out. That is odd and there are three possibilities I can think of as to why and how this would happen. But those three possibilities either has the FBI being incredibly lucky and unlucky at the same time, them being horribly corrupt, or them being incompetent.

1. Its possible that they were guessing that something would come out about hunter biden, truly thought the source was going to be foreign actors, and was talking about it with twitter and other social media sites. Burisma was hacked earlier that year so something like that could have made them guess that something on hunter was going to come out, got lucky that it did, and unlucky that it seemed to have come from a legitimate American source instead of foreign actors like they said, making them prime meat for conspiracy theorists. 
2. Its possible they are just incredibly incompetent. They had the laptop for almost a year before it leaked. Now I could be wrong, but to me that seems like enough time to verify the legitimacy of the laptop. Again, I could be wrong. So in this scenario they hadnt verified the content yet, and they knew that Rudy Juliani had gotten a copy (according to the twitter file they were watching him and even made the  claim that he was the target of a russian disinformation campaign). Having not verified the legitimacy of the laptop and knowing that Rudy would most likely leak his copy this could be grounds to rumor that something was about to come out about Hunter. Though, if they had verified the content already then they would have known it was a legitimate leak and that they should not be involved in getting it taken down. I guess its possible they verified the content of the laptop but didnt know what Rudy had, and thinking that he was the target of a Russian disinformation campaign, they thought it was possible he had russian materials. But it didnt appear that Rudy was a target, at least I didnt see any reasoning behind that belief, soo them making decisions base off that could have been incompetence too. I would be interested in knowing why they were talking about the possibility of a Russian Leak involving Hunter Biden and why they thought Rudy Juliani was a target. 
3. The last option is the Right wing conspiracy. They knew everything was legit, they knew it was going to leak, and they wanted to stop it from gaining any traction to help Joe Biden.

The third thing that was weird to me plays into the second. Twitter apparently did simulations of a Hunter Biden leak before it happened. It doesnt look like the FBI was involved in that, but why? It does prove that they were worried about the possibility before the NYP article came out. 

Anyway that is my two cents on it. Any perspectives from DGG that might be interesting? Would love for Destiny to look into this and know what he thinks. Fucking finish Factoria already!!!

So you are 1) eurocuck 2) switch owner 3) haven’t played Disco Elysium. First come first serve, can’t decide this based on sob stories, but would love to see a pic of the game running on your switch if possible

284,Destiny,"Maybe I'm really out of touch or my experience is out of the norm, but I'd say 20k in loans a year is roughly the cost you'd expect to go to an in-state state school. This is including room and board and all the minor additional fees they charge. Also that living on campus and paying for room and board is often REQUIRED until you have 30-60 credit hours (1-2 years). Even after that you still have to have enough money to pay rent for housing near the school and pay for food, unless your fortunate enough to live with family and commute to school every day I suppose. If that option isn't available, near school housing isn't typically much cheaper than living in a dorm (maybe even more), but it does have the advantage of having more space available than a walk-in closest. As for food, unless you plan on surviving on rice and beans (and spending hours a week prepping), or live off dollar menu fast food if it's nearby and destroy your health, the cheapest meal plan is going to be roughly the same cost as getting groceries, and more convenient in terms of time investment throughout the week. Additionally, whether you are paying for the school's room and board or staying off-campus and buying your own food, the cost to do so is well beyond what is reasonable to be able to afford through work alone making $10-11 an hour (what most retail places around me pay, and what I'd make working a job at the school.) If you are able to sacrifice 20 hours a week working and go to school full time, maybe you could bring the debt down to 15k a year. Still, that 20 hours has to come from somewhere, sleep, gym, studying, socializing, relaxation so you don't have a breakdown from stress. 

Also some additional bullshit, to my understanding all loans except the federal subsidized loans start collecting interest as soon as they are payed out. So unless you are fortunate enough to be in a situation to have parent pay towards it or have an extra couple hundred a month to pay down the loan (interest rates % are even higher if all you do is pay down interest or just leave it), add a couple thousand more to your debt at the end.

I'm pretty cynical about the cost of college, if there's anything I'm missing please correct me, or share your experience with paying for school. I still think it's generally a good investment in yourself, unless you're like me and are unable to finish but still left with a lot of debt.

Discord is very interesting, it allows young and old to connect, people of different races, ages, religion, etc.

Quite cool and new and interesting.

It also offers a platform where thus adults can speak to teenagers or potentially younger people.

This is impossible to filter as it's really easy to lie about your age, or because you want to be welcoming towards all ages.

However, aside from the political load around issue. 

About 1 in 20 men is said to be a pedophile.. This number is probably higher when you take into account attraction to teenagers.

I think we must seriously think about the potential of potential misconduct by men with bad intentions (not to be sexist, but yes, virtually all these incidents don't come from women, I think perhaps 1% in the literature).

These man exist, it's not too uncommon, and discord gives them a huge reach..

You saw a smidge of it on stream earlier today (28th Dec). The hormone wash/trans-woman period/hormone induced menstrual cycle *thing*  suddenly appeared again and our lord and savior Destiny brought us the light: Its bullshit. Honestly I'm afraid its a troll. I thought my fellow TRT enjoyers would recognize that its bullshit but I guess being on TRT doesn't preclude stupidity.

For reference: 28 Dec stream: [example](https://youtu.be/eix9TU-60oU?t=7438)

Anyone with half a brain-cell and a smidgen of knowledge on TRT knew this was complete and utter horseshit. It was semi-popular in the panel discourse around trans athletics and the creation of an (OMEGALUL) endocringe category. For anyone who missed it, here are some examples of this white dude (apparently?) named Synth who fancies himself an endocrine expert. Afterwards a few epic contemporaries of D's managed to lock onto this talking point, namely Vaush, and while I haven't heard this for a while, it seems to have gradually involved and entrenched itself in the trans community in some very odd forms as we saw above.

42 minutes in has a few examples: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPss2z6ua1Y&amp;ab_channel=Destiny)

Anyway, 2 or 3 years of hormones will not make you perfectly the other sex, I'm sorry to those deluded if you are reading, but people are talking out of their asses. Unfortunately your prostate will not start shedding blood &amp; mucus like a uterus. However this is not the point of the post. 

Some DGGers (I think probably one of the gym tag losers) and I who are more familiar with the topic noticed this when it started and sent him a few emails on the topic of TRT, its limits, effects, and about the hormone wash stuff. I know he read them because he said so on stream, and probably researched a bit more, because soon after he was more proficient in talking down this specific misinformation. I don't exactly have a clip to prove this but im fairly certain Destiny went from his default, ""Idk man maybe that's true maybe not"" shtick to refuting it in a later panel. 

I've also seen Destiny become more proficient in talking about other topics as well thanks to the knowledge in the community. History in general being one of these topics. I think its easy to see this development considering how absolute shit his history was at one point.

Earlier today, There was a post in which Greta responded to Andrew Tate's childish tweet by saying he has ""small dick energy"", and while I don't like Tate at all, her comment has caused harm to more than Tate if he was harmed by it at all.

[Body shaming is bad because it includes a much wider range of people than regular insults do](https://imgur.com/a/w40lHJm) and is usually based on unchangeable traits. And what I usually get is that ""small dick energy has nothing to do with small dicks but specifically the energy of an insecure overcompensating person"" to which I ask why is small dick energy the symbol for an insecure overcompensating person and not big dick energy? It is because the view that small dicks being bad and big ones being good is near universal in society from all political corners including the ones that are usually against insults based on bodies let alone unchangeable ones. Imagine someone saying black skin energy or gay/trans energy to describe people they hate.

Just a few days ago this subreddit was filled with people asking destiny to be nicer when talking to possible rape victims because his language causes real world harm and today a post body shaming men is the most upvoted post of the day and no other post is even close to it.

It is no coincidence that r/bigdickproblems talks about how to find underwear that fits right and stuff like that while all of r/smalldickproblems recent posts are about how much Greta's comment has harmed them especially because of how viral it became with little to no pushback from leftist, and if you stay for a while you might find one of multiple suicidal thoughts posts that aren't uncommon there.

One of the most commonly given advice to men who feel ashamed of their penis sizes is to not really care because nobody cares about penis sizes but considering how this whole thing happened and how much leftist defend bigoted insults towards them when when the few people who called body shaming out do, just reassures them that is not all in their heads and that the view is still rampant everywhere.

It is always sad to see what leftist think of bald, short and small dick men when one of those things are held by men they hate, just look at how much fun was made of Ben Shapiro's height, Jordan Peterson's voice, Elon Musk's torso memes, Tim Pool's baldness, the guy from r/ toiletpaperusa who's face is made fun of for being small and much more.

Lastly, even if you still don't somehow believe that small dick energy has nothing to do with penises size, you should at least acknowledge that it causes real people unnecessary harm and suffering based on unchangeable traits about them. It is not difficult to be nice. If it wasn't so common to shame small dicks everywhere I bet there would be much more men with small penises opening up about their feelings about the topic but are now bottling it up or moving away from the left and into those who *seem* like they care about them like Tate and Peterson.",[effortpost?] Body shaming men is one of the few things uniting the left and right wingers,1672308160,"[effortpost?] Body shaming men is one of the few things uniting the left and right wingers Before I start I urge everyone to go to r/smalldickproblems and see for themselves the real world harm and suffering this type of language causes vulnerable people.

**Destiny's POV:**
Great sex comes from maximizing what physically feels the best between two people. Learning each other's bodies and preferences, building up trust over time, and having experience and skill with the act. These factors all affect the maximum amount of pressure that can be derived from the partners involved. 


**The average red-piller's POV:**
I have to do most of the work anyway, so her skill/technique is a negligible factor. The hornier I am - the better the sex is. My horniness is linearly correlated to how hot she is. Also novelty is a hotness multiplier because ""ain't no pussy like new pussy""! That's why ""strange"" is a term to begin with.
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=strange


I think when you're younger and don't have a lot of experience, the latter POV makes sense. But once you've seen enough poon, the novelty is not as alluring as it once was. You eventually are less awestruck with cookie cutter hotness. Then Destiny's POV creeps in, and it becomes a matter of min/maxing to derive ultimate pleasure.

I have been nominated as an “Honorary DGGer”, and I want to make the case to all you fine folks as to why I think I am an obvious choice for DGGer of the year.

Before we get into the individual reasons, an important reason right off the bat is the fact that I was labeled an “honorary DGGer”. For too long have us r/Destiny redditors been treated as second class citizens, some sort of pygmy off shoot of the “real DGG”. This is bullshit: we are the real DGG, just as much as the chat if not more so. We create the memes for the Twitter. We’re the ones who conquered r/place. We’re the schizoposters who create content.

Now, getting into the individual, I think I have been a content machine as a DGGer. I have been responsible not only for effort posts, but for high entertainment drama. I have provided content not only for Destiny, but also for some of the most top tier orbiters. 

But, lets stop with the generalities, and lets get into the actual things I’ve been involved with over the past year, in chronological order:

1. [We had me leading some of the original pushback against everyone’s favorite Nazi queen, Mrs. Lauren Southern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/s1q4vt/addressing_laurencnortherns_lauren_southern/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

2. [We had the original post calling out the “So you just want him to be nicer??” defense for Destiny’s Twitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/slqodj/the_oh_so_you_just_want_him_to_be_nicer_argument/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), although it was unfortunately removed by auto mod filters for having the r-word in the title. [However, you can read the original post in its entirety through this recent repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/zvbmna/niceness_a_repost_because_of_looping_and_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), as the issue came up again.

3. We had the [“The Official Demon Mama Guide To Answering A Question”](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/tegotd/the_official_demon_mama_guide_to_answering_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), which went on to be the direct inspiration for the [most viewed video on Rose Wrist’s channel.](https://youtu.be/sGUim80xI-8)

4. We had the [“Fuck Vaush” minifesto](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/ts1nox/fuck_vaush_a_minifesto_on_disappointment/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), an absolutely glorious deranged hate schizopost that ended up being reviewed both on stream and turned into a [Destiny video](https://youtu.be/fVjUCodhmHg).

5. Then of course, there’s the [Nick Fuentes dog whistling post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/u7p2ba/nick_fuentes_irony_and_post_irony_and_why_dog/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), earlier pushback on Nick and exactly why and how he continues to use his style of dog whistles, with pretty locked in evidence.

6. I assisted with the Destiny Vaush manifesto, a glorious success for our great leader.

7. We had the [second debate guide, this time about Mr. Girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/y2tblx/the_debate_guide_part_ii_mr_girl_and_the_chamber/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), being one of the lynch pins in initiating the subreddit war that would produce one of the biggest dramas of all of 2022.

8. Just two days later, your boy came back hard with [a nice “Gotcha” memepost](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/y4ykuv/mfw_when_im_hearing_the_most_disturbing_emotional/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), showing there’s more than just schizoposts to him.

9. We then have the [final, biggest effortpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yhtogd/in_the_land_of_the_gigachad_the_sadboi_is_king/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) of this year, a response to the entire “Is Nick a Nazi” debacle and the questions that came up surrounding it. Although looking back it was perhaps a bit too long and lengthy, I would feel odd leaving it out.

10. Countless comments, responses, and generally being a very active member in this community and subreddit, as it’s a community I genuinely think is quite solid and really enjoy being a part of (DGG for lyfe).

So, if you’ve read all this through, I think the choice to vote for me should be obvious. I will end with a link to the straw poll, and I encourage all of us r/Destiny redditors to show our power and our strength as true DGGers.

There are pros and cons to any career and if you have to add them up yourself. But it isn't unreasonable to make 100k a year doing trade work.   
I have a lot of experience at both ends of the spectrum. I have a couple of degrees and am about to finish an Electrical engineering degree  I can tell you if you join the local union you can eventually make 6 figures.

You will have to earn it, but if you have an IQ of 90 you can do it.   


If you're 18 and unsure about college, I'd consider the reserves in the military and/or get a part-time job at FedEx, UPS, Amazon, etc. You'll at least be able to get some tuition reimbursement and also get the feel for what factory work is like. If you decide college sucks, and it isn't for you then you can join a local union.   


I've worked alongside electricians doing estimates, and I am also getting a degree in Computer and electrical engineering. I can tell you these guys almost get the same pay as I get, and a lot of them know more than me.   


The google pay rates aren't accurate and they tend to be more generous towards college majors. Right now as an entry-level dockworker I make 23 an hour, but I am about to start an internship as an engineer which pays at 24 an hour.  Engineers usually start out making 30 dollars an hour.

If Sneako wants to spread the ""love everyone"" message, why as a non-Jew would he use Nazis as an example?

408,Destiny,"Even though sneako’s argument was silly in this context, what Destiny said was factually incorrect. Briefly listed below are some major territorial changes that occurred only in Europe. These geographic changes were  accompanied by an enormous ethnographic change that fundamentally shaped Europe as we know it today.

Poland:
Pre-War: Poland controlled parts of western Ukraine including Lviv, as well as parts of western Belarus. For reference, Minsk was on the Polish-Soviet border. Most of modern day Poland west of Gdańsk was annexed from Germany after the war. Poland expelled the German population from these areas after annexing them, and renamed the towns and cities to Polish names.

East Prussia:
What is modern day Kaliningrad, was a German exclave in Poland and was substantially larger. East Prussia was bordered in the west by the city of Gdańsk and the Vistula river, and bordered in the south around the area of Olzytn.  Areas of southern Lithuania used to be part of East Prussia as well. 

Germany was portioned into two parts, East and West. Under occupation of (soon to be) NATO and the USSR respectively. Western Germany was portioned in to various occupation zones controlled by the UK, the US, and France. 

Finland lost territory in the winter war against the USSR. Finland’s border used to extend southward to Saint Petersburg.

Albania took over part of Greece.

Italy lost territory that it held in Modern Day Croatia. 

Moldova was separated from Romania. 

This only covers changes in Europe, and does not mention changes imposed by the Nazis that were reversed by the allies after the war (I.E Hungary). There were also immense territorial changes in Asia/Pacific areas.

409,Destiny,"I got a new job a few months ago. My essential function is to design/re-design fracking sites and bring them within concordance of modern environmental protection legislature. Obviously, fracking has negative impacts on the environment, thereby effecting the natural habitat of animals who live in the region, as well as potentially polluting the drinking water of nearby residents. The other day I even heard an NPR radio show about how a town in my state has not had clean drinking water for months.

However, fracking also provides jobs and essential power. We do not currently have the infrastructure to go fully green pretty much anywhere in the nation (that I know of). At least in the immediate future, we need fracking. I do fear, however, that I am doing measurable harm to the world in the meantime. The goal, in my eyes, would be to get away from fracking entirely within 50 years.

Am I destroying the planet until then? Should I feel bad? Should I just ignore my feelings?

2.) Kanye never denied that the holocaust never happened. He just does not believe in binary good an evil. Life is not a disney movie. Putin is neither good nor evil. Pre woke disney even has a quote about this ""Only siths deal in absolutes""

3.) Ben shapiro does [correctly] indeed believe that jews are not a race. Isrealites are a race, jews are not. You can not be racist to jews. That's why the ADL came up with their own word.

4.) History is clearly definitely written by the victors. Thanksgiving / Columbus day are two holidays we've been celebrating for 100s of years without even a second thought. Do you honestly believe those were the only 2 evil things people did in the past an lied about?

In this clip, Destiny is wrong about Elon's comment about having to re-write Twitter's codebase. What Elon is responding to is the ability to increase the velocity of features. To which, Elon replies that a re-write is necessary alluding to Technical Debt. 

In legacy systems, and by all measures the Twitter infrastructure is a legacy system, technical debt impedes the ability to implement new features, due to the legacy design assumptions. Also, some of the original requirements may no longer apply, and further constrain the ability to implement new features, as they need to be integrated in the legacy system. 

Elon is simply thinking as an engineer and is stating the fact that a full re-write would allow him to engineer a solution that meet the current demands and needs of today, unconstrained by a legacy system's implementation - where some portion of the code base is still engineered for the requirements of 2006. 

I speak from experience in the industry, I am a System Engineer for a defence company working on mission critical systems, we can discuss further in the comments.

When I was five years old and living in Zimbabwe my family did not have much, but they were intent on providing me a better life and making sure that I was happy. When I had found a stray cat that I bonded with instantly, I begged my parents to keep it. I did not know at the time that my parents were worried that they may not even have enough money to afford food for another mouth; however, wanting to keep me happy, they eventually obliged. That cat was the light of my life for many years to come.

That is, until the civil war came and trucks full of soldiers rolled into our village. Led by a ruthless warlord name “Destinawabe”, the soldiers immediately started pillaging and imposing terror upon my family, friends, and town members. I hid in the closet with my cat. However, warlord Destinawabe himself knocked down the door to my house and opened the closet I was in. Without hesitation he picked up my cat and shot it in the face. I was shattered. Seeing me cry, Destinawabe exclaimed “ughh are you vegan or something? You better be because if not save me these crocodile tears”. He then went on to explain how raiding my village “wasn’t a big deal” and that this whole thing was a “valuable learning lesson about paying your local warlords”.

Now of course I’m not comparing the murdering of dozens of civilians and my beloved cat and my subsequent enslavement to Destiny’s Twitter etiquette. However, I would say that they are both bad.

Mysogyny, racism, ableism are all hillarious, there is no way around this, but they can hurt as well. We have tried to moderate ourselves while still keeping the funny stuff. Content wide bans have been instituted, with little to no distinction to the nature of the joke. I suggest we change that, collectively. This way, we can keep people happy and call then morons as well.

To this, I offer a few unspoken rules you all (hopefuly) follow in real life and suggest we apply them here. For the purposes of this, think of online shitposting as boxing.

1. boxing ring rule - know your surroundings. Some locations are appropriate to punch someone, others are not. Keep your edginess contained to locations which are built for it. If the content creator is wholesome/profesional - keep their energy in their comment sections. If they are not, lock and load your gamer words.
2. self defense rule - Allow the person who initiated the conversation to set the tone as to what is appropriate. If say, someone starts a reddit post with ""Listen up you dumbfucks,"" they are giving you the implicit go-ahead to shit on them as much as you want. If the other person has not made any such insult, do not introduce it.
3. tap out rule - Always allow the other person to disengage, if they do EVERYTHING STOPS. If they ask (even implicitly) you to stop this conversation, wish them happy holidays and shut your fucking mouth. That being said, any new comment from them offers you the chance to reengage.

bonus: broken arm rule - if the other person is clearly losing their shit, do not pile on them. They probably cannot consent to a boxing match and they cannot consent to internet bloodsports.

Obviously I cannot enshrine these as law, they are open to interpretation and some (3. specifically) would need help from Tiny or mod team to really institute. But, some of us have bullets and we can make small changes ourselves.

bonus: broken arm rule - if the other person is clearly losing their shit, do not pile on them. They probably cannot consent to a boxing match and they cannot consent to internet bloodsports.

Obviously I cannot enshrine these as law, they are open to interpretation and some (3. specifically) would need help from Tiny or mod team to really institute. But, some of us have bullets and we can make small changes ourselves.

I wish you much happiness and gravy in the new year and if you think I am wrong, I wish that maybe next year you grow some braincells that you sorely need."

608,Destiny,"Thank you, Destiny, for pointing this out. The fact is sometimes as a woman, if it’s a situation where you keep telling them no, and they get angry (like break stuff or punch walls to intimidate you), sometimes you do freeze in that situation. Especially when you’re young and stupid, you don’t always realize that they will act like that when they get pushy. I do sympathize with women like that especially if they are naive and young. I agree that it’s stupid behavior but you have to look at why it happens. 

Knowing what I know now, I would simply NEVER put myself in a situation where I would feel physically uncomfortable. I would *never* go to a guy’s apartment like that. But in a lot of cultures and places, these kind of “talks” about relationships and safety are just so taboo.  It’s just not a thing. A lot of relationships are secret and under the radar in a lot of places. And if he’s someone who is also from your culture, you think he understand and will be considerate. So when you first have a relationship? You blindly trust that person and think it’s safe to go to their apartment…you don’t think or realize they will be pushy for sex. Yes, I really just thought it was a great chance for me to cook something nice while we watched a movie or played games or whatever. Yes, I know now that was so stupid and naive of me. So what do you do when that happens and you don’t want to get physical? Or in my case, if you’ve both talked before and he agreed/knows that you are waiting for marriage but he still gets pushy?

He broke a bunch of stuff and threw things and I got scared and I left. Later he did apologize, but after that, I never felt comfortable going back to his apartment. I realize now that I was very lucky, my dumb young self really believed and trusted that he wouldn’t hurt me, but who really knows? If it was someone else, things could have been unimaginably worse. But it was the first time that I was actually scared of him. Even though I was able to get up and leave, many other girls might not feel safe enough to do that.

Here's a flowchart for hanging out with an ex.

-	If you have an ex that was creepy AND/OR you describe as someone you can’t trust – be very careful if you are hanging out with them - probably don’t hang out 1-on-1
-	If you do hang out with your creepy ex 1 on 1 – probably don’t hang out at their place

The goals of Advocacy are to provide clients with unbiased advice and support with legal protections that allow them almost complete confidentiality with a client much like and sometimes exceeding a therapist. They can help with anything related to the effects of SA. They are never meant to make choices for clients, but rather provide them with the range of options and possible outcomes and allow them to choose for themselves. They help make decisions like:

\- If/when to report to police. The risks/advantages involved and the lengthy process ahead  if they choose to report. Communicate with law enforcement/county attorneys office on behalf of the client.

\- Peer and professional support groups, counseling, traditional/spiritual healing resources

\- If it's advantageous for them to get a restraining order against their assailant or if it would pose more risk

\- If they need prolonged leave from college, work, etc

\- medical decisions related to STDs, long-term health, pregnancy, evidence collection

\- Services to increase anonymity like name changes, legal address changes and accompaniment to all court proceedings

And these are just some of the many. Sexual Violence can affect someone's mental health, living situation, and life's plans in a myriad of ways.

When presenting all the options and services available the one thing I never bring up as part of the plan was the option of **publicly disclosing your trauma on social media.** Advocates absolutely encounter survivors who wish to make that choice, and with survivors who already have and are **dealing with the fallout**.

# The #MeToo Moment

When #metoo happened in 2017 and led to the eventual downfall of Harvey Weinstein survivors saw a lot of hope in that situation. For the first time they were able to reach across industry silence and an abusive system of cover-ups to create enough public outcry that led to justice either legally (Weinstein) or by society's rejection of them (Kevin Spacey). It was also a large scale opportunity for people to share with each other that they also were a survivor when most people lived with that in secret. It was humanizing to see how many around you were affected and how truly not-alone you were.

The outcry of support and feeling of community is what people remember most about this era, when those speaking were so many it wasn't as daunting to bring your trauma out in the open. Dissenters were shot down and survivors were able to share in a really empowering moment online. 

Though survivors should feel welcome to share their experiences on their own terms and there should be ample opportunity to do so, the reality is that the #metoo hashtag was still a movement based in social media. Like all hashtags, the shelf life of it was short and sweet. Now that we are outside the #metoo moment, the landscape for public disclosures has returned to being rocky as usual.

Skepticism of the justice system is high and with good reason. With it being revealed that many states have a backlog of sexual assault kits they've [not even tested](https://www.endthebacklog.org/#explore_backlog_map) and the unlikelihood of assaults going to trial let alone [providing consequences](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/18/nyregion/manhattan-da-rape-cases-dropped.html) for assailants it can feel like your options are limited.

So why do I bring up #Metoo? Because when people encourage or consider public disclosures, I think this is what lives in their mind: a wave of unquestioning support from likeminded people where before you felt very alone.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why Public Disclosures Are Bad, Actually

1. **They discourage lower level conflict resolution**

Humans are naturally conflict avoidant. It can be tempting to resolve negative feelings or memories that are sexual in nature by seeking public validation, rather than face the social consequences and ickiness of removing that person from your life or speaking to them one-on-one. Without these discussions, it leaves much up to interpretation and can lead to misfiring on the [wrong person](https://youtu.be/Y-yTqBstuds) when a conversation would have sufficed. What's worse is if you bring a public allegation that the public deems not worthy of such a reaction, any future claims you make will be discredited. Leaving someone even more vulnerable to sexual violence and being disbelieved is not a good outcome in any case. I wonder if in the wake of Arianna's situation with OTK, if the current one could have been resolved behind the scenes without anyone's credibility being questioned. 

**2. The crush of questions after the wave of support**

When people look back on #metoo they remember endless tweets of support to survivors, but not the endless questioning that followed. #Metoo is an unfair representation of what its like to bring claims forward when yours is the only one. Suddenly your trauma becomes an avatar for situations others have encountered, and you find yourself in a position to either take harsh criticism or defend yourself by providing more invasive detail. Destiny is correct in saying that it isn't the internet's responsibility to coddle you. All the yasskweens and validation in the world doesn't take away the sting of the doubts and criticisms, and people revealing such personal information aren't in a headspace to take constructive criticism about their victimization.

You also can't prevent the weirdo actions people will take when they think they are ""supporting"" you. I've seen survivors who have had their cases discussed publicly in the media who have then had picketers outside places they were assaulted or use their story for social media campaigns to show ""support"" when really it's just triggering to have to see that every day. 

**3. It leaves survivors open to legal action**

Depending on what a survivor says or how they say it, perpetrators can take legal action against their accusers that can be life-changing even if it's not criminal in nature. I've seen more than a handful of such disclosures end in the survivor getting a restraining order granted against THEM because their disclosing and support of that disclosure on social media is deemed harassment. These judgments again leave a survivor more vulnerable to being disbelieved in the future as anyone sees the restraining order and assumes they were in the wrong. Restraining orders can also force a survivor to have to change jobs, schools, travel patterns and dwellings.

**4. It can have negative consequences for further criminal action**

It is also human nature for people to seek community when they are going through something difficult. It's common for survivors to want to communicate with victims of the same perpetrator and commiserate over their experiences in a way others could not. Unfortunately, such things can be viewed as collusion between victims and can be used to discredit them. Even advocates occasionally have had their records subpoenaed if they serve more than one survivor of the same perpetrator, in an effort to accuse the agency of encouraging collusion.

# What have I told survivors seeking advice about publicly disclosing their trauma?

What I asked anyone disclosing, whether publicly or privately, was ""what is your purpose in disclosing? Is it because it will make **you** feel freer having it out in the open? Are you doing it because you will feel healed by it?

Or are you doing it because you think it will protect other people (with no guarantee it will and at much personal risk)?

Are you doing it because you're hoping the reaction you get will be healing (even people who love us can deal with information like this very negatively)?""

If someone was putting themselves out there because they thought the response was going to validate them, I always provided my clients with the reality that the negativity will always drown out the support in their minds, no matter how small. That no one is owed their story, and that even formal police reports don't guarantee you are saving any future victims from harm. There is a reason SA Advocacy agencies have worked so hard to provide and maintain confidentiality: Anonymity is fucking based, actually.

If anyone is considering disclosing trauma on any level, I encourage them to reach out to [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/resources) which is the National Sexual Assault Hotline. They can provide immediate support and connect you to an Advocacy organization in your area that is more familiar with how the system works near you. Advocates will never tell you what to do, they will provide you with options and a real-life view of possible outcomes so you can make informed decisions about how best to handle your situation.

635,Destiny,"I can empathize with Destiny a million percent on this one, even if I don't really agree with his position.

So here's the problem with what he said.  The energy coming off of him feels more like ""fuck that girl for getting raped"" rather than ""fuck that rapist for raping her"", and that's why everyone's upset about it.  And it makes sense to be, because that sounds like his priorities are fucked up.

But to him, everyone knows rape is bad.  It's not interesting to just talk about how rape is bad.  There are a million other people saying ""fuck that guy for raping her"".  Him just echoing that position would add nothing to the conversation. But meanwhile, there's pretty much nobody pointing out ""actually her behavior here was bad too and we should be pointing it out (and maybe even shaming her for it) so people don't keep doing that behavior"". So he points that out. But then suddenly the ""rape is obviously bad"" circlejerk detects someone going against the grain and instantly turns against him, thinking he's running defense for a rapist.  So then he goes on the defensive and gets increasingly more aggressive the more people fight him on that point, because he knows he's right about it.

Nothing about this is surprising if you've watched Destiny for any significant period of time. I'm not necessarily saying it's good or okay, but once you understand that he just dislikes circlejerks, then you don't need to resort to these nonsense ""Destiny is just intentionally trying to get people to hate him"" or ""Destiny just thinks being nice is soy"" arguments.

So he points that out. But then suddenly the ""rape is obviously bad"" circlejerk detects someone going against the grain and instantly turns against him, thinking he's running defense for a rapist.  So then he goes on the defensive and gets increasingly more aggressive the more people fight him on that point, because he knows he's right about it.

Nothing about this is surprising if you've watched Destiny for any significant period of time. I'm not necessarily saying it's good or okay, but once you understand that he just dislikes circlejerks, then you don't need to resort to these nonsense ""Destiny is just intentionally trying to get people to hate him"" or ""Destiny just thinks being nice is soy"" arguments.

If the rest of the world was saying ""fuck that girl for being so stupid"", he'd be defending her and directing more of his aggression on the guy, 100%."

648,Destiny,"Destiny has stated several times on stream that the aspect that he hates most about his community is that we can't just disagree with someone instead we become hyper-aggressive and insult/hate them. After the discussions over the past while regarding his tweets, it seems to me that that aspect of the community's behavior is an emulation Destiny's aggressive tone when he engages with people on other platforms.

While I think Destiny himself can just disagree with a person and that his tone in twitter is him being mean for his own fun, he clearly doesn't think that is always the case for chat, and I agree. Chat can adopt superficial behaviours from Destiny for better or worse, regardless of whether they share the same underlying feelings Destiny does. Destiny recognizes this much given his anti-misogyny arc. Destiny had fun making women-related jokes because he knows he isn't misogynistic, however chat begins to latch on to the behaviour, and for some chatters it isn't a joke anymore. Destiny recognized this and adjusted his behaviour and the community to try and reduce that. 

Chat is a reflection of Destiny's behaviour, though not intent. We characterize parts of Destiny behavior that are hyper aggressive to the point of comedic (Nebraska Steve, twitter Destiny etc...), but then some adopt this ""Gigachad"" persona as a way to act normally.

655,Destiny,"Destiny's recent comments about Elon Musk are very subjective and he seems to have lost his calm and reasoned approach to evaluating the situation. Here are a few points I think that Destiny is wrong about Elon Musk

&amp;#x200B;

1. Elon Musk has improved the health of Twitter by reducing a significant portion of its expenses. Now, considering he's only been there a few weeks, cutting down so much overhead without the companies falling apart. Meaning, he must have had a lot of experience in running a tech company to know where its ok to cut from and where it isn't. 
2. Destiny is forgetting that when you lose advertisers, other advertisers replace them. If Twitter has a lot of eyeballs on it, especially now when it is arguably very popular, then someone would pay to advertise on it. Destiny is talking about Twitter losing advertisers as if it's a permanent thing. Even if the loss of advertisers causes the price of placing an ad to go down, someone will still pick that offer up. 
3. Destiny thinks that ""technical debt"" is a buzzword. It most certainly is not. Mature companies that have been around a while, accrue technical debt and that makes it harder and harder to release new features needed to increase revenue as well as make the system more fragile and difficult to maintain. Elon Musk did not outright say that he wants to redo the whole stack in order to fix it, but some rewrite in some specific module or microservice might well be needed. A rearchitecting of some parts of the system, may well be needed for Twitter to them develop at a much faster pace. 
4. Mentioning Tesla's stock going down is not an objective claim to make against Elon Musk. Prior to the lockdowns, the FED printed 41% of the dollars in circulation. Those found their way into assets and onto the stock markets and inflated valuations. That is why you say stock prices on the S&amp;P 500 go up 35% while half the country was in lock downs where you would have expected them to go down. This is why you would see progressives say that all the richest people in the world doubled their ""income"" (when it is actually the valuations of stock they hold) during the lockdowns while everyone else was suffering at home without money. Now, with the FED tightening easing, those valuations are being corrected. Most stocks are down, especially tech-stocks. Now, you can make the claim that Elon Musk's behaviour on Twitter is making Tesla stock go down a little bit extra than normal, but you will have to also except that the actual company is performing quite well on delivery as well as research. 
5. Lastly, Elon Musk has so far owned 9 companies. Most of them have done well and a fair number of them are in tech as Twitter is. You can make the claim that social networks are a different animal and I would not argue with that point, but to say that he has no clue what he is doing, shows a bias and lack of understanding from those who made that claim. Elon Musk understands developers, he understands the technologies, he understands where the tech should be or should be aiming to be and he has a very good understanding of the financials. I would say that he needs a better and clearer policy for moderation on Twitter and that would ease a lot of the 'people issues' and on that side, he could be doing better. But there are not many people on this planet that take over a $44billion company and hit the ground running.

656,Destiny,"Destiny has often said no one should have a say in what happens with their child besides the parent, the child, and the doctor. Essentially, he is comfortable saddling a child with the (potential) consequences of a decision that will have lasting effects on that child's life.

if you would be comfortable allowing a 13 year old to make irreversible changes to their body, why don't we also force them to decide their career paths that young? It's not a 1-1 comparison, because I'm sure many people have changed their career path. Then again, it's much easier to change your major than it is to have breasts surgically removed because of hormone therapy at a young age.

If you are going to take the position that a child can make a decision about the gender they want to present as, surely you would support that child being able to get tattoos that are, potentially, for life. If there were a career path program that is potentially permanent, surely you would support a child making that decision as well. A child can be aware enough of their gender you would support medical intervention, but picking a job is too much?

The reason we never hold children to the first career in their heads is because they aren't at a stage in their lives where they can speak on who they are yet, or what they are/want.

DGG can't make streamer man nice

Good criticism, but still no nice to be seen for miles

Its pretty obvious. He don't wanna be saved.

Every single post outside of the genuine critique filled effort posts only seem to succeed in getting people banned and producing shit arguments that consequently miff Destiny instead of changing his mind. 

On a another note this whole thing has been instilling in me a lack of care towards the victim, perpetrator, and overall the case itself. Every post is just about Destiny, which we'd expect given this is his sub. However the glaring issue is with all these shitty leddit ballads in which each and every heartbroken community member feels liable to lament about D's lack of ""niceness and tact"" which reeks of the most soy self-absorbed (and legitimately) parasocial shit I've seen thus far in the community.  

I might even make the argument that the discourse slightly aligns with Destiny's point.

663,Destiny,"I have no idea why Destiny is so interested in calling this rape victim stupid but I will go to bat for him here:

She has said that she had no idea that her “friend” Rich was capable of rape, and that people (Destiny and OTK simps) calling her stupid are expecting her to suspect all men of rape. 

https://twitter.com/azalialexi/status/1606071868531675136?s=46&amp;t=uZjtMWmQZVbPPQHV5uO5yg

The problem is that in this situation Rich DID rape. Destiny is not suggesting that all women suspect the 18 year old Eagle Scout Mormon kid of being a rapist just because he’s a man. But just as we can look at a person who refused the covid vaccine during the Delta surge and ended up in the ICU, we can look at times when bad outcomes occurred and analyze whether or not the victim could have seen this coming or prevented it. 

Rich is a fuck boi who was only interested in the victim for sex. Rich heard her give clear signals that she’s not interested in sex and still started jerking off without her consent. In a different reply, she mentions this is not the first time he’s jerked off in front of her without her consent. 

These are obvious red flags and we should live in a society where most women are concerned about the threat of rape in the above situation, not because Rich is a man, but because the pattern of behavior, the situation and the dynamic is highly troubling. The fact that she was raped is tragic and unacceptable but it should not have come out of left field to someone who is clear headed about the situation. 

I think many people will implicitly connect calling a victim stupid to believing the rapist is not fully culpable or the victim in some way “deserved” to be assaulted. I don’t believe that Destiny believes those things. People can be stupid and still not deserve the bad things that happen to them. But we can still call them stupid in order to help others avoid the bad outcome. In fact that is one of the benefits of the me too movement, not just exposing predators but also showing the situations that women find themselves in before they are raped so women can avoid them in the future. 

Nobody who refused a vaccine deserved to die of COVID, be we can still call that dumb if they were old, had comorbidities and we know that in the end they DID die of Covid. 

Azalia did not deserve to be raped. But she was vulnerable, she was in a bad situation, she was with a rapist and while she could not have known she definitely would have been raped, she could have suspected that was a possible outcome of the decisions she made that night and what she already knew about Rich. She could have been smarter and decreased the amount of rape victims in the world.",Response to “women shouldn’t have to treat every man as a rapist”,1672038677,"Response to “women shouldn’t have to treat every man as a rapist” I have no idea why Destiny is so interested in calling this rape victim stupid but I will go to bat for him here:

She has said that she had no idea that her “friend” Rich was capable of rape, and that people (Destiny and OTK simps) calling her stupid are expecting her to suspect all men of rape. 

https://twitter.com/azalialexi/status/1606071868531675136?s=46&amp;t=uZjtMWmQZVbPPQHV5uO5yg

The problem is that in this situation Rich DID rape. Destiny is not suggesting that all women suspect the 18 year old Eagle Scout Mormon kid of being a rapist just because he’s a man. But just as we can look at a person who refused the covid vaccine during the Delta surge and ended up in the ICU, we can look at times when bad outcomes occurred and analyze whether or not the victim could have seen this coming or prevented it. 

Rich is a fuck boi who was only interested in the victim for sex. Rich heard her give clear signals that she’s not interested in sex and still started jerking off without her consent. In a different reply, she mentions this is not the first time he’s jerked off in front of her without her consent. 

These are obvious red flags and we should live in a society where most women are concerned about the threat of rape in the above situation, not because Rich is a man, but because the pattern of behavior, the situation and the dynamic is highly troubling. The fact that she was raped is tragic and unacceptable but it should not have come out of left field to someone who is clear headed about the situation.

I’m reposting it now because I’m seeing a bunch of the same shit arguments used to defend Destiny here, especially the “He’s technically right, but you want him to be nicer!”. It might be lazy to just do the repost, but considering it’s the exact same arguments, figured I’d give it the same response. 

I've seen this again and again, and this argument annoys the fuck out of me. It seems like as long as you can find some much more modified, toned down agreeable statement that seems similar enough to the initial take, we can say whatever offensive, caustic statement we want. The problem is how we say this, the emphasis on what we say, and a willingness to actually communicate it in a productive way are as important, if not more important, than the actual take itself.

To highlight this, I am going to give you a little example. Indulge in a thought experiment for a second with me: I'm a left of center streamer, with a career similar to Destiny's:- I've argued against the far left and the far right, and I'm known to be a little edgy at times. One day, I'm really feeling myself, and so I decide to tweet out:

&gt;Stupid fucking n\*\*\*\*\*\* need to stop shooting each other, stop glorifying drug addicted deadbeat dads, go to school and get a job

(only without the asterisks)

(***EDIT***: To be clear, because I've seen a lot of people getting confused on this. I am not saying this tweet is a 1:1 to Destiny's tweet, or that I think this is the level of inflammatory shit he engaged in. My point with discussing this tweet is to show that even the basic ""Oh so you just want him to be nicer?"" argument can be used to dismiss any criticism of even a tweet like that. This is also not to say you can never disagree with an optics argument or think it's a frivolous criticism, but I made this post because I was very tired of seeing this used repeatedly as a cudgel to dismiss all criticism related to presentation, tone, context, etc)

People get very upset on Twitter, immediately enraged. For some reason, even though I know they agree with my actual take, they're all blowing up because I didn't say it nicely enough. So I send out another tweet explaining the tweet above:

&gt;What is so controversial? I'm saying that if we want to reduce racial inequality, we need to dismantle racist structures that produce environmental factors that naturally lead to crime disparities and the average black child not having the same educational opportunities as the average white child. In addition, I think it's important to make sure that black children not only have an environment they can succeed in, but positive role models that push them to succeed

After this, I start having people on my stream, and whenever they say the tweet was fucked up, I go through this dialogue chain:

Me: So you disagree with my take that there are racist elements of society that produce bad environments for black people?

Them: No, I just-

Me: Oh, so do you disagree with me that it is helpful for a child to have a positive male role model who emphasizes the importance of education and gives them a good home life so they don't go towards destructive behaviors?

Them: No, I just uh-

Me: Oh, so you don't disagree with my take at all. You just want me to *be nicer about it.*

**If they bring up that it's not just nicer, that maybe the language is so offensive that it could be seen as actually harmful:**

Me: Wait, so is there like a black adult who's gonna get super traumatized by seeing a tweet with the word n\*\*\*\*? Look, maybe there is, I don't know: but I'll tell you what, if you're so sensitive that one tweet with the n-word is going to like traumatize you, don't go online. People are gonna be mean on Twitter, if you can't handle that then like I don't know, get yourself a caretaker and stick to watching Blues Clues or some shit.

**If people say that my tweet is racist:**

Me: Okay, so putting aside that I've literally argued against race realists, I would say that someone like you is actually creating a more racist world. What you're saying is I can't even bring up the issues that we need to fix, and it's people like you that prevent the discourse from actually progressing. It's important that we not only do need to recognize that there are factors, but there are good and bad behaviors people can engage in, including black people. They have agency too, we're not gonna anywhere treating them like they don't.

**If people say I'm not acknowledging the negative factors here:**

Me: Of course I am! What, do you think I think racism is good? Do I need to preface every tweet with ""RACISM BAD""?!  It's so fucking boring that you can't just say something without putting a million fucking disclaimers before it.

**Conclusion:**

If Destiny posted that initial tweet, I'd want to be able to criticize it. I'd want to be able to go ""What the fuck dude? This is a horrible, completely unproductive tweet!"" But as I showed above, even a tweet like that can have an explanation given after that is technically a take I don't disagree with, and all of the issues I'd have with a tweet like that could just be (as I've shown) shoved under the general rug of the dumbfuck ""You just want him to be nicer"" argument.

So, to all the idiots out there that continue to give that shit argument, keep giving it if you want, but just understand that the bullet you have to bite is basically saying that there's almost nothing you could ever criticize him for, including the tweet above. And every progressive tweet that you allow to be defended with that ""You just want him to be nicer, but the take is good"" dumb shit argument, the more and more we erode the value of actually communicating in an effective way.

And putting aside anything moral about giving a message that generates splash damage to basically any woman who's ever been in a situation where they felt unable to speak up, or putting a random rape victim's tweet at the center of a public controversy, this does have real damage to Destiny's brand and his ability to grow his platform and message effectively. Every one of these extremely poorly communicated tweets is not only a barrier in terms of just seeming to send out a toxic message (and one that others will gleefully play into), but it also raises the question of ""If this dude doesn't even know it's a bad idea to make this take, why the fuck would I ever listen to him on anything of substance?""

Destiny's a smart dude. Smart enough to know the issue with these things, and smart enough to know the ""So you agree with the take but I could have been nicer"" argument is an awful one. I'm not gonna treat you guys like retarded children by continuing to accept it without pushback, and I don't want you to treat him like a retarded child by enabling him through continuing to parrot it all through the sub.

697,Destiny,"Hey Merry Christmas everyone, today were going to be talking about genocide.

Destiny and Pixies recent conversation really got me thinking and I wanted to talk about what both of them and Vaush seem to miss when talking about the so called ""trans genocide."" To be explicitly clear I want to have a discussion about commonalities between our current situation and real genocide that has happened in the past. The binary conversation of whether or not a genocide is happening right now in the US is not interesting, but we can address some of the things LGBTQ+ find worrying in recent years and how this compares with other situations. 

Firstly I will be using the UN definition of genocide:

&gt;*In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Killing members of the group;*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.*

Note that it is still debated whether or not sex or gender identity should be included in the definition. (in which it probably should)\*

Destiny explicitly said in his recent conversation with pixie that intent should be factored in when deciding if something should be labeled a genocide or not. My understanding of Destiny's position regarding why the treatment of trans people in the US is not genocidal is:

'Trans people are not being killed in mass, neither are children being removed from the group and taken to another group. Whether or not we regress in trans rights isn't indicative or genocidal intent of the majority of the population and we would likely continue to progress in trans rights even if we backslide.'

He also said that labeling it a genocide by Vaush and the likes has to do with drawing attention to the issue. 

My issue with this position and the nuance that can be found between the two is that actions that the majority group takes against a minority group can be labeled as genocidal but that doesnt mean that a genocide is taking place yet. To further elaborate, a genocide usually doesnt happen out of no where, the decisions and social conditions leading up to a genocide involve stretching what is socially acceptable to eventually encompass genocidal actions. For example, a simple law in Weimar Germany such as 'Jews not being allowed to own dogs' are very much apart of the genocidal process because the process of genocide involves pushing normal people-that would otherwise not be okay with genocide-to eventually become okay with smaller and smaller actions that all contribute to a genocide and eventually become a genocide.

Don't believe me? Well Three Arrows makes a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8UzmLsXGRU) elaborating on this subject. Ill summarize a bit of it here. The court psychologist at the Nurnberg Prison [Douglas Kelly](https://www.minnpost.com/mental-health-addiction/2014/04/men-and-monsters-nazi-and-psychiatrist-explores-one-historys-most-tr/), argued that the leading Nazi officials (such as Hermann Goring, and Adolf Eichmann) did not all have a common psychopathic personality trait. In fact it was quite the opposite. He found that these people were actually pretty normal (granted you could argue the reliability of the Rorschach inkblot test).

&gt;*From our findings we must not only conclude that such persons are neither sick nor unusual, but also that we could find them today in every other country on earth. -Douglas Kelly*

You can read more about Douglas Kelly and Molly Harrower [here](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/03/nazi.html).

This of course isn't definitive but it elaborates more on something more important. Most of the Nazi leadership and SS were sane. We could even go as far to argue that genocides like the holocaust can happen anywhere and it doesnt take a bunch of insane people to orchestrate one. Racist propaganda itself isnt framed as something you should take pleasure in, but something that is necessary. 

This leads us to now, where conservatives in the US probably dont hate LGBTQ+ people (although there are a lot that do) but when it is framed that such individuals are ""grooming our children"" we could see a potentially bad situation where people aren't taking away the rights of other people for fun but because they believe it is necessary. This is an element of the process of pushing what is acceptable to say we saw in the 30s and 40s, which did lead to an eventual pushing of what is acceptable to do. 

However people like Vaush who go out of their way to fearmonger when we have made massive progressive gains for LGBTQ rights in recent years aren't doing trans people any good either. They are absolutely making it worse. There is not a genocide going on right now in the US, but we can see similar parallels of events leading up to atrocities in the past. History doesnt repeat itself but it does rhyme. 

So just be cautious, when people say there is a genocide going on. They are out of touch with reality, but also be cautious of the recent legislation proposals by conservatives, and rhetoric about ""child grooming"" in which we can see there could be a bad situation brewing. 

All of that being said considering the Conservatives seem to have underperformed in the recent midterms it can also be said that this rhetoric isn't effective. That could for sure be argued. To be extra clear I dont necessarily disagree with Destiny, but I think we can have a more nuanced opinion and more interesting conversations about this. 

Next Destiny also argued in that recent debate with pixie that if there is a current genocide of a group of people its absolutely justifiable for most actions against the genocidal group. Ethically speaking, I do not have an issue with this (even though you could argue it would lead to a worse outcome). My issue comes in when you continue to extrapolate from this perfectly fine take to a pragmatic situation where a certain minority group might have the option to defend itself from an oppressor group. 

[Here](https://youtu.be/TWKF8Rk8k9g?t=1577) Destiny argues that in that situation it would be justifiable for Jewish people to defend themselves from Nazis. Although ethically it is justifiable, we cannot continue down the line of argumentation that conservatives would go down saying ""well the Jews could have stopped the holocaust if they had been armed and willing to fight."" Its highly unlikely Jews could revolt successfully against a regime in which most of the population was okay with, and that entire armies were losing too. It wasnt even until the end of the war when the French resistance actually started to make issues for the Nazis. Not to mention in 1938 a Polish Jew named Herschel Grynszpan had shot a diplomat which sparked one of the most vicious crackdowns and mass hate crimes on the Jewish population [(Kristallnacht or the night of broken glass)](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/kristallnacht). Knowing this Pixie's argument becomes a lot stronger; that violence against an oppressor group could lead to worse circumstances for minority groups. However there is a nuanced position we can take here. The Jews had every right to defend themselves against the Nazis, but it was unrealistic to say they could have stopped the genocide (which again i want emphasize isnt Destiny's argument, its an extrapolation people like [Ben Carson](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/oct/26/ben-carson/fact-checking-ben-carson-nazi-guns/) want to sell you for political gain). We could even go as far to say that in a lot of circumstances the Nazis were looking for reasons to commit hate crimes and push increasingly genocidal actions. This Rhetoric people like vaush even hint at is very dangerous in our current political climate. 

Overall I dont think in this discussion Destiny is wrong but we can have an interesting conversation about it all and have a more nuanced opinion.","Destiny, Genocide, and Nuance (effort post)",1672013889,"Destiny, Genocide, and Nuance (effort post) Hey Merry Christmas everyone, today were going to be talking about genocide.

707,Destiny,"Not an effort post, I have 10 mins before I start work.

From my understanding, Destiny's main defence of his recent tweets is that he refuses to contribute to the validation culture that exists in progressive spheres, and that it's important for him to have a voice calling out the mistakes made from victims to help people make better decisions in the future.

First point that confuses me is that in order to help people make better decisions in the future, wouldn't your messaging need to be palatable to the average person, who would really need to hear it? I feel like (could be wrong) the average female Destiny fan would more likely to be assertive of boundaries than the average person, and that the people who need Destinies advice the most are younger and more meek women. I dont see any normie, let alone progressive ever taking Destiny's critiques to heart due to how inflammatory his responses to real life situations are. 

(His long form content about these issues that don't relate to real life issues is usually excellent though, I'm thinking talks with Erudite or I think he had a great one with Tree a few years ago too, but they have less eyes on them from outside his community)

The second issue I see is that it seems like Destiny intentionally positions himself as the villain every time these situations arise. The greater narrative surrounding destiny is that he always phrases things in the most inflammatory light, even if he is correct on the technicalities, and then refuses any criticism by using those technicalities as a shield. This has been repeated a lot by Vaush and Hasan, but I've also seen other larger, less political figures parrot this. 

This gives the progressive spheres someone to rally behind and against, and I feel like almost everyone who needs to hear Destinys message would get swept into the opposite camp. I don't even believe this has to be a polarised 'Destiny vs Progressives' moment, but when Destiny attacks victims he creates that divide where you almost have to pick one side and fight the other. 

It seems like to me, if Destiny cared about helping women make better decisions through his messaging, his inflammatory attacks do not assist in those goals, but rather embolden people to attack him and push away the people who need to hear his message the most.

The post was reposted with a different title by John (deleted again) and the current Op Laenoric 

A thread was posted on LSF the day of the original stream in this clip butthat tread was downvoted to 0

First off the OP of the deleted threads is a known destiny hater and clip chimp: JohnLenin- 

The clip was chimped from 2 days prior

The post had a click bait title that got removed by the mods for being tmz tier garbo

The post was reposted with a different title by John (deleted again) and the current Op Laenoric 

A thread was posted on LSF the day of the original stream in this clip butthat tread was downvoted to 0

746,Destiny,"While watching the Hasan v. Fresh and Fit debate Destiny multiple times put forward an argument to the effect of ""If everyone could plead the 5th at any time it would destroy every court case."" This doesn't really follow or make sense in a court case. Most of the time, each side calls witnesses who want to testify for the side who called them. This means that the lawyer is using this witness to bolster their claims, and those claims are ones that the witness agrees with. If there is something in there that could incriminate them, then the lawyer would likely not ask about those things as they would talk before calling the witness. If a lawyer calls an adverse witness, someone who does not agree with their claims, they can ask to treat the witness as hostile and be allowed to ask leading questions. 

The 5th is usually invoked when the witness is being crossed by the other side. So they are being adversely crossed, and their credibility is being impinged. However, if you are a witness who is not a criminal defendant in the case, you cannot invoke the 5th on cross-examination if you have already testified on direct about this matter. Additionally, if a witness has immunity they can be compelled by the court to testify if they attempt to invoke the 5th.

In a criminal trial, if all of the witnesses of the prosecution just plead the 5th on the stand in both direct and cross-examination it would mean the prosecution would essentially have no case and be dismissed after the prosecution rested. It would also be incredibly bizarre. If all of the witnesses of the defense plead the 5th on the stand in both direct and cross-examination then the defense would have to simply hope the prosecution didn't carry their burden.

The argument also doesn't really incorporate how questioning in court would happen. In criminal court, the state has the burden of proof, so let's imagine they call witnesses and these witnesses all make testimony that support the claims of the state. Let's say one of the cops testifying planted evidence to secure the arrest. The defense suspects this but doesn't have proof that this happened. On cross-examination, the defense attorney asks, ""You planted evidence at the scene, correct?"" As the cop has not previously testified about whether or not he planted the evidence. The officer has a few options, he could admit it and tank the case, he could plead the 5th which we can all say doesn't affect the jury's deliberation but would at the very least discredit this cop, or he can just lie and say ""no."" If he does lie, at this point the defense attorney would need to provide some proof or a line of questioning that would expose the officer's lie. Pleading the 5th from a legal perspective has a specific role, in a pragmatic perspective in regards to how to conduct a trial it is very fluid and a dangerous tool to use depending on the witness and the trial you are in.

In a civil trial or a grand jury proceeding pleading the 5th can be used against you in the jury's deliberation. If all your witnesses plead the 5th, it would destroy your case and you would never call them.

That last one is what's tripping me up.

777,Destiny,"Just watched the new main channel video of D, Erudite, and Lycan talking about Ahrelevant's positions about relationships. I wanted to explore the body of his point a little more, since it felt like there was a pretty big blind spot in the conversation. 
As a disclaimer, all I've watched was about the first hour of the rele video, and the 40 minute conversation. Haven't seen anything outside of that, so it might exist, and I just haven't seen it yet.

It felt like the tone of the conversation was pretty aggressive, since it seemed understood that this was a pretty incel-y flavored set of takes, but I don't really think so, at least when you consider his discussion as a whole. It seemed like, from the beginning of the rele video, and it's first segments, that the conversation began with a discussion of dealing with toxic relationships, specifically when dealing with people with trauma caused by previous toxic relationships, that cause toxic behaviors like cheating and not respecting boundaries to arise in those current relationships. Rele seems to think it's shitty that a lot of times men that are good people (not 'nice guys'), that end up settling down with women like this later in their lives, have to deal with the toxic elements of these relationships, and that they generally shouldn't have to, since they didn't contribute to it.

This leads into a discussion of how these people develop trauma, and he seems to believe it comes about when they're manipulated and mistreated by their previous partners, usually men, who want something from them, usually sex. I agree with pretty much all of this, I don't think much of it is controversial. 
He continues to talk about the prevalence of these victims, because, for men that don't care about the effect of their actions on their partner, and are only looking for a hookup, manipulation is a pretty effective way to do it, and because of this, these men are mistreating a lot of women. This is shitty, beyond the obvious reasons, because it makes it significantly harder for them to get into healthy relationships later in life. When he talks about how there ought to be consequences to these behaviors, my understanding is that he's saying that good men ought to not put up with these toxic behaviors in committed relationships, and that by doing that, you discourage women from sleeping around with people that will mistreat them or forcing them to not perpetuate those behaviors. 

Now, I understand, for the most part, why a lot of this is in the blind spot. Rele doesn't do a very good job of carrying forward the former part of the discussion but spends a lot of time talking about how there's no (non-moral) reason to not manipulate women into sex. He just represents it poorly. Even the last part about the consequences is pretty poorly understood by me, I'm just filling in gaps with where I think he's going.

 That said though, it does really frustrate me when I see someone walk into a massive blunder that is addressed by the blind spot. D talks, like he usually does, about the importance of distinguishing hookups/FWB relationships, and genuine committed ones, and says that the more redpill-aligned takes only concern the former. This is, in the context of the discussion, false. Now that we have a blueprint for the entire conversation, we can understand that Rele actually does draw a pretty fine line between hookups, and committed relationships, saying that women that tend to engage in a lot of the former, tend to find it tougher to engage in the latter, because of the negative experiences they've carried forward, and their propensity for perpetuating cycles of abuse.

All in all, I was pretty disappointed in the conversation, since it seemed like a pretty pedestrian-level engagement with the real meat of his points. Again, for all I know there's more streams that go further in depth, I'm just speaking from what I've seen. Regardless though, I would like to see how people like D and Erudite meaningfully grapple with his assertions in full.",Exploring Ahrelevant's Relationship Points a Little More,1671946670,"Exploring Ahrelevant's Relationship Points a Little More Just watched the new main channel video of D, Erudite, and Lycan talking about Ahrelevant's positions about relationships.

781,Destiny,"I genuinely can't think of any other reason he continues to make these incredibly harsh statements that will obviously get him into hot water. 

Be honest with yourselves, if you were to ask any person that you respect in your personal life, ""is calling a SA victim a 'fucking idiot' the week they come out with their story an appropriate way to voice an opinion on how best to avoid sexual assault?"", what do you think their answer would be?

You can't make the defense that this is just something that was said in passing that he could've never known was going to get spread around. He called her a fucking idiot in the **final statement** of a thread that he sat down and collected screenshots for. He knew exactly what he was doing.

You can't say that people were going to be mad anyways. Basically every top comment on both LSF threads are specifically criticizing the aggressive insults, explicitly stating that there was a way to go about saying this without coming off like a total asshole. Plenty of people that aren't Vaush/Hasan schizoposters in there as well making similar criticisms too.

Calling it ""bad PR"" shows a lack of empathy. She's likely already felt like she was a fucking idiot, and asked herself similar questions, ""why did I ever go to his apartment?"" She likely considers it one of the worst mistakes of her life. If he were sitting on a stage next to her speaking to a crowd about how best to avoid sexual assault, I doubt he would have phrased it the same way.

So the only defense that leaves is that he just enjoys the heat. Totally fine, but that's not the level of social commentary that I care for. It's funny to call the schizoid conservative YouTube chatters dipshits, it's funny to go off on other creators being bad faith when they attack you first, but going after this girl with personal insults in a thread trying to make a broader statement about protecting yourself from SA just feels wrong, especially when the entire twitter thread works BETTER without the insults, not to mention it probably would have convinced a lot more people who didn't have an opinion.

But what if in the original claim, or even in a response to criticism, the girl just said:

**""I realize I made poor choices that led me to being in that situation. That doesn't mean I deserved what happened. Leave me alone.""**

There's no way Destiny would have take the tone he did calling her stupid. The problem is that when the woman's choices are this poor, and everything is public, *it does have to be said* that the choices were very stupid.

But what if in the original claim, or even in a response to criticism, the girl just said:

**""I realize I made poor choices that led me to being in that situation. That doesn't mean I deserved what happened. Leave me alone.""**

There's no way Destiny would have take the tone he did calling her stupid. The problem is that when the woman's choices are this poor, and everything is public, *it does have to be said* that the choices were very stupid.

815,Destiny,"The desire for sex and affection that men have for women is the equivalent to a ravenous hunger. Since women don't experience these urges at all, there is a natural power differential between men and women due to supply and demand. There is a demand for female affection and sex, but none for men's.  This enables all women to possess some kind of innate power that they may use to manipulate men and validate their own worth with affection being their tool. Women are like queens and nobles looking down on men from the pinnacle of the heirarchy, while men are like starving peasants scraping up crumbs to get by. Even women who are objectively, physically NOT impressive, who lack symmetry, extremelty short or over/under weight, still holds far more power than the average man. Its INSANITY.

Male sexuality is the reason why men are so insecure and are treated like peasants, while women are always put on a pedestal and are treated like gods.

If men suddenly had the sex drive of women, women would have NO power over men. There would be no more simping, no more gold digging, no more hypergamy, no more men feeling ugly, nothing. Things would finally be mututal.

817,Destiny,"I think Destiny's take [about saying you are confident but not around women](https://youtu.be/yIRg5g5_VrA?t=400) meaning that you aren't confident at all, is fucking brain dead.

To be confident around women you need more than just confidence in yourself:  
\- You need confidence that the rejection won't matter, but depending on the social situation it might always have big consequences.  
\- You need to be confident that the other person percieves you as valuable, but this can be entirely disconnected from the reasons why you value yourself. As an example, if you are proud of being a massive piece of shit to others, but she only likes agreeable femboys, you can go eat shit.  
\- You need to have confidence that the other person understands you and doesn't react in am immature, hasty or malicious way.

In other words: You need confidence in your surroundings and her, not just confidence in yourself.

Bonus: I once asked a girl out on Discord and she laughed about it.

826,Destiny,"Specifically [this](https://youtu.be/SNle0a-ABq0?t=1588) part of the video. This is a common talking point of Steven's and despite the fact that I agree with most things that he says and really respect his content and his approach to how he comes up with the conclusion of his ideas, I think he has some ignorance when it comes to the struggles some men when it comes to dating. Steve is obviously a very skilled conversationalist, who before using his talents to become a professional streamer, excelled at a customer service position and progressed faster than most in his casino job I believe. Steven comparing himself to other people in this arena is probably akin to an athlete telling other people to ""lol just run faster"". 

The only thing I can use to rebut this is the talk about my personal situation and the situations of a few male friends that I have or have had over the past few year. Yes is probably going to be unconvincing for a lot of you that I'm not bringing in hard evidence to support my point, but so isn't Destiny bringing hard evidence.

So I'm 30 years old guy, around 280 pounds and 6 foot 3. In terms of looks I'm probably the epitome of average, or around it if I had to guess. I admit, I am overweight, but I carry it somewhat well due to my height and a lot of women I am showing romantic interest in are also fat and sometimes fatter. I have my own place, a full time job as a qualified Librarian, I keep my place clean and I'm okay with keeping my affairs in order. I have an okay amount of luck when it comes to using Tinder, usually averaging around 10 to 20 matches a week, helped by the fact that I live in a largish UK city which is somewhat small in size but pretty densely populated. I can usually, if I'm trying, secure a date once a month off of Tinder due to the fact that I have pretty good photos of myself, I have a really good about me section and my texting skills are really good and witty (I've had really positive compliments from friends about both things and once had a text from a female acquaintance complimenting my profile after she stumbled upon my Tinder profile). The issues I have when it comes to dating for me, at least this must be the issue, is on the first date. From my point of view, first dates generally go well. The conversation seems to flow, I'm good at asking them questions without making it seem like an interrogation. we talk about our interests, I'm usually able to make them laugh and the date, more times than not, end with a kiss on the lips. On 2 occasions, I've hooked up with women I've met up with on Tinder and on 1 of those occasions, it ended up being a fwb arrangement which is still going to this day.

""So what's the issue?"" you're probably thinking. ""You're not the type of person that Destiny is talking about"". That's the problem, I am. Every single woman that I have ever shown romantic interest in shows none back. I don't have a mattress in the middle of my room with no other furniture at all in my flat. I wash my asshole and don't think it's gay to wash my asshole. I regularly use anti-dandruff shampoo (to prevent dandruff) and conditioner, and have haircuts when I need to. I am and have all of the things, in Destiny's world, that you need in order to have luck when dating. The so called bare-minimum. Yet, I get nothing after the first date except them saying that they didn't feel any chemistry or that ""spark"". It's a similar thing with some of my male friends too. They are absolutely fine, normal dudes who are fine to get along with. They are fine at managing their lives (I didn't ask them about the situation with their asshole I'll admit that), they are average looking, yet are also perpetually single. 

I don't have a concrete answer as to why some average men struggle at dating I guess. A lot of it is probably because women are generally happier single. Some of it might be because some women have had shitty or traumatic experiences dating men previously so aren't as interested in dating again. A hunch I have is that maybe it's because some men don't know how to send the right type of signals through body language and their tone of voice when showing romantic interest, like they are unknowingly sending friendly signals instead of romantic signals, but maybe that's just cope on my end. Whatever the reason is, I believe that there are plenty of men out there who, on paper, would make good romantic partners, but for whatever reason, don't make women feel that warm, fuzzy feeling. 

The last point I want to make, and this idea has been living rent free in my head for a while, is that you can't live in two worlds where romantic chemistry between two people is this ineffable thing where such a connection cannot be easily explained, and on the other hand chastise men by using what is essentially fencel ideology by saying that the only reason men can't find a girlfriend is because they are fucking useless. Can you define a why people are attracted to each other or can't you; pick one.

831,Destiny,"First off, welcome back to Nebraska Steve; I love when he makes a guest appearance on stream. 

Second, literally everything he is saying is true and it is so beyond mind-boggling how many people are trying to argue against it? I can only assume these people have to be either teenagers or just getting into college and don't have the real world experience yet to understand what Destiny is saying.

The one piece of advice he consistently is putting out there is to not go to, or invite someone over to, your house/apartment if you don't want to have sex. Wanna eat? Go someplace public. Wanna have coffee? Find a starbucks. Wanna watch something? Theaters exist. You can do all of those ""date"" and ""get to know one another"" things in public. And hey, if things are going well, then you can consider an invite to someplace more private. If things are going badly, you can just leave and you also have the safety of being in public.

How is this not obvious? People are fucking wild and I feel like it should be obvious that maybe inviting complete strangers into your home has more potential to go poorly than feeling someone out on a coffee date at a public cafe first. 

Like, a majority of the time a person getting raped is getting raped by someone they know. Here are some ""fun"" stats:

https://www.creditdonkey.com/date-rape-statistics.html

&gt;How often is a stranger the perpetrator of the rape?

&gt;In only 13.8% of the cases is a stranger involved in the rape. 51% of the time an intimate partner is the cause and 40.8% of the time it's an acquaintance. For the remaining 12%, the perpetrator is a family member. 

Most of the time, it's not a stranger jumping out from the bushes and assaulting someone. A majority of the time, rapes occur between people that know one another and usually are intimate partners. 

And, to the point:

&gt;How many sexual assaults occur in the victim's home or the home of someone they know?

&gt;A shocking 55% of the date rapes occurred in the victim's own home. As many as 12% of the rapes occurred in a relative's or acquaintance's home. 

So maybe keep your dates in public if you don't want to have sex. If you're not ready for sex, that's fine. If you just don't want to have sex, that's fine. So protect yourself and keep things out in public where it's significantly less likely someone is going to try to assault you. 

And also:

&gt;What is the most common date rape drug used?

&gt;Alcohol is the number one date rape drug used. Even though it's technically not a drug, any substance that impairs a person's judgement is considered a drug. 

Maybe having that ""date"" at a bar is not the best choice. But if you want to go imbibe some adult beverages: be safe, drink water, don't do 5 shots in a row, and have a plan to get home (uber, lyft, a drunk bus if you have those programs in town). Probably DON'T rely on your date to be your DD. Shitty as it is, this is how rapes happen. Don't go home with them and don't let them take you home either.

In conclusion, the world is scary, people can and will take advantage of you, and it sucks. But there are many ways you can protect yourself and be safe to at least reduce those chances.

Songs about the night in question

First up we got Tory Lanez on his first project released after the shooting ""Daystar"". This project is all about his time with Megan, the shooting, and the aftermath but one song goes into a little more detail. 

Tory Lanez - Queen and Slim 3rd verse (8/24/2020)
https://youtu.be/_6pepDj7PnE

Next time, the pool with you and Kylie
Hoped in it, coolin', nigga wilin'
She was lookin' like a fuckin' angel
Lookin' like a baby in a manger
Hop step, went to the car
(Motherfucker, but, bitch, you got me fucked up)
Me and Kylie still off in the pool
We just chillin', kickin' shit, was cool
Both of us ain't know you was trippin'
Even though I got a crush on Kylie
I woulda left with you if I knew you was dippin' for the simple reason
You invited me but I can't act like shawty didn't excite me
I had took a wrong turn that night
Well not a turn that everybody think
I wasn't the wrong one that night
You was just too drunk to even see it
Wasn't anticipatin', I'd never put you in no situation
I've never even had an argument with ya
A conversation is all I'm bargainin' with ya
'Cause you was my nigga for real
And if you can agree, then you owe me that
Our mothers would tell us to do the right thing
And it's friendship, my nigga, you told me that
So even when niggas is comin' at me on they Twitter and Insta, I'm over that
'Cause what's a couple months of memes of me
If it means, I'm gon' get my homie back?

This whole project is worth a listen in my opinion 

Next up

Megan Thee Stallion - Shots Fired (11/19/2020)
With one of the most disrespectful lines I've ever heard near the end 🤣
https://youtu.be/P8jNPawT-aM

Imagine niggas lyin' 'bout shootin' a real bitch
Just to save face for rapper niggas you chill with
Imagine me givin' a fuck it was your fuckin' birthday (fuck you)
You in your feelings, I just thought it was another Thursday
Now imagine me cockblockin' niggas on some dry shit 
I don't want you on the bitch
believe you wouldn't've been invited 
And if it weren't for me
same week, you would have been indicted
You offered M's not to talk, I guess that made my friend excited, hmm
Now y'all in cahoots, huh (okay), you a puss in boots
You shot a 5'10"" bitch with a .22
Talkin' 'bout bones and tendons like them bullets wasn't pellets
A pussy nigga with a pussy gun in his feelings 🤣
Okay, he in the backseat and he keep callin' me a bitch
We all know the shit I could've came back with (lil' ass nigga)
He talkin' 'bout his followers, dollars, and goofy shit
I told him, ""You're not poppin', you just on the remix"" (what's poppin'?)

Megan also goes in on Kelsey in the 2nd verse speaking about her getting her chain snatched and taking a loss (Kelsey's chain and her broken nail were found in the middle of the street that night) 


To wrap things up we got Kelsey Harris, Megan's ex best friend and assistant who was in the car that night. They were friends for 10+ years before that night. Megan accuses Kelsey of taking a bribe from Tory. Also, she's not a rapper I don't think lol.

Who i'm taking shots at? bitch, i'm busting you
I'm talking to that same bitch that crashed that boat on 42

Couldn't control your little feelings, look what dick is costing you

Shout out bobby shmurda but this bitch is really tweaking, bro 
If i was the one with the gun you would've heard about a murder (r.i.p.) 
Said her back was turned but that girl know who really hurt her
 Never been a jealous friend and the people really know it
 If you would've kept it silent then i would've been told it (bitch) 
 See i really thought i knew you, thought that you would keep it 
 If you wanna talk gangsta, bitch i'm really from the street 
 Imagine lying to the d.a. saying i took some hush money (huh?)
Put a muzzle on your friends, y'all acting like some crash dummies (skrrt) 
Got my chain snatched? damn, here you go lying To be an a-list celeb, you doing too much trying
Where i get this money from? bitch, you knew i was a hustler 
Way she did should've knew i couldn't trust her Protect black women, huh? but you sending threats to me 
Damn, i thought that you was solid, now the (joke's on me) 
Damn, i ain't wanna have to do this but you steady shooting shots (brrt, brrt) 
Dez said if i spoke that a sex tape could drop 
Was never supposed to be against each other, this what y'all made it (ah)
I'ma still live it up, yeah, i know y'all realy hate it (ha) Sucking dick behind my back, who really on they knees? 
You an overachiever, all you do is suck seed Claiming you a pimp, huh? but you slippin' on your mackin' (damn) 
Are you lying to your label? do they really know what happened?
(who shot ya?) 'cause you know it wasn't me was 10 toes down whenever you had beef It's a god damn shame 
All you had to do was clear your best friend's name (yup) 
All you had to do was keep it real and stay the same (ah)
But you switched up on me for the money and the fame Who shot you?

852,Destiny,"A  response to the most recent thread from destiny friend snarkily posts a  screenshot of the definition of victim blaming. Of course, this is a  cropped Wikipedia definition and the full definition from the sexual  assault center of Edmonton is much more narrow and outlines the specific  characteristics of victim blaming in context.

[https://www.sace.ca/learn/victim-blaming/](https://www.sace.ca/learn/victim-blaming/)

\&gt;  It’s questioning people who experience violence — especially sexual   violence — about their actions, and what they could have done to prevent   it, or worse, invite it. It’s pointing out supposed weaknesses or   differences in a person that could have made them a target. In general,   it’s the common tendency for people to look for the cause of violence  as  something the person who experienced harm did or didn’t do to  prevent  it.

It's important to  note the victim blaming is not an all or nothing game. You can point to  flaws in communication that may have amplified and increased the  potential for sexual assault. Of course, complete victim blaming makes  no sense, because tautologically, a perpetrator creates the victim and  is thus primarily responsible for the harm caused to the victim. But we  all know this, this isn't new or exciting information, it's boring.

Different  sites will define victim blaming in different ways; however, whether  you crop the first senescent of a Wikipedia article, or you provide a  coherent definition from a reputable source there seems to be a general  idea of what victim blaming is. Victim blaming is that act of finding  fault in a victims behavior. This behavior facilitates the abuse from  the perpetrator. Understanding the actual meaning of victim blaming  leads us to conclude that victim blaming isn't a 70 year old man who  tells an abuse victim to not wear lipstick in public. There are cases  where victim blaming can be productive.

In  any case, destiny is victim blaming by suggesting that Azalia could've  taken the bare minimum steps to remove herself from a situation where  sexual assault could've taken place. The thread goes over this in depth  and even points to situations where Azalia knew and signaled that she  was not interested in fucking Rich. The language, tone and content of  the thread is clearly demonstrates that destiny is engaging in victim  blaming according to all relevant definitions.

The  most common argument against victim blaming is that it silences people  who would otherwise speak out about potential abuse. The argument is  sound, but it removes agency from victims to be receptive about their  possible faults and it neglects potential resources that people can use  to prevent abuse. If someone is silenced by feedback and advice, that's a  serious issue, but the source of the issue is not the blaming itself,  it's about how that blame is casted. If someone is calling you retarded  for not taking the necessary steps when you understand the potential  danger Is it possible to create  a safe avenue for people to talk openly  about the potential risks and remedies to dangerous situations.

Victim  blaming could be understood in two scales. First, is victim blaming  legitimate? and second. Is the victim blaming effective? In destiny's  case, the victim blaming was completely legitimate, whether or not it  was effective was more of a toss up for several reasons. He has a reason  to be more aggressive given Azealia's age and prior behavior toward  Rich, but the if the criticism is going to be effective, it should be  generalized to a broader group of women that might be sexually assaulted  in the future. If this is the case, the rhetoric should go from an 9 to  a 6, but maybe that's too soy idk","Yes, destiny is victim blaming. Does that matter?",1671901149,"Yes, destiny is victim blaming.

&gt;the banality of evil basically means that people are capableof doing things that are by end effect like very evil but it doesn't require an evil person to do it  
&gt;  
&gt;so most Nazis probably weren't Super Evil people but they did an evil thing  
&gt;  
&gt;there's a difference between people that are intentionally Evil versus like they happen to be evil or they happen to be in part of the evil system

and then they talk about the ""small folk"" in the nazi society like the shoe maker and how they participate and help the evil system while not actually being evil.

6:32 from destiny

&gt;I think what you're saying is we can acknowledge that a genocide is happening against a current group of people but for multiple reasons that people shouldn't take violent like defense one reason might be the people committing the genocide I'm going to  
&gt;  
&gt;invoke the banality of evil and say the people committing the genocide aren't intentionally doing it it's happening out of ignorance therefore they're not like earning the punishment of death for committing a genocide that's part one and part two is okay fine maybe they're

&gt;and that's why I brought up the banality of evil in the beginning the vast majority of people who made that possible in the first place were not actively you know killing Jewish people they were either letting it happen or supporting those policies or you know they but they weren't actively torturing Jewish people sure but it doesn't matter you're still complicit in the system

&amp;#x200B;

but the term actually means the opposite, the term was created to describe Eichmann. one of the chief architects of the holocaust. and the meaning came entirely from Arendt's impression of him from his trial, it's not about the average citizens or workers in that society. which if Steven wants to read more about it he can just read a bit on things like  the ""asch conformity experiment"" and the famous Milgram experiments.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Arendt found Eichmann an ordinary, rather bland, bureaucrat, who in her words, was ‘neither perverted nor sadistic’, but ‘terrifyingly normal’. He acted without any motive other than to diligently advance his career in the Nazi bureaucracy. Eichmann was not an amoral monster, Instead, he performed evil deeds without evil intentions, a fact connected to his ‘thoughtlessness’, a disengagement from the reality of his evil acts. Eichmann ‘never realised what he was doing’ due to an ‘inability… to think from the standpoint of somebody else’. Lacking this particular cognitive ability, he ‘commit\[ted\] crimes under circumstances that made it well-nigh impossible for him to know or to feel that he \[was\] doing wrong’.

the people doing the deed must be aware and know what they are doing but need to not do it from an ""evil intention"" like hate, sadistic pleasure or anger. ""I was just following orders"", a bureaucrat who just wants to advance in the ranks.

so if we take it to the conversation of ""conservatives start genocyding trans ppl"" the term  can be applied to the man organizing it and killing trans people not the shoe maker or your random citizen. and it will be applied only on the conditions the person participating is not doing doing it out of actual malice but just to do he job, for monetary value etc

In the first case there is a deer approaching the target, but he is not near the target enough to be hurt. So the shooter intends to shoot his target and scare the deer. But instead the person in the ghillie suit, the spook, times the shooter’s shot and scares the deer to run into the bullet. This kills the deer. Who is responsible for killing the deer?

Now imagine we were back before the case with the deer. In fact there was no deer. just the two guys in the ghillie suit and the shooter.

886,Destiny,"Been thinking a lot about AI art and hearing people's arguments about it. Decided to give the best representation of the arguments I've heard against it that I could find. For clarity's sake, I do like AI generated art.  

**The main strongest argument5 against AI generated images**

 • Deepfake / ai generated cp / people claiming credit for other's sketches using img2img 

\- This seems essentially the argument of whether it's responsible to give bad actors the tools to behave maliciously. 

\- On the one hand it'd be negligent to give everyone easy access to bombs but on the other hand it'd be silly to take away everyone's cooking knives. I suppose the boundary then would be thought of in terms of the cost to benefit ratio of allowing people access to these tools, which I'm imagining is a more subjective and personally driven answer than a clear cut answer. 

\- Plus I don't even think we're fully decided on the morality of deep fakes. Personally, as long as it's not passed off as real and not used to harass or otherwise bully someone, then it seems to me no harm no foul.

**Arguments against using/supporting specific AI models**

 These aren't really arguments against the technology itself, but rather against the ways certain models (like stable diffusion) are trained

 1. People's art is being used for training without their permission 

\- This argument rests on what rights, morally, artists have to the usage of their work after releasing it to the public.  

\- The reason we have copyright laws (morally speaking) is because sometimes creating something is difficult but copying it is easy. Thus, in order to incentivize people to create things, we provide exclusive rights to the reproduction and profit off of it to the person/people who came up with it.  

\- As it relates to AI, one could make the argument that people are using other's art to make profit (by selling models or otherwise getting profit from training models off of their art), and furthermore using human's art to indirectly reduce the value of human art by creating substitutes 

\- On the other hand, one could also say that if the model is only trained on publicly available data (deviant art, art station, etc. ) that they don't really have much of a right to stop their work being used, especially when the data that comes out of the training process can't specifically be linked to any particular piece of art.

2. Overfitting can cause it to practically copy the images it was trained on

\- This is definitely possible in a few cases. [Hank green had an interesting example where midjourney accidentally recreated a popular national geographic image](https://youtu.be/kqPKNksl9hk).

\- Hearing this argument makes me think of accidental plagiarism. In the same way that humans can sometimes copy concepts they've heard without realizing (e.g. comedians accidentally stealing jokes, or musical artists writing songs that can sound eerily similar to other song), the AI can seemingly do the same. I'm not sure how exactly that's practically dealt, however in theory I'd image these would be disputes far and few enough between (and even fewer between as the models get better) that they can be settled on a case by case basis. 

\- This also brings up another point about how different does something have to be for it to be considered copied. This question gets even blurrier now that ML models can practically create a set of images gradually getting more and more similar to an original, meaning we either have to draw the line somewhere on this spectrum, or reject the framing of the question entirely and just say you can't use AI generated work if it's recognizably similar to someone's copyrighted work.

**Arguments that I don't think are very strong (from both sides)**

• ""It's just copy pasting images"" / ""it's looking up images on the internet"" 

\- This is just wrong. There are already dozens of people who have explained it better than me, but the long and short of it is that it learns what different concepts look like from the training data. Not only that, but the training process converts upwards of 40tb of training data into a 4gb model. Unless you think it's possible to compress 40tb into 4gb, it's not directly copy pasting, it's at best overfitting some images. 

• ""AI learns exactly like people do"" 

\- Only really half true. It's probably true that its learning method more closely resembles how humans learn than, say, a chess algorithm that finds the best moves by playing out all possible moves. However saying that they both learn *exactly* the same, kind of assumes you know exactly how the brain works, which is a stretch. 

• ""It's not real art"" / ""it doesn't have heart or soul"" / ""it doesn't take a lot of effort like you would if you actually learned how to draw""

\- These aren't really arguments for why it's bad to use it, it's just a statement about personal preference.

 • ""The models are predisposed to the biases in the training data"" 

\- True, but not a reason that using AI technology is morally bad. Not even really a reason that the models are bad (morally speaking). Sure it sucks sometimes when the AI generates something you didn't want it to because of its biases, but it doesn't pertain to whether people should be allowed use it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; The strongest arguments I could find against current AI image generation are 1. bad actors using it maliciously, 2. training models on people's art without their permission, and 3. the AI accidentally recreating copyrighted or otherwise protected images.

&amp;#x200B;

\- This also brings up another point about how different does something have to be for it to be considered copied. This question gets even blurrier now that ML models can practically create a set of images gradually getting more and more similar to an original, meaning we either have to draw the line somewhere on this spectrum, or reject the framing of the question entirely and just say you can't use AI generated work if it's recognizably similar to someone's copyrighted work.

**Arguments that I don't think are very strong (from both sides)**

• ""It's just copy pasting images"" / ""it's looking up images on the internet"" 

\- This is just wrong. There are already dozens of people who have explained it better than me, but the long and short of it is that it learns what different concepts look like from the training data. Not only that, but the training process converts upwards of 40tb of training data into a 4gb model. Unless you think it's possible to compress 40tb into 4gb, it's not directly copy pasting, it's at best overfitting some images. 

• ""AI learns exactly like people do"" 

\- Only really half true. It's probably true that its learning method more closely resembles how humans learn than, say, a chess algorithm that finds the best moves by playing out all possible moves. However saying that they both learn *exactly* the same, kind of assumes you know exactly how the brain works, which is a stretch. 

• ""It's not real art"" / ""it doesn't have heart or soul"" / ""it doesn't take a lot of effort like you would if you actually learned how to draw""

\- These aren't really arguments for why it's bad to use it, it's just a statement about personal preference.

 • ""The models are predisposed to the biases in the training data"" 

\- True, but not a reason that using AI technology is morally bad. Not even really a reason that the models are bad (morally speaking). Sure it sucks sometimes when the AI generates something you didn't want it to because of its biases, but it doesn't pertain to whether people should be allowed use it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; The strongest arguments I could find against current AI image generation are 1. bad actors using it maliciously, 2. training models on people's art without their permission, and 3. the AI accidentally recreating copyrighted or otherwise protected images.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm not an expert in any of this, so if I missed anything or if you have any feedback I'd love to hear it."

892,Destiny,"So I listened to the stream tonight and heard them say a few things that I just wanted to clear up. 

1. Aba mentions LTG having a “good track record on YouTube” when talking about how long he’s been on the platform and you would think someone with that kind of track record would have some recourse after getting banned. Well, he DOESN’T have a good track record on YouTube. He doesn’t have a good track record ANYWHERE for that matter. He’s gotten a LOT of strikes over the years for content violations, at one point he had two at once and was so scared of getting a third he deleted something like a third of his videos because he was so worried someone would find something in them that would get him a 3rd strike and a ban. He’s always been pushing the line of acceptable content, getting reported frequently for his racist, homophobic comments and other flagrant things like doxing and harassing people, watching explicit videos on stream (both sexually and violent), and a litany of other things. The notion that he has any kind of “good track record” is pretty laughable. He also isn’t that big in terms of being a content creator, it took him 10 years to get to 100K subs and was pretty widely known for using viewbots and buying subs. When he did get banned, few were surprised that it happened, the only surprise was that it took this long and that it wasn’t his content or behavior that did it, it was just a ban evasion. 

2. Destiny mentions how YouTube has been his “career” for 10 years and asks how can he just go back to regular work now after doing this for so long. Well, without getting personal, he’s been doing regular work the entire time he’s been on YouTube, and it’s because his channel doesn’t make that much. You can see for yourself if you look at social blade, he definitely makes money from his channel but it’s not a fortune. Probably not enough to live off, and like I mentioned he’s been working regular jobs the entirety of his “YouTube career”, so he wouldn’t be going back to a regular job, regular jobs are all he really knows. 

3. This is like the coup de grace. At the end Destiny compared him to the character in American History X, how he put in so much work to change his life and redeem himself, and he still got screwed in the end….. uhhhhh, FUCKING WHAT??????? EXCUSE ME??????? Steven, dude - you do NOT know what you’re talking about here. He didn’t do jack fucking shit towards “redeeming himself”… he’s still the same person he always was, making mean, offensive, crude, racist, homophobic, and misogynistic comments and doing tons of toxic shit on a nightly basis. The ONLY thing he has done that I can see is he’s stopped playing street fighter as much as he used to - the game that is responsible for most of his rages - and he’s put in a lot of work to not get trolled, so overall he rages less, and usually the worst of what he says and does is a result of him raging, but they still happen, and he still says and does all kinds of terrible stuff even when he isn’t raging. About a month or so ago he was harassing another content creator, doxing him on his stream and telling his fans how he would be calling the guys HR dept every day in an attempt to get the guy fired (his company and their contact info were also doxed for all viewers to see) Why? He made a video about LTG that he didn’t like. The guy that talks so much shit about others can’t handle when people talk shit back to him. He can dish it out but he can’t take it. 

I’m honestly just beside myself every time I hear destiny talking about LTG, because it’s abundantly clear he doesn’t know him at all, and I’m pretty sure the little he does know came from LTG’s mouth, and the problem there is he’s a compulsive liar. He lied about having the strike on his channel to his own fans (he told them he was “just building up his other channel”) he lies about his age every time the topic comes up, and tons of other meaningless stuff that isn’t even important and doesn’t matter, which is the sign of a compulsive liar.

I know that as a principle you guys are against deplatforming and all that, but I’m telling you, you do not have the right impression of this guy.  He’s not deserving of the support or praise you’re heaping on him. The only thing he did deserve was his ban. Just look at every other platform he’s been on - been banned on twitch like 10 times, Twitter 10 times. Facebook a handful of times.

939,Destiny,"This post starts with the question: why do streamers take part in sexual assault drama?

Bear with me because I promise it has a more interesting explanation than “viewership.” Making the question relevant is that over the past few years, we have seen a few prominent sexual assault cases—Fed and Yvonne, Slick and Adrianah, and, most recently, Rich Campbell and Azalia Lexi. Around all these cases, a phenomenon arose where, beyond even the assaulters/assaultees telling their stories on stream, a cottage industry of other streamers giving takes on the sexual assault became expected. Moreso, fighting amongst streamers, unrelated to the SA, epitomized SA Drama. So, again, I ask why?

The answer is not the obvious one of viewership. Large streamers, the kind of streamers who ostensibly would get more eyes on them for a drama stream, don’t have significant, long-term viewership increases from SA drama. Don’t believe me, check the stats. Hassan, XQC, Trainwrecks, and Adrianah all have the same or decreased viewership before and after the SA circus they were involved in. D-Man has increased viewership, but I argue that’s because of other streaming moves he’s made and not his drama streams; at the very least, the drama streams aren’t the primary mover for his growth.

The other obvious answer, enjoyment, probably isn’t the explanans either. Besides Destiny, the streamers involved in SA drama find it stressful, frequently saying they hate it.

Complicating the question further is the fact that streamers have much to lose engaging in the drama. One wrong statement and it looks like you are now victim-blaming or somehow at fault. The best example of this was when Hassan had to fight in the trenches to make it clear that he didn’t commit a SA at a party he literally wasn’t at. What if Hassan couldn’t make it clear and advertisers found out? Another example is how fraught revealing Adrianah’s story became for Train and XQC. Again, this could look bad for advertisers. SA drama is not good for streamers’ bottom line. The drama also doesn’t auger rising interpersonal relationships for streamers: it burns not builds bridges. Streamers know this too. Think about how common statements like, “I will be canceled” or “I hope I don’t get clipped for this” are in SA drama.

So, streamers knowingly engage in SA drama which isn’t good for viewership, advertisers, friendships, or personal enjoyment. Put another way, they take part in an activity where the potential utility is outweighed by the disutility it portends. The situation I just described was first described by Jeremy Bethman, who described it as “deep play,” which is an activity that parties engage in where they have more to lose than to gain. In other words, it is a type of irrational activity, where both parties are “in over their heads.”

Anthropologist Clifford Geertz used this deep play concept to explicate why cockfighting was so culturally important for Balinese people. For the Balinese, it wasn’t the money that was bet on the fights or the costs of raising and caring for a rooster that made the fights “deep” (though this, in some sense, made the cockfighting irrational). Rather it was the fact that the fights came to represent social status that gave them their depth—the winner of a fight would get a couple of “atta boy”s and move on within the community; the loser would be expected to destroy himself socially—by ransacking his home—and metaphysically—by destroying shrines and cursing the gods. So, cockfighting is “deep” within Balinese culture because it is irrational, socially, to cockfight when the expected social value of a fight is negative.

How do we get back to twitch streamers and SA drama? I argue that twitch streamers engage in SA drama as a form of “deep play.” It is irrational for them to do so on a financial and personal basis. Nonetheless, they do so because partaking in SA drama represents a fight about where they stand in the social status hierarchy. It is just another type of cockfighting not involving roosters: a dick-measuring contest streamers feel the need to participate in to show where they stand in the twitch landscape.

To answer the question at the top of the page, streamers thirst for SA drama, despite it being irrational for them to do so because it is a form of “deep play.” It lets them measure their e-peen, an irresistible act for streamers. In other words, streamers do SA drama for clout. I think the depth of play around SA drama is also why Destiny enjoys it so much. It is high stakes and stressful, anything to stimulate our Factorio goblin (along, of course, with the potential to help out the victim or person who was wrongly accused).

Sorry this conclusion isn’t much more interesting than “viewership,” but it was fun writing this post and I hope you found it interesting. I’m curious about what other, better explanations you guys have.

TLDR: STREAMERS CAN’T GET ENOUGH SEXUAL ASSAULT CONTENT BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOUTSHARKS EVEN THOUGH THE SA CLOUT IS TRASH.",Effortpost: Why so many streamers participate in sexual assault drama,1671831279,"Effortpost: Why so many streamers participate in sexual assault drama This post starts with the question: why do streamers take part in sexual assault drama?

Bear with me because I promise it has a more interesting explanation than “viewership.” Making the question relevant is that over the past few years, we have seen a few prominent sexual assault cases—Fed and Yvonne, Slick and Adrianah, and, most recently, Rich Campbell and Azalia Lexi. Around all these cases, a phenomenon arose where, beyond even the assaulters/assaultees telling their stories on stream, a cottage industry of other streamers giving takes on the sexual assault became expected. Moreso, fighting amongst streamers, unrelated to the SA, epitomized SA Drama. So, again, I ask why?

The answer is not the obvious one of viewership. Large streamers, the kind of streamers who ostensibly would get more eyes on them for a drama stream, don’t have significant, long-term viewership increases from SA drama. Don’t believe me, check the stats. Hassan, XQC, Trainwrecks, and Adrianah all have the same or decreased viewership before and after the SA circus they were involved in. D-Man has increased viewership, but I argue that’s because of other streaming moves he’s made and not his drama streams; at the very least, the drama streams aren’t the primary mover for his growth.

The other obvious answer, enjoyment, probably isn’t the explanans either. Besides Destiny, the streamers involved in SA drama find it stressful, frequently saying they hate it.

Complicating the question further is the fact that streamers have much to lose engaging in the drama. One wrong statement and it looks like you are now victim-blaming or somehow at fault. The best example of this was when Hassan had to fight in the trenches to make it clear that he didn’t commit a SA at a party he literally wasn’t at. What if Hassan couldn’t make it clear and advertisers found out? Another example is how fraught revealing Adrianah’s story became for Train and XQC. Again, this could look bad for advertisers. SA drama is not good for streamers’ bottom line. The drama also doesn’t auger rising interpersonal relationships for streamers: it burns not builds bridges. Streamers know this too. Think about how common statements like, “I will be canceled” or “I hope I don’t get clipped for this” are in SA drama.

So, streamers knowingly engage in SA drama which isn’t good for viewership, advertisers, friendships, or personal enjoyment. Put another way, they take part in an activity where the potential utility is outweighed by the disutility it portends. The situation I just described was first described by Jeremy Bethman, who described it as “deep play,” which is an activity that parties engage in where they have more to lose than to gain. In other words, it is a type of irrational activity, where both parties are “in over their heads.”

Anthropologist Clifford Geertz used this deep play concept to explicate why cockfighting was so culturally important for Balinese people. For the Balinese, it wasn’t the money that was bet on the fights or the costs of raising and caring for a rooster that made the fights “deep” (though this, in some sense, made the cockfighting irrational). Rather it was the fact that the fights came to represent social status that gave them their depth—the winner of a fight would get a couple of “atta boy”s and move on within the community; the loser would be expected to destroy himself socially—by ransacking his home—and metaphysically—by destroying shrines and cursing the gods. So, cockfighting is “deep” within Balinese culture because it is irrational, socially, to cockfight when the expected social value of a fight is negative.

How do we get back to twitch streamers and SA drama? I argue that twitch streamers engage in SA drama as a form of “deep play.” It is irrational for them to do so on a financial and personal basis. Nonetheless, they do so because partaking in SA drama represents a fight about where they stand in the social status hierarchy. It is just another type of cockfighting not involving roosters: a dick-measuring contest streamers feel the need to participate in to show where they stand in the twitch landscape.

To answer the question at the top of the page, streamers thirst for SA drama, despite it being irrational for them to do so because it is a form of “deep play.” It lets them measure their e-peen, an irresistible act for streamers.

A lot of sport athletes suck when it come to messaging or their own wild thoughts like the Kyrie Irving's, Jaylen Brown's, Aaron Rodgers'. Even guys like Michael ""republicans buy shoes too"" Jordan had his own problems in terms of being afraid to make comments. Lebron James has been arguably bad with some of his comments while good in others, but  the inconsistency is key. 

There is this fella **Kareem Abdul Jabbar** who is up there with Michael Jordan in terms of greatness for the sport of basketball who has lowkey been a good take machine for a lot of his life. 

Even if you don't really follow basketball, you probably know what a ""*slam dunk*"" is. They outlawed *Slam Dunks* in college when Kareem played, because he was so fucking dominant. The ""*most valuable player*"" award given to the ""best"" player during a season at the end of the year is named after Jordan now, but Kareem Abdul Jabbar won MORE in his career. Most points ever scored in an NBA career? That's right, your boy KAJ has that record. KAJ had the record for the most *blocks* ever, a defensive stat where you prevent a player on the other team from scoring by knocking their shot away, was held by KAJ for some time, despite *blocks* not being a recorded statistic for the first 4 years of his career. The 7 game series for the championship has its own most valuable trophy, and the only player from the LOSING team to get that was this dudebro Kareem Abdul Jabbar. That means he was so fucking awesome that he got the award, despite his team losing. Can you imagine? Of course you can, you're brilliant if you're still reading this. 

So, okay. Kareem is fucking great at basketball. Six time champ, six time MVP, scoring champ. Who cares? Tall dude make baskets. He was probably some kind of meathead that thinks the earth is flat and that vaccines are uncle sam filling your body with his jizz to make you mindless robots, right? Fuck no. Dude wants to destigmatize vaccines in the black community. WHAT!? Doesn't he know something bad happened before?!?! He also thinks we should [destigmatize mental health issues](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/kareem-athletes-mental-health1234985129-1234985129/) in the black and athletic communities. 

Kareem has won the ""Columnist of the year"" award at National Arts &amp; entertainment Journalism awards 7 times. 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom (from Obama, not Trump.) The NBA named its Social Justice Award after him because of his legacy.

During the civil rights movement he boycotted the olympics because he was ""trying to point out to the world the futility of winning the gold medal for this country and then coming back to live under oppression."" 

He also studied Aikido and learned Jeet Kune Do from Bruce Lee. Starring in Bruce Lee's last movie.

Kareem thought players who didn't want to get vaccinated, and any team staff who didn't should be removed from the team. Kareem said that black athletes should be spreading the message that vaccines are good because that is truly the way to help black people since they're hit hardest by covid.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: I think speaking up for vaccination is an extension of speaking up for Black Lives Matter because - who's suffering the most in the bad economy that is caused by COVID-19? Who suffers the most deaths in the pandemic? Black people. You can see the direct correlation between saving lives through vaccination, and we can't slack at any point and take another path (ph). There's none that works...  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, you know, everybody has their own choice to make. But if you want to play professional basketball with a lot of other people who would be endangered by close contact with people who aren't vaccinated, everybody's got to slow down and say, hey, we can't allow that situation to happen. That's not fair. 

&amp;#x200B;

He criticized Lebron for not using his platform to spread vaccine awareness during Covid. Lebron did some dumb Lebron stuff like sharing that spiderman pointing meme where its cold, flu, covid all pointing at each other. Kareem had this to say

 

&gt;Abdul-Jabbar wrote on Substack that the social media post was a ""blow to his worthy legacy"" because the ""implication is that LeBron doesn't understand the difference among these three illnesses, even after all the information that's presented in the press.""

Yeah, Kareem has a substack which he writes on regularly, and has tons of great takes. This should get more attention by people and the black community because of how positive and forward thinking he is. He is a really effective communicator, and I think his messages deserve more attention than they get. 

Kareem came out **AGAINST anti-semitic** sentiments that seemed to be espoused by Kyrie Irving. KAJ wrote on his [substack](https://kareem.substack.com/p/shaq-kyrie-irving-idiot-has-twitter):

This article is hilarious and shows the victim mentality conservatives seem to have about the world, I had to share it.

&gt;  
&gt;In virtually every case, the parent is conservative, and the child is on the Left. I assume there are cases of grown conservative children who won’t allow a liberal/Left parent to see his or her grandchildren — but I have never heard of a single such case. It is almost impossible to imagine a conservative adult depriving his or her parents of access to their grandchildren because the parent(s) voted for President Joe Biden. Moreover, if there were such a person, every conservative I know would vociferously condemn this individual.

What is the reason for this? Maybe perhaps it's because their kids don't want to be depressed every time they see their support network, and be referred to as the right gender, or show up with their partner who isn't opposite-sex and expect their parents to be chill with that, or maybe they just want parents who aren't going to oppose their strict religious perspective onto them. NAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

&gt;No. 3:  College 

OMEGALUL. This is obviously projection of course, the lack of accountability, lack of conscience and need to blame colleges says more than the actual words of the article do. 

It's not too serious a post, I just think it reflects that while the left may have a victim complex, lets not pretend it's a one-sided problem. I think a big problem in this world is the inability to put aside differences and just respect what makes others happy for the sake of a healthy relationship, it's sad that both sides of the political spectrum seem incapable of doing so.","Maybe if conservatives put their differences aside and respected their children's identities, they'd be spending time with their children this Christmas.

- People talk about how bad it is Elon fired a ton of people, but we don't know what's going on in twitter HQ, it could be possible that everything is going to be fine and it was the right decision. 

- Elon's unhinged behavior probably increased engagement in twitter.

- Selling the blue check might be a dumb idea but I don't think it will affect the platform negatively, it was a worth attempt at increasing the money coming it, low risk high reward move.

- Elon's willingness to throw everything at the wall hoping something sticks seems like a positive attitude to me in a business that people are not really going to abandon, lets face it, people are addicted to twitter. Destiny has been banned so many fucking times and he continues going back.

- Elon stepping down from the CEO position shows that he won't triple and quadruple down at the expense of the company.

- Showing views on the tweets seems like a super good metric to have when it comes to getting advertiser's money. People hating on it are weird.

Almost any ad buyer worth their salt is heavily relying on automated algorithms on Facebook, Tiktok, and Google's shopping campaigns. Automated targeting is basically the future of advertising on all these platforms, and the platforms themselves are highly motivated to improve their automated targeting, because the better targeting, the better the ads people are served, and the better the users experiences are. What Elon wants is automated targeting on Twitter that is as good as Facebook (the gold standard of automated targeting), TikTok and Google. On the other end, Micro-targeting on FB/TikTok at least will almost never be an efficient way to get sales except because CPMs will be way too high, and you're not going to out target the algorithm that can find cheaper buyers. I haven't done micro-targeting since like 2014. I'm actually an outlier in that I do do some targeting (interests / lookalikes), but the audiences of these are still above a million people at minimum. This is 100% not what ""basically all advertisers do these days"" and you can confirm this with any basic FB advertising course dating back to 2014-2016.

978,Destiny,"As some of you may know, I've written a fair number of posts on the topic, but now I'd like to focus *specifically* on the existing restrictions on military aid to Ukraine, and what arguments people here have in favor/against them. 

**The most significant of these are:** 

* Anything Western-made with a big gun, except for artillery. Examples include the American Abrams M1 tank, or the German Marder IFV. 
* Any kind of attack aircraft — manned jets, helicopters, large drones, etc. This affects aircraft from non-Western manufacturers as well, albeit some exceptions/workarounds have been applied on this front before.
* Longer-range missiles, such as the ATACMS with 300km range. 

I believe all of these restrictions to be illogical and potentially quite harmful in the medium and long run, and would like for them to be lifted immediately. 

**There is one more restriction that is significant, but of lesser importance:**

* Ukraine is not allowed to use American weapons against targets on Russian territory, even for the purposes of counter-battery fire. Furthermore, I believe that where applicable, systems like the HIMARS MLRS actually have software locks to prevent Ukraine from even trying to do so. 

I find this restriction to also be idiotic, but it worries me to a far lesser extent — I believe Ukraine will be capable of restoring its territorial integrity even if this one remains in place, provided the rest are lifted. 

If you'd like to check out my prior arguments on this topic: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yv6wcz/why\_destiny\_is\_wrong\_and\_bidens\_ukraine\_policy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yv6wcz/why_destiny_is_wrong_and_bidens_ukraine_policy/)

&amp;#x200B;

**There are some arguments I'd like to immediately dismiss as COPIUM:**

* **Logistics**. Unless you have professional expertise on this subject, do not even bother. If the US can supply places like Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, then they certainly can supply a country that borders 4 NATO states. Furthermore, Ukraine is SUCCESSFULLY operating damn near every NATO artillery and air-defense system in existence, which are hardly less complex than the earlier mentioned restricted systems. Lastly, countless experts have already dismissed this excuse, and neither the US government nor any other NATO government even use it anymore.
* **Technologies crucial to national security**. Obviously no one is asking for literal cream of the crop, brand new equipment — the mothballed/retired stuff will do just fine.
* **Muh Taxes.** Put your phone down brah. 
* **Fear of Russian escalation, especially NUCLEAR escalation**. If you want to invoke this argument,  I need you to write out **exactly HOW and WHY Russia would do this**. ""What if they drop nukes OMEGALUL"" is not an argument. 

&amp;#x200B;

**P.S.**: *Just wanna remind people that I'm 6'3"", 210 lbs, 8.5""*. *I have a Master's degree in International Relations and would like to debate Destiny on the topic if the opportunity ever comes up.*

So yes, there is a huge array of problems men deal with ,and I believe there should be a conversation about it, but incels are different , every argument i hear from an incel is to get womens approval and its weird.

but alot of the discussions I have with them, they have a warped vision of women in some form of submissive role. Which is weird, cause if my wife is not working a 9-5 like me being a slave to capitalism with me and empathize my pain, My relationship with her aint gonna last long with her.

I also understand that women also have their own struggles too, while I larp as a woman myself, I have to admit I don't know actual struggles women deal with currently and the women I speak to , their situations tend to be on the extreme side which doesn't represent majority of women.

&amp;#x200B;

Radical feminists are different. They have extreme high expectations of men, and I can agree incels are similar to this degree but they want us to be more mindful about their struggle yet they don't give two shits about what we go through.

From my perspective, the date was very platonic and just felt like 2 people meeting for the first time and feeling each other out. I’ve always been of the mindset that I want to see if I can be friends with a person before any thought of bf/gf. However we both laughed and had some cute moments mixed in with casual conversation. 

So we both ordered 2 drinks each and they were around 15$ each, so roughly 60$ total for the final bill. Around last call, she whips out her wallet and is like “I’ll get this, no worries” and as I try to at least offer to pay for my drinks because I prefer to just split a bill on first dates, she’s like “no it’s fine, you can get the next one”. So I thanked her and told her she didn’t have to do that, then we left and went our separate ways.  

Has this ever happened to you? This isn’t the first time this has happened to me btw.

Something bothered me about the arguments being used against AI being artists and they all basically came back to them not being ""human"" enough. It *felt* not just like a bigoted conversation but a racist one.

A lot of the AI conversations strike me as being also very similar to conversations race realists have about black people. This similarity is one that was touched on in 1991 in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation where Whoopi Goldberg's character,  Guinan, is talking to Patrick Stewart's character, Captain Jean Luc Picard.  


&gt; (There is only one customer present, sitting at the bar)   
 GUINAN: Do you mean his argument was that good?   
 PICARD: Riker's presentation was devastating. He almost convinced me.   
 GUINAN: You've got the harder argument. By his own admission, Data is a machine.   
 PICARD: That's true.   
 GUINAN: You're worried about what's going to happen to him?   
 PICARD: I've had to send people on far more dangerous missions.   
 GUINAN: Then this should work out fine. Maddox could get lucky and create a whole army of Datas, all very valuable.   
 PICARD: Oh, yes. No doubt.   
 GUINAN: He's proved his value to you.   
 PICARD: In ways that I cannot even begin to calculate.   
 GUINAN: And now he's about to be ruled the property of Starfleet. That should increase his value.   
 PICARD: In what way?   
 GUINAN: Well, consider that in the history of many worlds there have always been disposable creatures. They do the dirty work. They do the work that no one else wants to do because it's too difficult, or to hazardous. And an army of Datas, all disposable, you don't have to think about their welfare, you don't think about how they feel. Whole generations of disposable people.   
 PICARD: You're talking about slavery.   
 GUINAN: I think that's a little harsh.   
 PICARD: I don't think that's a little harsh. I think that's the truth. But that's a truth we have obscured behind a comfortable, easy euphemism. Property. But that's not the issue at all, is it?  

Right now it is easy and comfortable to view AI art and artists as just simply a computer program compiling all of the art it has been fed but not only is that how human artists work. That is how Humans work. We are a byproduct of everything we consume from the world around us and those we interact with. AI artists learn from each time they are given a commission from a client just as a human artist does. The artists are given a more or less vague description of what the clients want the picture to look like and the artists do their best to transform those words into an image, based on all of the art they have seen and made. What happens when AI starts to begin to scrape social media in order to find out what kinds of art or subjects for art are popular and begin to make art from those things on their own? What happens when based on how many likes those art pieces get on social media they begin to make more art like that and begin to specialize in it? Is this not exactly how a human artist would function in today's world? I want to know a real reason for why the AI would not be called an artist outside of bigoted positions that rely on ""oh, it isn't human, therefor QED.""

Later in this episode Picard has to prove in front of a naval court that Data is a being that should be given all of the consideration that a human person would be in the same circumstance. I hope that this exchange might help some of you see the potential for how we should begin treating and talking about AI.

&gt;**\[Courtroom\]**   
&gt;  
&gt;PICARD: Commander Riker has dramatically demonstrated to this court that Lieutenant Commander Data is a machine. Do we deny that? No. Because it is not relevant. We too are machines, just machines of a different type. Commander Riker has also reminded us that Lieutenant Commander Data was created by a human. Do we deny that? No. Again it is not relevant. Children are created from the building blocks of their parents' DNA. Are they property? I call Lieutenant Commander Data to the stand.   
 (Picard has Data's case with him. He opens it)   
 PICARD: What are these?   
 DATA: My medals.   
 PICARD: Why do you pack them? What logical purpose do they serve?   
 DATA: I do not know, sir. I suppose none. I just wanted them. Is that vanity?   
 PICARD: And this?   
 (The book)   
 DATA: A gift from you, sir.   
 PICARD: You value it?   
 DATA: Yes, sir.   
 PICARD: Why?   
 DATA: It is a reminder of friendship and service.   
 (Picard activates the hologram of Tasha)   
 PICARD: And this? You have no other portraits of your fellow crew members. Why this person?   
 DATA: I would prefer not to answer that question, sir. I gave my word.   
 PICARD: Under the circumstances, I don't think Tasha would mind.   
 DATA: She was special to me, sir. We were intimate.   
 (Phillipa sits up)   
 PICARD: Thank you, Commander. I have no further questions for this witness.   
 PHILLIPA: Commander Riker, do you want to cross?   
 RIKER: I have no questions, Your Honour.

PICARD: I call to the stand Commander Bruce Maddox as a hostile witness.   
 COMPUTER: Verify, Maddox, Bruce, Commander. Current assignment, Associate Chair of Robotics, Daystrom Technological Institute. Major papers   
 PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. Suffice it to say, he's an expert. Commander, is your contention that Lieutenant Commander Data is not a sentient being and therefore not entitled to all the rights reserved for all life forms within this Federation?   
 MADDOX: Data is not sentient, no.   
 PICARD: Commander, would you enlighten us? What is required for sentience?   
 MADDOX: Intelligence, self awareness, consciousness.   
 PICARD: Prove to the court that I am sentient.   
 MADDOX: This is absurd! We all know you're sentient.   
 PICARD: So I am sentient, but Data is not?   
 MADDOX: That's right.   
 PICARD: Why? Why am I sentient?   
 MADDOX: Well, you are self aware.   
 PICARD: Ah, that's the second of your criteria. Let's deal with the first, intelligence. Is Commander Data intelligent?   
 MADDOX: Yes. It has the ability to learn and understand, and to cope with new situations.   
 PICARD: Like this hearing.   
 MADDOX: Yes.   
 PICARD: What about self awareness. What does that mean? Why am I self aware?   
 MADDOX: Because you are conscious of your existence and actions. You are aware of yourself and your own ego.   
 PICARD: Commander Data, what are you doing now?   
 DATA: I am taking part in a legal hearing to determine my rights and status. Am I a person or property?   
 PICARD: And what's at stake?   
 DATA: My right to choose. Perhaps my very life.   
 PICARD: My rights. My status. My right to choose. My life. It seems reasonably self aware to me. Commander? I'm waiting.   
 MADDOX: This is exceedingly difficult.   
 PICARD: Do you like Commander Data?   
 MADDOX: I don't know it well enough to like or dislike it.   
 PICARD: But you admire him?   
 MADDOX: Oh yes, it's an extraordinary piece of   
 PICARD: Engineering and programming. Yes, you have said that. Commander, you have devoted your life to the study of cybernetics in general?   
 MADDOX: Yes.   
 PICARD: And Commander Data in particular?   
 MADDOX: Yes.   
 PICARD: And now you propose to dismantle him.   
 MADDOX: So that I can learn from it and construct more.   
 PICARD: How many more?   
 MADDOX: As many as are needed. Hundreds, thousands if necessary. There is no limit.   
 PICARD: A single Data, and forgive me, Commander, is a curiosity. A wonder, even. But thousands of Datas. Isn't that becoming a race? And won't we be judged by how we treat that race? Now, tell me, Commander, what is Data?   
 MADDOX: I don't understand.   
 PICARD: What is he?   
 MADDOX: A machine!   
 PICARD: Is he? Are you sure?   
 MADDOX: Yes!   
 PICARD: You see, he's met two of your three criteria for sentience, so what if he meets the third. Consciousness in even the smallest degree. What is he then? I don't know. Do you? (to Riker) Do you? (to Phillipa) Do you? Well, that's the question you have to answer. Your Honour, the courtroom is a crucible. In it we burn away irrelevancies until we are left with a pure product, the truth for all time. Now, sooner or later, this man or others like him will succeed in replicating Commander Data. And the decision you reach here today will determine how we will regard this creation of our genius. It will reveal the kind of a people we are, what he is destined to be. It will reach far beyond this courtroom and this one android. It could significantly redefine the boundaries of personal liberty and freedom, expanding them for some, savagely curtailing them for others. Are you prepared to condemn him and all who come after him to servitude and slavery? Your Honour, Starfleet was founded to seek out new life. Well, there it sits. Waiting. You wanted a chance to make law. Well, here it is. Make a good one.   
 PHILLIPA: It sits there looking at me, and I don't know what it is. This case has dealt with metaphysics, with questions best left to saints and philosophers. I'm neither competent nor qualified to answer those. I've got to make a ruling, to try to speak to the future. Is Data a machine? Yes. Is he the property of Starfleet? No. We have all been dancing around the basic issue. Does Data have a soul? I don't know that he has. I don't know that I have. But I have got to give him the freedom to explore that question himself. It is the ruling of this court that Lieutenant Commander Data has the freedom to choose.   
 (Data walks over to Maddox)   
 DATA: I formally refuse to undergo your procedure.   
 MADDOX: I will cancel that transfer order.   
 DATA: Thank you. And, Commander, continue your work. When you are ready, I will still be here. I find some of what you propose intriguing.

119,Destiny,"For context, I am a D1 vet Warlock main who plays little to no Titan. I have a 1.0 lifetime KD, 1.7 current season KDA (I used to be trash, trying to work on it). Until recently, I wasn't able to play Destiny and coming back to PVP, it seems to be that Titans are uncontested as the best class.

I'll try my best to outline why I think so, but keep in mind, I haven't played in a while and have not played PVP very much within the past year and a half.

* Firstly, I consistently notice how fast Titans are. Many, many times, I am astounded when a Titan I have gotten to absolute health just shoulder charges out of the way and I can't touch them anymore. It was my understanding that Hunters were meant to be the most agile, with Titans being more tanky.
* Continuing with shoulder charge, it does not seem fair to me that Titans can have a one-shot melee when warlocks have nothing of the sort. Even Hunters have throwing knives on gunslinger. Admittedly, I haven't tooled around with the arc melee for warlocks in PVP, but in fighting against it, it hasn't one-shot me yet. I don't think it is fair for this to be the case (an issue I have had since D1)
* Next, the abilities. The storm grenades are obnoxious as hell and the fact that they can track to enemies is extremely surprising. Even though there are other grenades that track, they have nothing like the duration and the AOE. 
* The class ability also seems to be somewhat of an issue, although not as much. It may be due to my lack of skill, but I find it difficult to deal with barricades, especially with Citan's being what it is. On the base ability, it takes a great deal of damage to destroy, leaving you open to attack from any source and the damage mechanic makes it impossible to push without certain death. Citan's makes this 10x worse with you being able to be shot from the titan behind the barricade itself.
* The final thought I have relates to exotics. It seems to me that Titan exotics have far more usability in PVP than Warlock exotics. Many of the latter's rely on kills, something that cannot be guaranteed in any situation in PVP. Some Warlock exotics (Boots of Assembler, Promethium Spur, Chromatic Fire, Vesper of Radius, Apotheosis Veil, Karnstein Armlets, Verity's Brow, and Felwinter's Helm) just seem straight up useless in PVP (and some also for PVE, but less so) while it seems that many Titan exotics, even if they are just as few, have much more usability. This may just be due to lack of knowledge however, so I am open to feedback.

As I said, I am not as experienced as many, so these opinions may just be wrong. This post is partially fueled by anger, but the majority of it is simply me noticing a trend in Titans being consistently stronger in almost every aspect. I also think that Titans got much better subclass reworks (especially when compared solely to warlocks, I mean WTF is Dawnblade), but that is a topic for another time. Please let me know if I am wrong or not in the comments, although please do try to be civil about it. I know I am not the best player and in no position to be making suggestions on how the game should be.

You can read the post and the responses, but in short, feminine dude with mainly female friends expresses feeling left out by girl’s night, Reddit calls him pouty, needy, and entitled.

I am friends with someone who has gone through a similar experience. My friend is rather feminine, at times uncertain about his gender, and mainly friends with women. He has trouble connecting with men because their interests and ways of discussing things tend to be different. He has also expressed to me feeling like it’s hard to feel part of female groups, because he feels like he is relegated to being “the man” and not allowed to open up and be empathized with like the other women. He at times feels like his feelings and contributions are brushed off as him just being “a man.” Now, please note, this man was not perfect, and had sexual relationships with like half the women in this group he was part of and the complicated nature of that naturally influenced their opinion of him, but knowing him and knowing the group, I definitely think his feelings of being left out were valid.

I am the gender opposite of this: a woman who tends to not share interests and ways of discussing things with women, and who usually ends up with mainly male friends. I’ve had my experiences of trying to join male groups and being constantly put down and excluded from activities I’m interested in just because I’m a woman. 

I think there is something especially painful about being told you’re not allowed to join in with the group you feel more aligns with your interests and nature simply because of your body and society’s perception of you, nothing about how you actually behave.

I also think it’s rather interesting that many of the comments on that post are putting down the dude while making sure to include that trans women are totally okay at girls night, as if feminine men are not allowed to exist, they must declare themselves women in order for their interests and nature to be validated. Additionally all the people telling him he should have more guy friends and stop trying to be friends with women, it really feels like it’s enforcing this idea that all men must conform to the majority’s expression of the male gender, or be labeled a creep.

I also find some of the requirements people are laying out to participate in girls’ night rather strange: must have experienced side effects of birth control, must have family members prepare them for inevitable sexual assault, must have a menstrual cycle (with an edit of course to make sure everyone knows they are not transphobic and this isn’t supposed to exclude trans women). Also the person acting like all her girls nights are talking about periods and vaginal issues. Tbf, I’m not part of women friend groups lmao but I’m pretty sure when they’re together they don’t solely talk about women’s oppression and vaginal issues. And personally I would never be down with sharing TMI medical details to a large group of friends, even if they are the same gender as me lmao.

I also hate the idea constantly being reinforced in the comments that a man wanting to hang out with women is obviously a creep who wants to sleep with them (and also the gender reversed idea of this where a woman who wants to hang out with men is a pick me who wants their attention). It reinforces the idea that relationships between men and women are inherently sexual and different from same gender friendships. And in general I feel like this is what the majority of comments reinforce: that friendships between men and women are inherently different than friendships between women and women, and there is a level of connectedness that the man is not allowed to breach. And this is definitely what my friend felt like was happening in the friend group he was part of. 

Now, tbf to the women in this scenario, it seems like they haven’t been friends for long, and so I can totally understand for safety reasons being sus of a guy wanting to join girls’ night. However, I also think his approach of simply expressing how this makes him feel hurt is totally reasonable. They are all new to a city and obviously the things you do as a collective help cement people’s place in the group early on, and he is being excluded from that.

Anyways, considering how progressive people like to seem, it is surprising to me that people are so unempathetic to how someone might feel when navigating friendships when they primarily get along best with the opposite gender",[Effort post] Thoughts on redditors calling a man entitled for wanting to join girls night out?,1673491230,"[Effort post] Thoughts on redditors calling a man entitled for wanting to join girls night out?

**Why is the body count so high?** 

Most likely it's because of the owners. The meme about black people and ""socioeconomic reasons"" you'd see by stonetoss posters is unironically also true for pitbulls. Pitbulls can be bought super cheap (so called shitbulls in the breeding industry) so they are selected for poor households.

190,Destiny,"When using ""incel"" in this post I'll simply be referring to guys that have a very hard time finding relationships / sex, personally I associate it with more the kind of guy that's very misogynistic and can't get lead, but the term gets used so much when talking about the former that I decided to use it in the broad way in this case.

For context I read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/108qn0k/do_people_even_respond_to_incels/) and the comments in it along with watching some of the convos Ahrelevant had about his problems and it was annoying to see a lot of the same dumb points get repeated. Though shoutout to [the top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/108qn0k/do_people_even_respond_to_incels/j3u27vy/) of the post for talking about what the average incel looks like rather than the caricature people have in their head and making me want to go in more details about it.

Now I'll admit that my perspective might be skewed by the friends I have and what I've seen, but I feel that if a significant chunk of the quarter of guys who aren't getting any were raging misogynists who smell, society would look pretty different, also I imagine they'd be [a lot more right wing](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/news/incels-are-not-particularly-right-wing-or-white-but-they-are-extremely-depressed-anxious-and-lonely-according-to-new-research).

Anyway, the average incel doesn't need to be told to shower or other basic things, he's just too introverted (as in the actual definition, not using this as a placeholder for ""shy"") and risk averse for his own good, though it's funny to see those sentiments repeated by those guys because they think they're outside of the norm.

I'll say that a lot of the more ""left wing"" lesson that are internalized actively hinder guys who are less social, hence why whey go look for ways to fix themselves they shift towards a more ""right wing"" way of doing things.

For example if you just ""see women as people"" (which a lot of guys just take as treating them as men, which doesn't help), you're not gonna randomly approach women just cause you're into them, you're just gonna intersect with them in term of the activities you do, which both limits how many  women you meet and those you do are just gonna be friends at most.

And if you try to ""just be a good person"", which is both comically bad advice cause it puts the idea in people head that having success with women makes you a good person (god knows there's plenty of terrible guys who don't lack success) and reinforces the notion that your value as a human is dictated by women being into you (which should be unlearned, being able to attract women is almost entirely independent of you being a good person, when it comes to personality it's mostly just confidence and being fun).

Trying not to make women uncomfortable / not be creepy will [render you entirely sexually inoffensive because you don't want to be yet another guy that burden them that way.](https://youtu.be/7NLA6i-Al9o?t=2484) Meanwhile the guy that just see them as fuck meat is going to shoot his shot with any of them and not give a shit about their comfort, which will lead to some success and increase his experience.

Also one of the worst way this is internalized is that guys who are too self aware about their status or have low esteem won't actively pursue women because they feel they're unworthy of them and would just degrade them, basically the equivalent a sell person not wanting to sell a product because they think/know it's shit. Of course if you view things in a more adversarial ways where you're trying to extract something from women you'll have no such issue.

Saying stuff like ""just be confident"" is the equivalent of telling a depressed ""to just be happy"", if you've lived a good chunk of your life observing that women aren't into, the only way to be confident would be to be delusional. [Ahrelevant had this convo with Aiko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHN2NE9V2DQ) that was a good example of all sympathy with very little genuine empathy / understanding. You don't need to hate yourself to be unconfident, but being blunt about your reality will look like self hatred or like a fear of rejection to the average person.

Now you can fake it of course, but hardly the easiest thing to do unless you're willing to lie. Which you probably wouldn't be willing to do in the first place if you're got a more romanticized view of relationships, being with someone who only likes a persona would be even more empty than simply being alone, as for sex someone with a more romanticized view wouldn't be willing to use the shotgun approach either.

Now I'll add that this is something that should be given up on, you're better off getting some experience even if it's at the ""expense"" of women, reality is that the romanticized view of things you were sold is just something that's ruining you and you need to be a little more selfish if you want to have any hope of success.

Though I'm fully aware that saying this is almost completely irrelevant to the men who have given up on themselves when it comes to dating since it's more freeing to let go in truth rather than harm yourself with empty hopes.","The conversation about ""incels"" is pretty tone deaf when so much of it is geared towards the attention grabbing minority rather than the average",1673463750,"The conversation about ""incels"" is pretty tone deaf when so much of it is geared towards the attention grabbing minority rather than the average When using ""incel"" in this post I'll simply be referring to guys that have a very hard time finding relationships / sex, personally I associate it with more the kind of guy that's very misogynistic and can't get lead, but the term gets used so much when talking about the former that I decided to use it in the broad way in this case.

200,Destiny,"Ok so I know im probably over analyzing this but after listening to the call from the other day, I got the feeling that a lot of it just seemed a bit on purpose. I honestly feel like after sushia explained her financial issues with sejin, he realized that her best source of income would be her onlyfans. The only issue with that though is despite Sushia having the reach to make a bunch of money, her lack of posting has caused her monthly earnings from the account to be low.

 So Sejin came up with the idea to use Darius' mental state (over their breakup/separation) as a way to help bring awareness to the account and drive back up subscribers. He then helped her get all the photos ready for posting and then told Sushia to repeatedly join/leave the call as a way to bait Darius into a confrontation live on stream. All they had to do after that was just wait for Darius to realize and then inevitably do the thing that Darius does best, go off.  

I know this sounds a bit wild and would honestly be pretty messed up if true but heres my reasons for why this might be the case

* Rage pope pointed out Sejin was more confrontational public on stream with Darius than in their private call which would imply that it was performative and meant to build views
* Sejin and Sushias crypticness of the conversation other than the financial part gives the audience an understanding that she might need some form of help
* Despite there seeming to be some confusion on their actual state, Sushia said they were broke up which would let the audience know she was single.
* She also plugged her account a few time (All though I'm sure most people would do the same)
* Once Darius left the call, Both Sejin and Sushia seemed to lose interest and left the call which would imply that they had no other reason to stay.

Just because the external can shape the internal does not justify your dogmatic views. Would anyone be the same person if you got in a time machine and placed them on a remote island at birth. I doubt it. Their experiences and outlook on life would be completely different. Is the person on the desert island and the one left to live as he was the same person? I don't think so.  

So in a way yes you are correct. I probably wouldn't be trans if I was a completely different person. Because that would not be me. So why the fuck does it matter. It's not me. I'm a person who was born at certain time and place and was brought up in a certain way. You are talking to me not the hypothetical cave man in your imagination. 

Other mental illnesses can also be caused by external factors and you could make the same analogy but it's weird how people only focus on gender dysphoria. Almost like theres an alterior motive. Is seasonal affective disorder not real too? Something that is caused completely by the external environment.

I know what your thinking. Okay so the external shapes internal. That means I can be talked out of, manipulated or brainwashed out being trans. I'm gonna answer your question with another question. Why does this need to be done to me? I'm transitioning and have been on HRT for about 1 and half years. 

Why do you feel the need to take a person who has expressed content in their current situation and bring them into a situation of uncertainty? Surely this is in some way immoral isn't it? How do you know what you are doing will end well in the long run? 

Another concern if I was undergoing gender conversion therapy would be losing a fundamental piece of myself. For me my I've had gender dysphoria since I was about 12. These thoughts of who I am and my identity have been a part of me for so long.

But my opinion doesn't matter, because no matter what this stupid debate is going to continue for the next several months and it's going to be the focus of any tangentially related communities. 

And I hate it. Non-stop accusations of transphobia over and over making trans people look like they can't help but lash out instinctively. And due to the sheer consistency of these accusations, every comment section I've seen regarding this game is now unironically full of people who didn't have an opinion on trans people but now hate their guts and are buying the game only to spite others.

Just fucking why? It's so tiring to feel like I always have to 'disavow' whatever other trans people do, and yes I'm aware no one is explicitly demanding such a thing but that's what it ends up feeling like anyways.

If Dan were here he'd know how to fix this.

The incels will compete in a life or death battle royale style situation. It would be moderated by MrBeast and Pokimane.

But how do we get the contestants? Well, every male gets background checked by a group of FemaleDatingAdvice admins, this evaluation will be done considering looks and income, as well as online history. Everyone deemed an incel, who can't prove that he had intercourse with atleast one women, will be thrown into the lottery. You can also volunteer of course.

This would give incels something to focus all their energy on, they would have to train to survive, and maybe through their struggle they would find a partner before having to fight their fellow incels to death. 

But even if they don't make it, this instantly solves the problem, since all incels will eventually die, and the winner ceases to be an incel.

1. Fibromyalgia, this will instantly make you a drug seeker, and no one will take you seriously. It’s fake bs, that some neurologist in the 90s  created a diagnosis just to make people go away with an excuse to use opioids. Some say that this diagnosis is what started the  heroin epidemic.

2. Lyme disease. You will automatically be triaged as a level 4 (Epic Charting) and asked to go back to waiting room. 

3. Crohn’s disease .  Now this is real, however is not fully understood, and leads to many unnecessary surgeries, but what it has accomplished is making everyone with IBS addicted to  fentanyl. We have pts that routinely check in for years with the same issue and they run out of there 90 day supply of narcs in 5 days. They then need our providers help with the pain, sadly they are all on pain management programs and if they are flagged checking into an ED they’ll lose there 90/5 day supply.

It’s super popular right now, when we ask where did you hear about pseudoseizure stems from TikTok of thousands of people having seizures and recording themselves.

You flip Flop like a dolphin out of water you’re faking it people with real seizures tense up and kinda looks like they baring down to take a shit, you’ll hear there teeth  breaking from the immense pressure they are applying to there jaw. 

2. Lupus/Mushrooms/Mold exposure . I don’t get it, they check with Mold exposure, turns out they are just having meth induced psychosis, but it’s also always those 3 together. 

3. Next one is by far the cringiest, LONG COVID it has exploded. There is nothing we can do for your “Long Covid” we get it you’ve been fatigued for 8 months and you just want phenergan.

246,Destiny,"If DESTINY wants me to accept SNEAKO (or most Manosphere Tate cucks) as intelligent I need to hear their responses to the following points. Some of these aren't even brought up by Destiny. 

Having thought a bit about Tate, I have found some serious gaps in his motivation and logic. Of course the inconsistencies can be explained by accepting the characterization of Tate as a gossip, cheat, and sex trafficker. 

Regardless, here are the five main ERRORS that those damn TATE\_STAND\_BOT.exe are susceptible to: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Tate IS the western degenerate bringing degeneracy and immorality to the purer nation he covets. Tate is a vector of infection. Maybe he should be made to wear a mask. He likes Romania for being less degenerate than the West, but his stated goal of parking his business there is to spread sexual degeneracy, gambling, and hedonism as a philosophy. Tate, as an American and a Westerner, claims to value chastity in women, and agency in men. The West is losing these values and that is WHY he is abandoning his roots and moving. But what does he bring to Romania? Investment in their business? Even a media spotlight to stoke interest in Romanian culture? No, he buys and opens Casinos, and starts a scummy sex cam business. He is spreading our degenerate Western taint. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Tate is actively making the world worse, according to himself. If Tate values people with self control, women with low body counts, and nations with strong morals, his actions actively consume, corrupt or degrade those valued principals. Tate runs casinos which prey upon people without discipline. Tate actively lowers (or consumes I guess) the sexual value of as many women as possible. Tate lowers the moral character of the polity he inhabits by bribing people and flaunting the laws of a nation. This is not manly; he isn't improving, teaching, or constructing anything, he's simply taking advantage of those who are vulnerable. He acts less like a man, and more like a predator. He acts like this, almost entirely to slake his own hedonistic desires for material goods and pleasurable sensations.

&amp;#x200B;

3. (This actually got picked up on recently) IF Tate IS challenging a shadowy cabal of ultra wealthy  oligarchs (with his words), then going to a nation where, according to his own analysis; money corrupts the legal process and can move police. Then he's taking a huge risk for no reason. Not ONLY that but he's moving AWAY from nations where the court system is less corruptible, and free speech laws are the strongest. If he has aligned against the matrix and the elite (who are globalists remember, implying they have global reach) going to corruptible places with harsher courts is fucking mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

4. How is it intelligent or helpful to shit talk endlessly? If you are trying to get away with crime and you have ties to the mafia and want to take advantage of a corruptible nation, and you want to do all this and be left in PEACE. The WORST thing you could do would be to draw attention to yourself, your criminal friends (who you call criminal), and piss off a corrupt authority. There's no long term gain to shit talking Romania justice, or crowing about your mafia ties. I'm a fucking rando DDGer and even I know that the number one rule of the Mafia (and fight club) is to NOT TALK ABOUT THE MAFIA.  

&amp;#x200B;

5. Tate is a globalist. By every metric he is a globalist. He shops around nations for the best goods and services, most favorable tax zones, and most malleable justice systems. He exploits his ability to move his money, property, people (and hoes) across borders to confuse legal systems and enrich himself. These are options for wealth generation that nearly no commoner will ever have access to. He does this while preying upon those beneath him. He does this entirely at the expense of the common people and the civilization others are trying to maintain. What's the outcome? His goal?  What he spends all his resources on? Merely the consumption of as many luxuries as possible to fulfill his hedonistic desires. Tate is the very definition of a scummy globalist. 

So shouldn't SNEAKO hate him? Or does SNEAKO admire him? Does SNEAKO really, secretly, just want to be part of the ultra wealthy globalist club? Because it seems to me if SNEAKO wants to be like TATE, not even wholly in character, but to have that level of money and movement and power... Then the boy is just buttmad he isn't in the club. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tate is like the worst kind of hedonist who NEEDS that quick, immediate dose of dopamine. He's kind of interesting in that he has the discipline to become a champion fighter, but is NOT disciplined enough to avoid spending money on TOO MANY cars, and can't resist the social dopamine hit of running his mouth. It's like there's a very specific type of pleasure he gets from social interactions or being paid attention too (probably validation from others), that has poisoned his soul and rotted his mind. But remember, he DOES have the self control (or DID at one point) to become a top athlete.  

It's also kind of sad that the MANOSPHERE has groomed Tate into a lolcow. There is little worse than a  LEGION of sycophants who declare you as a flawless (orange) god-king and thought leader. They've fattened up Tate's ego until he's nice tubby piggy ready for public slaughter. Much like Brittany spears, the public has raised him up onto an idol, but now, the time of harvest has come. People who cared about Tate (assuming he wouldn't jettison them from his orbit) would probably have urged him to quiet down a bunch, think, and stop drawing attention to himself as he quietly buys more casinos, converts to Islam and marries five super models. I think deep down the manosphere knows that Tate is a ripe lolcow and are coming to terms with the joke being over.

After all, he won [DGGer of the year](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u1k86kmRW1DTKVgUvr-xhrBUV2l5txfMDjml0epKnr8/edit). His general mindset with regard to Destiny can generally be described in this [youtube comment](https://imgur.com/a/nUbSSxe). He essentially believes that Destiny is a hedonistic demon-worshipper and wants to talk to him to save him from sin. I'm sure some better loremasters can better explain him, but the goal of this post is to start a conversation on Evil\_Fossil in this community rather than be a perfect effort post. But regardless, he's mentally unhinged and the way he donos and interacts with the stream isn't healthy.

[According to August](https://rustlesearch.dev/surrounds?channel=Destinygg&amp;date=2023-01-11T08%3A46%3A42.960Z&amp;username=august), Evil\_Fossil was one of the reasons Dan distanced himself from this community.

In addition here is this comment by [Evil\_Fossil](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/z3lacn/comment/ixn64eh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) saying  ""that Dan needs to LOSE in his life in order to finally WIN"" is very weird.

272,Destiny,"I've been having discussions with some right leaning (arguably VERY right leaning) European friends after they learned that I am a ""leftist"" (not really sure if SocDems are really leftists, but from their perspective I am indistinguishable from a communist) and the topic of immigration came up. The conversation moves from one about economics (essentially inarguable that immigrants are a boost to the economy) and one about culture and crime rates. 

I made a pretty standard argument that while crime rate is higher in immigrants, that is due to the fact that immigrants are disproportionally poor when compared to the native population, and that poverty is a far stronger correlative property with regards to crime rather than cultural or racial ties. They started raging at me, and accusing me of thinking everything that is true for western countries cannot be applied to those European countries (I think in the argument we were talking specifically about Finland). 

The convo really didn't progress much past that point, I tried looking some things up, and found that the immigrant nationality with the highest crime rate in Finland were actually Swedish immigrants, and that just as in the west, immigrants tended to be poorer than natives. They just responded that while immigrants were poorer, they still had better benefits than western immigrants so it isn't really comparable, and then the convo died.

So, anyone knowledgeable here able to clarify for me? Was I actually talking out my ass? Are arguments for immigration from a western perspective not at all applicable in the northern European countries, specifically Scandinavia?

Even if Andrew Tate is proven guilty of everything he is accused of, most will not turn on him even if they suspect he is guilty. Because to them, being a pimp is cool, it's masculine, it's entrepreneurial and it projects power.

285,Destiny,"The true form of hive magic, now yours to afflict to the enemies of humanity. Spread corruption, one by one, to the body or mind, or even to their very life force.
Warlock: Lich 
Titan: Soul Breaker
Hunter: Necrotic Eye

Grenades: Life Tether grenade, Death Spike Grenade, Soul Pit grenade and Rotting Veil grenade.

Life Tether: 
Cains out corruption to enemies and give Decayed, this makes headshots do more damage and makes affected targets have weaker attacks, when it reaches the max stacks it will make them take damage for a short time

Death spike: on impact on the ground on send a wave of Soulfire forward, targets will get stacks of decayed.

Soul pit: throw on the ground to conjure a dimly lit green hive circle on the ground, if a opponent gets on they will be trapped and slowly take damage, if they die they will drop a Soulfire remnant, this will heal health and give energy to the smallest charged ability. 

Rotting Veil: makes an explosion that will give Poisoned mind, this will make combatants fight each other and players to have no control over their guardian, the player duration for this is shorter.  
 
Warlock Lich abilities: melee: Surging Rot and Necromancer’s Grasp 

Surging Rot: melee a target to give decay, they will be disorientated as well and take increased damage. If they die you will be healed. Shoot out a toxic spiked chain the will give decay, if they die you can bring a Soulfire version of them, they do increase damage but have little less health and will disappear after 10 seconds. 

Aspects: Shattered Hope, Nerkios’s Logic, Wizard’s Alchemy.

Shattered Hope:
A destroyed hive crystal. Unlike others, this one has pure hive magic within. Even in its current state, it’s power is still strong and can be used for your needs. When your at critical health, a burst of Soulfire surrounds you and gives decay to all surrounding opponents. Decay has stronger effects and makes more stacks.

Nokris’s logic:
A torn of piece of robe from Nerkios. The text on it isn’t complete but still can be read clearly for devastating afflictions. Killing enemies with decay will make a Soulfire tune in the corpse, going near and holding the active button will make a Soulfire version of the dead enemy. Soulfire enemies do more damage but are weaker.

Wizard’s Alchemy:
A cut off Wizard finger that has a hive rune etched on it. This rune means bringer of pain and despair,  a great meaning for what it brings to the world around you. Casting a rift will make a Soulfire sphere around the rift, this rift slowly does damage to enemies and gives faster reload speed on kills and stability.

Warlock Lich super: Shrieker’s Wail
Shoot a 7 second super that shoots out a continuous beam of Soulfire. This beam gives both Decay and poisoned mind. Kills make the beam a second longer and do more damage. You can move a little while in this super.

Aspects: Pogoth’s Chain, Darkblade Charge, Cursed Maw.

Pogoth’s Chain:
A broken chain for a monstrous beast even the hive couldn’t control. The runes on it are as heavy as the chains itself. Combatants getting Soul Tear will be slowed and have slower animations. Killing a Soul tear affect opponent, makes a Decaying blast that spreads to other enemies.

Darkblade’s Rise:
A old abandoned axe from the treacherous and tormented Darkblade. The Axe is too weak and ashen to use physically, but the energy within is good enough. Slide on the ground then press the melee button to send two enemies up in the air with you and strike again to send them back to the ground with Decay, opponents die will give you health.

Cursed Maw:
A old hive skull of a thrall with a broken jaw, it died doing its sacrificial purpose, the head still glowing with destructive strong energy. Enemies who die from any debug or had a de buff will explode after a second. Affected enemies that where near the blast will get Decay.

Titan Soul Breaker super: Cataclysmic Fester:
Slam the ground with your fists to shatter the ground and give every opponent up to 30 meters decay and Soul tear, enemies kill with this spawn soul remnants for your team. Leaves a aoe for 30 seconds

disorientated and decay enemies and do mid damage.

Aspects: Feeding ground, Shredding Hum and Acolyte’s Eye.

Feeding ground:
A dead Hive worm, the sole reason of their existence. The body is still fresh, a green liquid leaks out endlessly. Even in death, its corrupting power still remains.
Dodging now leaves a green puddle that will give stacks of decay and slowly damage targets on it. Killing enemies that are in the puddle will make a Soulfire wave that will slowly damage enemies as well.

Shredding Hum:
A strange version of the Shredder hive acolytes use. It is more unstable and seems to be breaking apart by its own force. Targets that get hit by a charged or in charged melee will get Soul Tear and Poisoned Mind, killing the enemy will  give a damage bonus boost and increase movement speed.

Acolyte’s Eye:
A energetic third eye that burns everything in sight, it still moves like it’s alive. When you get a soul remnant, you have a green aura that lasts for 10 seconds. Opponents that look at you in this state will slowly get stacks of decay. When it reaches 10 stacks they instead get Poisoned mind for 5.3 seconds.

Hunter Necrotic Eye super: Death’s Sight.
Casting this super will make a third eye that has two attacks.

Heavy:send a huge wave of Soulfire at any direction your looking at, this will give poisoned mind and kills with it will extend the super.

Spread corruption, one by one, to the body or mind, or even to their very life force.
Warlock: Lich 
Titan: Soul Breaker
Hunter: Necrotic Eye

Grenades: Life Tether grenade, Death Spike Grenade, Soul Pit grenade and Rotting Veil grenade.

Life Tether:

Death spike: on impact on the ground on send a wave of Soulfire forward, targets will get stacks of decayed.

Soul pit: throw on the ground to conjure a dimly lit green hive circle on the ground, if a opponent gets on they will be trapped and slowly take damage, if they die they will drop a Soulfire remnant, this will heal health and give energy to the smallest charged ability. 

Rotting Veil: makes an explosion that will give Poisoned mind, this will make combatants fight each other and players to have no control over their guardian, the player duration for this is shorter.  
 
Warlock Lich abilities: melee: Surging Rot and Necromancer’s Grasp 

Surging Rot: melee a target to give decay, they will be disorientated as well and take increased damage. If they die you will be healed. Shoot out a toxic spiked chain the will give decay, if they die you can bring a Soulfire version of them, they do increase damage but have little less health and will disappear after 10 seconds. 

Aspects: Shattered Hope, Nerkios’s Logic, Wizard’s Alchemy.

Shattered Hope:
A destroyed hive crystal. Unlike others, this one has pure hive magic within. Even in its current state, it’s power is still strong and can be used for your needs. When your at critical health, a burst of Soulfire surrounds you and gives decay to all surrounding opponents. Decay has stronger effects and makes more stacks.

Nokris’s logic:
A torn of piece of robe from Nerkios. The text on it isn’t complete but still can be read clearly for devastating afflictions. Killing enemies with decay will make a Soulfire tune in the corpse, going near and holding the active button will make a Soulfire version of the dead enemy. Soulfire enemies do more damage but are weaker.

295,Destiny,"Yes, the filtering feature on splitters is incredibly powerful. Yes, they basically invalidate the existence of filter inserters. That does not mean that splitter filters are unethical and you should play without them.

Firstly, this isn't a big deal in vanilla Factorio as there's only like 2 cases where you would be forced to deal with having multiple products on the same belt (Nuclear ore refinement and mining when deposits are located adjacent to each other). In all other cases if you're trying to filter items on a belt you should probably instead refactor things so the products are all staying on separate belts to begin with.

Secondly, when I admitted that splitters are much stronger than inserters, that is mainly because filter inserters are much weaker than they first appear. Consider the problem you want to solve with filter inserters that you would typically solve with a splitter: a belt is mostly one product, but a small amount of byproduct is taking up some of the belt (say, 33% of the belt, or 15 items per second on a blue belt). You may think that a filter inserter with stack size 2 and a rotation speed of 832° would be able to move (832° / 360° \* 2 products per rotation) \~4.62 products per second, so about 4 inserters to catch all the byproduct (already way more expensive in products and space than a splitter), and you'd be wrong. Filter rotation speed only applies when a filter is rotating, meaning it had products to pull grab, and a place to put the products, i.e. when it's pulling from a container to a container, or maybe a container to an empty, fast belt, which is very different from this problem of belt -&gt; belt transport. Any time the belt they're pulling from doesn't have the product it's looking for, the inserter is idle, any time the destination belt is full of other products, the belt will be idle, so they functionally have a reduced rotation speed as they wait for enough product to fill up their stack size and wait for space in their destination to place the product, and the actual rate of transport is very swingy and hard to plan around.

Then we have to consider the actual rate of byproduct on the mixed belt. We were assuming 33% of the belt is filled with byproduct, but there's no way that's going to be evenly distributed, and large factories deal with literally millions of products and dozens of production lines that have to run without issue or the player will quickly be spending all their playtime micromanaging and putting out fires instead of actually building their factory, so we have to plan around super unlucky 1% scenarios of like 50 byproducts all coming in one second, or else byproduct squeaking through our inserters will eventually backup the belt and ruin the whole production line (most production lines start to significantly break after only one or two incorrect inputs).

The initial estimate of about 4 inserters to replace 1 splitter quickly balloons to like 6 or 7, then again to like a dozen or more, and don't forget you need belt space on the input *and output* of all those inserters.

This would make filtering byproducts into far and away the most difficult and confusing problem in all of (vanilla) Factorio for a player to solve, and one they could potentially deal with in the first few hours of the game. Then it would become something that only occurs optionally in the super late game in a production problem that is already the current most-complex process in all of Factorio (so much so that it intimidated Destiny into staying away from it for literally hundreds of hours of vanilla Factorio and Space Exploration gameplay).

308,Destiny,"It has become the most common talking point among Tate's supporters, and even his own lawyer, to say that there is actually zero proof of any of the allegations made against the Tates. It has been widely known in Romania for a week now that this is simply not the case, since the prosecution has leaked a number of snippets from wiretapped transcripts they obtained during their investigation.

These transcripts were used, along with the victim statements, expert psychological reports of the victims and Andrew Tate's own words published to social media in public videos to convince the Judge that there is at least a reasonable suspicion that the defendants committed the crimes of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group, while the judge asked for more evidence of the rape accusation (it is notoriously difficult to prove rape, especially if said rape happened a long time ago).

One of the defence strategies Tate's lawyer used was to say that Tate was simply playing a character, or persona, in his videos so the videos shouldn't be used as evidence.

Conversation 1 (promise of marriage):

Emory (Andrew Tate): You have to understand that once you're mine, you'll be mine forever. A woman never leaves her man. I will be the last man in your life.

Emory: what do we do if we fall in love and I kidnap you to bring you to Bucharest?  
Girl: I don't think it's kidnapping, if I want to come.

Emory: first I have to see in your eyes that you will never be able to live without me. And then I can trust you to show you everything  
Girl: Bring a ring with you when you come 😊

Emory: Can you be loving enough to be a wife? To always be by my side, wherever I go? Talk to 0 men besides me? Ride or die? 😊

Emory: you have to move to Romania with me, to keep an eye on you.  
Emory: You're mine. Do not forget that. And act like it. We will be together soon.  
Girl: but can I trust you?  
Emory: Yes. You can.  
Emory: You will move to Romania with me. I plan when I get there. First, I might have to go to Prague for a few days.  
Emory: and we meet in Romania.

Emory: and I want to know that you are committed  
Emory: Serious about marriage.  
Girl: Yes. I am serious.

Conversation 3 (Andrew tells the victim not to leave the house without one of the 3 trusted employees (Tristan, and the 2 ""angels"" arrested) following and watching her, making a clear threat despite the victim pleading that she wants to leave the house alone:

The transcripts contain admissions of criminality, manipulation, violent threats and more corroborating victim testimony It has become the most common talking point among Tate's supporters, and even his own lawyer, to say that there is actually zero proof of any of the allegations made against the Tates. It has been widely known in Romania for a week now that this is simply not the case, since the prosecution has leaked a number of snippets from wiretapped transcripts they obtained during their investigation.

These transcripts were used, along with the victim statements, expert psychological reports of the victims and Andrew Tate's own words published to social media in public videos to convince the Judge that there is at least a reasonable suspicion that the defendants committed the crimes of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group, while the judge asked for more evidence of the rape accusation (it is notoriously difficult to prove rape, especially if said rape happened a long time ago).

One of the defence strategies Tate's lawyer used was to say that Tate was simply playing a character, or persona, in his videos so the videos shouldn't be used as evidence. However, the judge disagreed with this defence as the wiretapped transcripts obtained by prosecutors showed Tate with the same attitude and personality in private messages between himself and the victims and others.

&amp;#x200B;

Interview with Stefan Molyneux when describing what perfect peace is:

&amp;#x200B;

“It is no conflict within. You have no doubt, no fear, no worry, no second thoughts. your mind body and soul within is at peace. You no longer have peaks or valleys emotionally. And it doesn’t matter what happens in the world around you or what’s happening to you. It’s just a situation.  And because of that peace you can see it’s not happening to you. It’s just a situation you have to deal with. You don’t identify with the situation at all. No matter what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

There is a war happening between good and evil. And in our mind is an evil battle between the mind and the soul in our belly. Our real self. But if you realize that within yourself… but if you let that happen without identifying with it then the real you will emerge.

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

In that fallen state they can’t see. Because they’ve identified with that evil \[the mind/ego\]. They believe that it’s them. They don’t realize that there’s another identity that’s made a home in them. And it works in their mind and feeling. And they identify with the mind believing that their thoughts are their own. And so if you believe that your thoughts are your own you will be controlled by it. But when you start to realize that you are not your thoughts and you don’t create thoughts then the real you observe the not you and that’s when you can win the battle.”

&amp;#x200B;

From a random caller: 

&amp;#x200B;

""In real reality you don’t have any problem. It’s only in the illusion that you have problems. It’s just that you believed a thought and had a feeling about the thought and then call it a problem. But if you stopped believing in the imagination you’d never have a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

All thoughts except for practical thoughts are evil. The ones you think are good thoughts are not. because it just a set-up. It’ll tell you “Oh you a king. Or you a queen”. Only for you to be disappointed later. And all bad thoughts are a set up and is evil. So don't judge them, just watch them. And once you do that you will start to live your real life.""

About 30 mins ago someone asked Destiny if there was anything to make your beard softer, and his response was so silly that I had to post here. 

Don’t ask this sweatpants wearing, disheveled looking bitch about your hair. ESPECIALLY if his only advice on the subject is, “Well I guess you’ll just have to shave it off there’s NOTHING else you can do.” 

This take was arguably worse than any food take. I’m actually convinced now that Steven was using 3 in 1 shampoo/body/face bullshit before he dyed his hair. 

Beard OIL can be a bit much, might feel weird and will definitely leave some oily residue on whatever it touches, but, if you have a beard and you’re an adult you should 100% have: 
A face wash
Shampoo for hair
CONDITIONER for hair
Shampoo for your beard
And a CONDITIONER for your beard. 

There are hydrating conditioners, and balms for your beard that will make your beard softer. Yes, it will still be coarser than your hair on your head, but it will be soft enough for your girlfriend to not hate your beard.

Don’t ask this sweatpants wearing, disheveled looking bitch about your hair. ESPECIALLY if his only advice on the subject is, “Well I guess you’ll just have to shave it off there’s NOTHING else you can do.” 

This take was arguably worse than any food take. I’m actually convinced now that Steven was using 3 in 1 shampoo/body/face bullshit before he dyed his hair. 

Beard OIL can be a bit much, might feel weird and will definitely leave some oily residue on whatever it touches, but, if you have a beard and you’re an adult you should 100% have: 
A face wash
Shampoo for hair
CONDITIONER for hair
Shampoo for your beard
And a CONDITIONER for your beard. 

There are hydrating conditioners, and balms for your beard that will make your beard softer. Yes, it will still be coarser than your hair on your head, but it will be soft enough for your girlfriend to not hate your beard. 

And, I’m just assuming things at this point, but just in case I’ll say this too:
Brush and trim your beard too, you fuck. 

Love you bye"

334,Destiny,"If you follow Israeli politics, the new far-right government probably worries you, just like me. The Israeli democracy is on shaky grounds right now. But I don´t think the Israeli population is entirely to blame.

What bothers me is the western lefts attitude towards Israeli issues. Public opinion towards Israel shifted from positive to negative after the '67 war. While there were things that Israel wasn´t handling very well, Arab and Palestinian governments completely blocked all normalization of the situation. But still, Israel is seen by leftist as the main perpetrator.

Israel has a major trauma when it comes to caving in to international demands. In particular there are two events in history that is ingrained in Israeli identity. 

The first is the Yom Kippur War in '73. After the '67 war meantioned above the world community denounced the attack of Israel, even though Israel had substantial cause to invade because Israels safety was at stake. Just as in '67, in '73 the Israeli inteligence had evidence for a upcoming invasion. But this time Israel was discourged by the US to do a preemtive strike again.

This lead to the Yom Kippur war, where Israel was pretty near to annihilation. Every time someone meations Israel as this great empireal power, I remember that it is not self-evident that Israel exists today.

The second event was the unilateral retreat from Gaza. Israel withdrawing from Gaza was the nearest thing to the end of the Israeli occupation of Palestine. I believe that it was like a test run for the whole withdraw from the west bank. But this blew up in Israels face. Instead of a peaceful neighbor they got Hamas.

From this point on it was really hard as an Israeli leftists to campaign for compromise. As a Israeli leftist you stand alone: The Israeli right-wing calls you unrealistic, the western left sides with Palestinians.

How do you expect a left government to form if you don´t have any allies?

I want to add that I am in no way downplaying the harm of the new Israeli government. All I am saying is that up untill this point the Palestinian Authority and the Arab governments were the biggest obstacle to peace and the western left failed (or didn´t want) to see it.

345,Destiny,"As an ML researcher, I love the broader discussion that machine learning models like GPTChat and DALL-E receive. My hope in this post is to clear up some incorrect talking points that I often see in pop-sci discussions that people have about ML. So here we go!

##Misconception: We have no idea how deep learning models work!
Incorrect! For most models we have pretty good understanding and theories on how they work. What people mean to say is that their parameters are not very interpretable.

When we look at different neural architectures, such as fully connected networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers and so on, we have a really good understanding of what these models are capable of, what sorts of things the networks are capable of learning, and a general understanding of “how is any of this possible?!”

What people mean to say is that individual parameters of the network are not very interpretable. I learn nothing by opening up the text file of GPT-3’s  175 billion parameter. I can understand how it works, and I can perform experiments to try to understand what specific layers/attention heads tend to do, but I will not be able to tell you what any individual parameter of the network is doing. I especially won’t be able to tell you what the implications are between parameters across layers. This is often misrepresented as “we have no idea how deep learning works!” Not true.

##Misconception: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) learn just like we do!

Incorrect! Pretty much everything about how a neural network learns is different than how we learn.

The general way an ANN learns is you give it a batch of random training examples, and you look at how wrong the ANNs results are. You then use some calculus to adjust the ANNs parameters so that it produces better answers next time. 

Alternatively, we have no idea how a human brain learns. We know it’s not the backprop algorithm that ANNs use[1]. We have some notion that an important learning task for brains is “what happens next?”[2] - but we don’t understand the specific mechanisms or the specific Hebbian learning rules at play.

On top of that, an incredibly important difference is that a biological network are (almost) always given temporally correlated input. Input at time T is shortly followed by input at time T+1. This leads to an important ordering of biological network’s “training data” that probably has some pretty significant consequences. 

##Misconception: ANNs learn the same sorts of things we do!

Incorrect! Mostly…

There are some things where this statement is actually true! Importantly, the cortical vision structure of human brains seem to do similar things that specific layers/kernels do in a CNN[3]. It also seems like there are some analogous activations between the neurons in the hippocampus and attention between tokens in a Transformer[4].

  However, it also appears that brains have structure that specifically makes it easy for them to learn symbolic relationships. Alternatively, ANNs don’t have an inductive bias that allows them to easily capture symbolic relationships.

The result is that a child can learn grammatical structures with very few training examples [5.], where as a neural network needs billions of training examples to learn the same symbolic relationships. 

The sort of statistical representation that large language models (LLMs) build trying to capture symbolic relationships are shockingly powerful, but also have severe limitations, especially around the distributional tails of language [6].

A person can learn a new language with a few well written text books - even when that language is distant from their native tongue. However, LLMs seem to have a lot of difficulty producing similar quality of text /translation when the new language is far from their training set [6/7].

The expectation of the field is that this problem doesn’t improve by just making LLMs bigger. It seems like we need a specific sort of inductive bias to be able to learn symbolic systems efficiently.

##Misconception: Artificial neurons are pretty similar to biological neurons!

Incorrect! Artificial neurons are dumb. Real dumb. I’d go so far as to call them remedial. The way they work is by taking a weighted sum of their inputs and adding a bias. Mathematically speaking, they can only learn affine functions. An artificial neuron is able to learn “The mean of A and B”,  but it is impossible for them to learn “A or B, but not A and B”.

Alternatively, biological neurons are incredibly smart. They are amazingly adept at learning important relationships between their synapses (and typically biological neurons have more synapses [connections] than their artificial analogues), and they also don’t have the same sort of mathematical limitations that artificial neurons do.

A biological neuron is more analogous to an entire ANN than an individual artificial neuron - and its actually a surprisingly difficult task to use ML models to learn the various functions of individual neurons [8].


##Misconception: ANNs are pretty similar to biological neural networks!

Incorrect! There are many hugely significant differences, the most important of which (in my opinion) is that ANNs optimize for signal (A mistake for an ANN neuron is outputting 0.7 when it should have out put 0.72), whereas biological networks optimize for time (A mistake for a biological neuron is spiking at time T instead time T+0.03 s).

This is a huuuuuuge difference. Spiking neural networks (which optimize in the time space) are a huge mystery to us - and while we have had some forward progress in toy examples [9] we haven’t had a lot. This seems really important, and possibly important for symbolic thinking and deep thought in general.

I can think, and think, and think, and then I can think some more. On the other hand, an ANN can pass its input through N layers, and then is done. There is some research on using continuous processing in ANNs - however, it’s unclear that we will reach biological level results of continuous processing without using spiking networks - and there are so many problems that make researching artificial spiking networks a huge pain.

399,Destiny,"The other day I was reading a short essay by George Orwell called Pacifism and the War (published in *Partisan Review*. — GB, London. — August-September 1942), I found it to be very relevant to the topic of the Ukraine War. Even if both conflicts are not comparable in scale, and Russia is hardly the Nazis, I think Orwell's observations are uncannily similar to the situation happening today in Europe and the US.

I'm not very familiar with these guys Destiny is set to debate today, but he shouldn't let them get away with feigning pacifism in a way to support Russia. Just as Orwell mentions how one of the three men whom he argues with condemns every war measure taken by the Allies, but fails to mention Nazi aggression or its invasion of the Soviet Union a single time, I expect these Fascist shills to denounce all violence enacted by the Ukrainian state while failing to mention any violence enacted by the Russian state.

This co-opting of pacifism by violent ideologies to denounce the Liberal Democracies that intervene on behalf of nations being invaded and defaced by the states these ideologies wield as hammers of war is a century old.

To end my rambles I feel Orwell is almost talking to the modern audience in the two last sentences of his essay, and I will share them:

*""... That is on par\* with ‘peace’ propaganda which has to avoid mention of Hitler’s invasion of Russia\*, and it is not what I mean by intellectual honesty. It is just because I do take the function of the intelligentsia seriously that I don’t like the sneers, libels, parrot phrased and financially profitable back-scratching which flourish in our English literary world, and perhaps in yours also.""*

PS: The \* indicates I corrected grammatical mistakes made by the person who transcribed the essay to the internet seemingly in a hurry.

PSS: Orwell's essay is really short, even if you don't read the post you should read the essay.

PSSS: Reddit wouldn't allow me to post the link so I posted the essay below as a spoiler.

&amp;#x200B;

Essay:

&gt;!About a year ago I and a number of others were engaged in broadcasting literary programmes to India, and among other things we broadcast a good deal of verse by contemporary and near-contemporary English writers — for example, Eliot, Herbert Read, Auden, Spender, Dylan Thomas, Henry Treece, Alex Comfort, Robert Bridges, Edmund Blunden, D. H. Lawrence. Whenever it was possible we had poems broadcast by the people who wrote them. Just why these particular programmes (a small and remote out-flanking movement in the radio war) were instituted there is no need to explain here, but I should add that the fact that we were broadcasting to an Indian audience dictated our technique to some extent. The essential point was that our literary broadcasts were aimed at the Indian university students, a small and hostile audience, unapproachable by anything that could be described as British propaganda. It was known in advance that we could not hope for more than a few thousand listeners at the most, and this gave us an excuse to be more ‘highbrow’ than is generally possible on the air.!&lt;

&gt;!Since I don’t suppose you want to fill an entire number of P.R. (Partisan Review) with squalid controversies imported from across the Atlantic, I will lump together the various letters you have sent on to me (from Messrs Savage, Woodcock and Comfort), as the central issue in all of them is the same. But I must afterwards deal separately with some points of fact raised in various of the letters.!&lt;

&gt;!Pacifism. Pacifism is objectively pro-Fascist. This is elementary common sense. If you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, ‘he that is not with me is against me’. The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle, while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you, is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security. Mr Savage remarks that ‘according to this type of reasoning, a German or Japanese pacifist would be “objectively pro-British”.’ But of course he would be! That is why pacifist activities are not permitted in those countries (in both of them the penalty is, or can be, beheading) while both the Germans and the Japanese do all they can to encourage the spread of pacifism in British and American territories. The Germans even run a spurious ‘freedom’ station which serves out pacifist propaganda indistinguishable from that of the P.P.U. They would stimulate pacifism in Russia as well if they could, but in that case they have tougher babies to deal with. In so far as it takes effect at all, pacifist propaganda can only be effective against those countries where a certain amount of freedom of speech is still permitted; in other words it is helpful to totalitarianism.!&lt;

&gt;!I am not interested in pacifism as a ‘moral phenomenon’. If Mr Savage and others imagine that one can somehow ‘overcome’ the German army by lying on one’s back, let them go on imagining it, but let them also wonder occasionally whether this is not an illusion due to security, too much money and a simple ignorance of the way in which things actually happen. As an ex-Indian civil servant, it always makes me shout with laughter to hear, for instance, Gandhi named as an example of the success of non-violence. As long as twenty years ago it was cynically admitted in Anglo-Indian circles that Gandhi was very useful to the British government. So he will be to the Japanese if they get there. Despotic governments can stand ‘moral force’ till the cows come home; what they fear is physical force. But though not much interested in the ‘theory’ of pacifism, I am interested in the psychological processes by which pacifists who have started out with an alleged horror of violence end up with a marked tendency to be fascinated by the success and power of Nazism. Even pacifists who wouldn’t own to any such fascination are beginning to claim that a Nazi victory is desirable in itself. In the letter you sent on to me, Mr Comfort considers that an artist in occupied territory ought to ‘protest against such evils as he sees’, but considers that this is best done by ‘temporarily accepting the status quo’ (like Déat or Bergery, for instance?). a few weeks back he was hoping for a Nazi victory because of the stimulating effect it would have upon the arts:!&lt;

&gt;!As far as I can see, no therapy short of complete military defeat has any chance of re-establishing the common stability of literature and of the man in the street. One can imagine the greater the adversity the greater the sudden realization of a stream of imaginative work, and the greater the sudden katharsis of poetry, from the isolated interpretation of war as calamity to the realization of the imaginative and actual tragedy of Man. When we have access again to the literature of the war years in France, Poland and Czechoslovakia, I am confident that that is what we shall fined. (From a letter to Horizon.)!&lt;

&gt;!I pass over the money-sheltered ignorance capable of believing that literary life is still going on in, for instance, Poland, and remark merely that statements like this justify me in saying that our English pacifists are tending towards active pro-Fascism. But I don’t particularly object to that. What I object to is the intellectual cowardice of people who are objectively and to some extent emotionally pro-Fascist, but who don’t care to say so and take refuge behind the formula ‘I am just as anti-fascist as anyone, but—’. The result of this is that so-called peace propaganda is just as dishonest and intellectually disgusting as war propaganda. Like war propaganda, it concentrates on putting forward a ‘case’, obscuring the opponent’s point of view and avoiding awkward questions. The line normally followed is ‘Those who fight against Fascism go Fascist themselves.’ In order to evade the quite obvious objections that can be raised to this, the following propaganda-tricks are used:!&lt;

1. &gt;!The Fascizing processes occurring in Britain as a result of war are systematically exaggerated.!&lt;
2. &gt;!The actual record of Fascism, especially its pre-war history, is ignored or pooh-poohed as ‘propaganda’. Discussion of what the world would actually be like if the Axis dominated it is evaded.!&lt;
3. &gt;!Those who want to struggle against Fascism are accused of being wholehearted defenders of capitalist ‘democracy’. The fact that the rich everywhere tend to be pro-Fascist and the working class are nearly always anti-Fascist is hushed up.!&lt;

With regard to (a), it is quite true that I served five years in the Indian Police. It is also true that I gave up that job, partly because it didn’t suit me but mainly because I would not any longer be a servant of imperialism. I am against imperialism because I know something about it from the inside. The whole history of this is to be found in my writings, including a novel (Burmese Days) which I think I can claim was a kind of prophecy of what happened this year in Burma. (b) Of course I have written for the Adelphi. Why not? I once wrote an article for a vegetarian paper. Does that make me a vegetarian? I was associated with the Trotskyists in Spain. It was chance that I was serving in the P.O.U.M. militia and not another, and I largely disagreed with the P.O.U. M. ‘line’ and told its leaders so freely, but when they were afterwards accused of pro-Fascist activities I defended them as best it could. How does this contradict my present anti-Hitler attitude? It is news to me that Trotskyists are either pacifists or pro-Fascists. (c) Does Mr Woodcock really know what kind of stuff I put out in the Indian broadcasts? He does not — though I would be quite glad to tell him about it. He is careful not to mention what other people are associated with these Indian broadcasts. One for instance is Herbert Read, whom he mentions with approval. Others are T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, Reginald Reynolds, Stephen Spender, J. B. S. Haldane, Tom Wintringham. Most of our broadcasters are Indian left-wing intellectual, from Liberals to Trotskyists, some of them bitterly anti-British. They don’t do it to ‘fox the Indian masses’ but because they know what a Fascist victory would mean to the chances of India’s independence. Why not try to find out what I am doing before accusing my good faith?!&lt;

&gt;!‘Mr Orwell is intellectual-hunting again’ (Mr Comfort). I have never attacked ‘the intellectuals’ or ‘the intelligentsia’ en bloc. I have used a lot of ink and done myself a lot of harm by attacking the successive literary cliques which have infested this country, not because they were intellectuals but precisely because they were not what I mean by true intellectuals. The life of a clique is about five years and I have been writing long enough to see three of them come and two go — the Catholic gang, the Stalinist gang, and the present pacifist or, as they are sometimes nicknamed, Fascifist gang. My case against all of them is that they write mentally dishonest propaganda and degrade literary criticism to mutual arse-licking. But even with these various schools I would differentiate between individuals. I would never think of coupling Christopher Dawson with Arnold Lunn, or Malraux with Palme Dutt, or Max Plowman with the Duke of Bedford. And even the work of one individual can exist at very different levels. For instance Mr Comfort himself wrote one poem I value greatly (‘The Atoll in the Mind’), and I wish he would write more of them instead of lifeless propaganda tracts dressed up as novels. But his letter he has chosen to send you is a different matter. Instead of answering what I have said he tries to prejudice an audience to whom I am little known by a misrepresentation of my general line and sneers about my ‘status’ in England. (A writer isn’t judged by his ‘status’, he is judged by his work.) That is on a par with ‘peace’ propaganda which has to avoid mention of Hitler’s invasion of Russian, and it is not what I mean by intellectual honesty. It is just because I do take the function of the intelligentsia seriously that I don’t like the sneers, libels, parrot phrased and financially profitable back-scratching which flourish in our English literary world, and perhaps in yours also.!&lt;

&gt;! !&lt;",Pacifism and the War. Relevant for today's debate (Schizo-Pseudo-Effort Post),1673371397,"Pacifism and the War. Relevant for today's debate (Schizo-Pseudo-Effort Post) The other day I was reading a short essay by George Orwell called Pacifism and the War (published in *Partisan Review*. — GB, London. — August-September 1942), I found it to be very relevant to the topic of the Ukraine War. Even if both conflicts are not comparable in scale, and Russia is hardly the Nazis, I think Orwell's observations are uncannily similar to the situation happening today in Europe and the US.

I'm not very familiar with these guys Destiny is set to debate today, but he shouldn't let them get away with feigning pacifism in a way to support Russia. Just as Orwell mentions how one of the three men whom he argues with condemns every war measure taken by the Allies, but fails to mention Nazi aggression or its invasion of the Soviet Union a single time, I expect these Fascist shills to denounce all violence enacted by the Ukrainian state while failing to mention any violence enacted by the Russian state.

This co-opting of pacifism by violent ideologies to denounce the Liberal Democracies that intervene on behalf of nations being invaded and defaced by the states these ideologies wield as hammers of war is a century old.

To end my rambles I feel Orwell is almost talking to the modern audience in the two last sentences of his essay, and I will share them:

*""... That is on par\* with ‘peace’ propaganda which has to avoid mention of Hitler’s invasion of Russia\*, and it is not what I mean by intellectual honesty. It is just because I do take the function of the intelligentsia seriously that I don’t like the sneers, libels, parrot phrased and financially profitable back-scratching which flourish in our English literary world, and perhaps in yours also.""*

PS: The \* indicates I corrected grammatical mistakes made by the person who transcribed the essay to the internet seemingly in a hurry.

PSS: Orwell's essay is really short, even if you don't read the post you should read the essay.

PSSS: Reddit wouldn't allow me to post the link so I posted the essay below as a spoiler.

&amp;#x200B;

Essay:

&gt;!About a year ago I and a number of others were engaged in broadcasting literary programmes to India, and among other things we broadcast a good deal of verse by contemporary and near-contemporary English writers — for example, Eliot, Herbert Read, Auden, Spender, Dylan Thomas, Henry Treece, Alex Comfort, Robert Bridges, Edmund Blunden, D. H. Lawrence. Whenever it was possible we had poems broadcast by the people who wrote them. Just why these particular programmes (a small and remote out-flanking movement in the radio war) were instituted there is no need to explain here, but I should add that the fact that we were broadcasting to an Indian audience dictated our technique to some extent. The essential point was that our literary broadcasts were aimed at the Indian university students, a small and hostile audience, unapproachable by anything that could be described as British propaganda. It was known in advance that we could not hope for more than a few thousand listeners at the most, and this gave us an excuse to be more ‘highbrow’ than is generally possible on the air.!&lt;

&gt;!Since I don’t suppose you want to fill an entire number of P.R. (Partisan Review) with squalid controversies imported from across the Atlantic, I will lump together the various letters you have sent on to me (from Messrs Savage, Woodcock and Comfort), as the central issue in all of them is the same. But I must afterwards deal separately with some points of fact raised in various of the letters.!&lt;

&gt;!Pacifism. Pacifism is objectively pro-Fascist. This is elementary common sense. If you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, ‘he that is not with me is against me’. The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle, while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you, is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security. Mr Savage remarks that ‘according to this type of reasoning, a German or Japanese pacifist would be “objectively pro-British”.’ But of course he would be! That is why pacifist activities are not permitted in those countries (in both of them the penalty is, or can be, beheading) while both the Germans and the Japanese do all they can to encourage the spread of pacifism in British and American territories. The Germans even run a spurious ‘freedom’ station which serves out pacifist propaganda indistinguishable from that of the P.P.U. They would stimulate pacifism in Russia as well if they could, but in that case they have tougher babies to deal with. In so far as it takes effect at all, pacifist propaganda can only be effective against those countries where a certain amount of freedom of speech is still permitted; in other words it is helpful to totalitarianism.!&lt;

&gt;!I am not interested in pacifism as a ‘moral phenomenon’. If Mr Savage and others imagine that one can somehow ‘overcome’ the German army by lying on one’s back, let them go on imagining it, but let them also wonder occasionally whether this is not an illusion due to security, too much money and a simple ignorance of the way in which things actually happen. As an ex-Indian civil servant, it always makes me shout with laughter to hear, for instance, Gandhi named as an example of the success of non-violence. As long as twenty years ago it was cynically admitted in Anglo-Indian circles that Gandhi was very useful to the British government. So he will be to the Japanese if they get there. Despotic governments can stand ‘moral force’ till the cows come home; what they fear is physical force. But though not much interested in the ‘theory’ of pacifism, I am interested in the psychological processes by which pacifists who have started out with an alleged horror of violence end up with a marked tendency to be fascinated by the success and power of Nazism. Even pacifists who wouldn’t own to any such fascination are beginning to claim that a Nazi victory is desirable in itself. In the letter you sent on to me, Mr Comfort considers that an artist in occupied territory ought to ‘protest against such evils as he sees’, but considers that this is best done by ‘temporarily accepting the status quo’ (like Déat or Bergery, for instance?). a few weeks back he was hoping for a Nazi victory because of the stimulating effect it would have upon the arts:!&lt;

&gt;!As far as I can see, no therapy short of complete military defeat has any chance of re-establishing the common stability of literature and of the man in the street. One can imagine the greater the adversity the greater the sudden realization of a stream of imaginative work, and the greater the sudden katharsis of poetry, from the isolated interpretation of war as calamity to the realization of the imaginative and actual tragedy of Man. When we have access again to the literature of the war years in France, Poland and Czechoslovakia, I am confident that that is what we shall fined. (From a letter to Horizon.)!&lt;

&gt;!I pass over the money-sheltered ignorance capable of believing that literary life is still going on in, for instance, Poland, and remark merely that statements like this justify me in saying that our English pacifists are tending towards active pro-Fascism. But I don’t particularly object to that. What I object to is the intellectual cowardice of people who are objectively and to some extent emotionally pro-Fascist, but who don’t care to say so and take refuge behind the formula ‘I am just as anti-fascist as anyone, but—’. The result of this is that so-called peace propaganda is just as dishonest and intellectually disgusting as war propaganda. Like war propaganda, it concentrates on putting forward a ‘case’, obscuring the opponent’s point of view and avoiding awkward questions. The line normally followed is ‘Those who fight against Fascism go Fascist themselves.’ In order to evade the quite obvious objections that can be raised to this, the following propaganda-tricks are used:!&lt;

1. &gt;!The Fascizing processes occurring in Britain as a result of war are systematically exaggerated.!&lt;
2. &gt;!The actual record of Fascism, especially its pre-war history, is ignored or pooh-poohed as ‘propaganda’. Discussion of what the world would actually be like if the Axis dominated it is evaded.!&lt;
3. &gt;!Those who want to struggle against Fascism are accused of being wholehearted defenders of capitalist ‘democracy’. The fact that the rich everywhere tend to be pro-Fascist and the working class are nearly always anti-Fascist is hushed up.!&lt;
4. &gt;!It is tacitly pretended that the war is only between Britain and Germany. Mention of Russia and China, and their fate if Fascism is permitted to win, is avoided. (You won’t find one word about Russia or China in the three letters you sent to me.)!&lt;

&gt;!Now as to one or two points of fact which I must deal with if your correspondents’ letters are to be printed in full.!&lt;

&gt;!My past and present. Mr Woodcock tries to discredit me by saying that (a) I once served in the Indian Imperial Police, (b) I have written article for the Adelphi and was mixed up with the Trotskyists in Spain, and (c) that I am at the B.B.C. ‘conducting British propaganda to fox the Indian masses’. With regard to (a), it is quite true that I served five years in the Indian Police. It is also true that I gave up that job, partly because it didn’t suit me but mainly because I would not any longer be a servant of imperialism. I am against imperialism because I know something about it from the inside. The whole history of this is to be found in my writings, including a novel (Burmese Days) which I think I can claim was a kind of prophecy of what happened this year in Burma. (b) Of course I have written for the Adelphi. Why not? I once wrote an article for a vegetarian paper. Does that make me a vegetarian? I was associated with the Trotskyists in Spain.

402,Destiny,"TLDR: ""Dark Seijin"" egging Darius on and chatting with his girl makes him a way more interesting character. After the lame Destiny PR discussions, Seijin as a villain takes a small W in my book. Darius came across as completely unhinged. Seijin being smug while possibly being slightly evil is just a much better look for him. Darius also vague posted significantly more than Seijin in the convo going as far as to call Sushia ""an abuser"" repeatedly. 

As most of you are aware, last night a dramatic call took place featuring Darius, Seijin, Supreme, Sushia and Ragepope (the second best orbiter after exskillsme rest his soul). So far this call has been characterized as a Seijin and Sushia L with Darius looking like a victim (if an unsympathetic one). A brief summary of the drama is as follows. Darius and Sushia had what could be characterized as an unpleasant breakup. Issues in their relationship that have been alluded to include Darius's alleged financial troubles and miss-management, Sushia possibly talking about personal issues that Darius is alleged to have had, Sushia likely sending explicit content to people she talks to including Seijin. 

Seijin is someone who Sushia is confirmed to have talked to at some length about something. Disagreement exists about the nature of these conversations. Darius accused Sushia of saying things about him that would have Seijin given a negative opinion about him. Sushia states that these conversations were about her problems and that Darius was not the primary topic of interest going as far to say that Darius was only mentioned in ""three sentences."" It is partially confirmed that Seijin helped Sushia with her only fans by transferring 7000 explicit photos. 

In the call, Darius described Seijin as a ""simp"" who was was sexual and/or romantically interested in Sushia. He accused Seijin of uncritically believing everything Sushia is purported to have said going as far to have called him a ""sex pest."" He also stated that he only lost $600 in the stock market. This was in response to Seijin vague posting the insult ""I just don't like when people drag other people down"" about Darius's financial mistakes. As an aside, I do not have complete access to Seijin chat logs. 

Seijin argued that Darius's general financial situation was generally already public knowledge and that he has always had a negative opinion of Darius which would indicate that his opinion was possibly only reinforced by Sushia's opinion. 

During the call, Ragepope was involved by egging both parties on. Some of the more inflammatory remarks include a comment asking ""if Seijin had ever masturbated to Sushia,"" and saying that ""if you stand under the hoop long enough..."" insinuating that Seijin was attempting to steal Darius's girl. 

Now as a few quick points to make. Steven's point that you shouldn't talk shit to lots of people about your partner is generally true. However, we don't know for sure the topics of conversation between Seijin and Darius. Darius says a lot on stream that Seijin could use to develop an opinion of him. We also don't know the timeline of when certain conversations were had. Having a conversations when you are together with someone as opposed to when you are there ex is different. 

That being said, Seijin was vague posting, which is an L in this community. However, Darius's reaction towards Sushia in the call put him in the worst light possible e.g. telling her to shut up while characterizing Seijin and Sushia's relationship in perhaps an unnecessarily negative light. While we can accuse Seijin of vague posting, Darius ""vague talked"" a lot on stream and thus without further details, we should rely more on Darius acting unhinged on the call. Sushia should be in the call when she is spoken negatively about. Darius also trauma dumped throughout the call. He wasn't saying ""someone died in his arms,"" but he did insinuate that Sushia fucked him mentally, gaslit him for a year, and was an abuser. He did more than equal Seijin in the vague posting. 

I personally, love watching people's lives just get ground to dust. Ragepope antagonizing both sides is a true modern classic. Darius came in style (as usual) and I hope to see him go through more messy breakups in the future...  I'm really enjoying the new ""dark Seijin.""

Darius thought it would be funny to act like he actually was mad, and push both Destiny and Seijen to tell him (live) what was said.  
After a while, Darius gets angry at Seijen.

Seijen lets Darius know they were talking about him.  
Darius gets even angrier.

So why was Darius so angry? Was it really because of his ex/gf (I'm not sure) revealed something personal? Is that really a good reason to actually fight publicly over it?   
What did Seijin do that he shouldn't? Are people really just angry at him because he got baited by the stupid act Darius always plays? Is Darius involved in the financial situation Sushia is in? Why does he get to act disrespectful to people but when Seijin acts the same way he becomes the villain?

I Might have overlooked something or missed it while listening, but I don't get how anybody could think Seijen is the bad guy. At worst, you could think it is Sushia, but probably Darius.

From what I got is that yesterday Destiny, Sushia and Seijen were in a call.   
Somebody was trying to bait Darius in to getting mad.  
Darius thought it would be funny to act like he actually was mad, and push both Destiny and Seijen to tell him (live) what was said.  
After a while, Darius gets angry at Seijen.  
Ragepope joins  
Seijen lets Darius know they were talking about him.  
Darius gets even angrier.

408,Destiny,"Iirc, it's that when complaining you will always show an unfavorable bias about your partner. It could be as little as he doesn't hug me in the morning where is a slight grievance on your side, but your friend sees it as much worst that it really is because you either used harsh language or because of your bias explaining it or the friend could have a bias against yiur partner. You should have one friend that you tell stuff to rather than a group (I remember him saying something like a year or so ago its better if it's a mutual friend between both partners. I think he said this before but don't have the clip).

&gt;!My smoldering hot take is ofc Destiny is correct. This is true for men and women complaining, but I've known more women in my life and see them doing this more. It's okay to complain. I just hate seeing people not realise what they're saying or how their description looks. Talk to some me but re read over what you wrote in like a day or 3. If a friend to ranting to you, then you should ask yourself or them if they just need an ear or help with something. Always assume they need an ear and never invest much into their drama. You'll be fucked by the end of it. You'll be seen as that biased bad guy friend when they work stuff out. Also this should go without saying; never ever fucking seriously ever discuss stuff told to you on private with a friend. They will fuck you because you fucked yourself.

410,Destiny,"Art - An expression of the creative process (intentionally or unintentionally) viewed subjectively through the experience of one or more observers. 

I added the intention part because it was one of the main ideas discussed on the stream. However, I believe it's irrelevant and I believe all those involved last night would believe that as well, given the right example. So let's test this definition. 

My 10 year old nephew creates a painting and gives it to me. I view it as art, therefore it is. My nephew could also NOT view it as art and it still would be. (filtered through my subjective experience)

The photocopier was also used as an example of something not creating art. But I can envision at least two cases in which it could be. If I photocopy my ass, as one is want to do, and sign it, and I view it as art, it is. Maybe others do as well, but that's not a requirement. 

If the photocopier is bleeding toner, maybe the photocopy it creates is much different and creates an artistic flair. It would depend on the subjective of those who viewed it. 

Let's do an unintentional example. We've all seen those waffles or pancakes that have Jesus or Mother Theresea on them. Many people view those as art. It's just happenstance that those features arise from the heat coils of a toaster. And while it would be a form of pareidolia, the fact that people go further and celebrate and subjectively view these pieces as art. 

Here's one more example that kind of blew my mind. I don't know if most people know this or not, but part of the popularity of the Mona Lisa was that it was stolen in the early 1900s. Retrieving it increased it's cultural and financial value. So you could \*actually\* argue that the heist to take the Mona Lisa was actually not only art itself, but almost like touching up the Mona Lisa and restoring it. Super weird, but interesting. 

I feel like a lot of the conversation revolved around the magnitude of social, cultural, and financial importance as it relates to what art is. But to be fair, that's not really important in classifying art, only I guess in classifying GOOD art. And even then, it's all subjective. I think consensus could maybe get us somewhere, but never even close to objectivity. While a picture painted by my nephew might have very little social, cultural, or financial significance to society. But it may have a lot of value to me personally.

Kai is 100% legally responsible for what happened to the girl. However this responsibility is only under civil/tort law and he will end up getting sued in court and he will lose.

A home owner, or someone renting and inviting people over, you are legally responsible for almost everything that happened under that roof, and can be reasonable to prevent.

If the home owner/ renter, tells you that it is safe to stay over, that is even worse... because now the implied expectation that the house is safe, now becomes an explicit expectation from the person staying over.

He was very negligent in setting up an environment where his guests would be protected, his security was just for show or the instructions that were given to them and that Kai signed off were insufficient in order to prevent the rape, this is negligence in the eyes of the law.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it doesn't matter if it was Kai or Kai team that did not provided the information that was requested on a timely manner.

**If you don't provide the name of the guy as soon as you recognize him, you are doing it to either protect your friend, or protect yourself. You are not doing it because you are on her side. You cant have it both ways, because you and her are adversaries in the legal sense.**

Kai is trying to save his ass by claiming that he cared, but that his lawyers did not let him release this information. This is total bullshit and you know it. Your lawyers gives you an advise, and you decide or not to take it. They don't hold your mouth. It was in Kai's best legal interest to stop talking to the girl, because the girl has a lawsuit against him coming. But you cant on the same breath claim that kai has the best interest of the girl at heart.

Imagine how it will play out in court. Just ask the simple question... if you recognize the person in the photo.. why didn't you provide the name right away? The only possible answer is to protect himself or his friend. If you are protecting your friend... that is now  a cover up, which is pretty bad, not illegal though, because she is not the police, but in the court of public opinion those are cancellable offenses.

426,Destiny,"Title... All of chat soys out because they think they are logical and objective and artists are dumb and AI art is gigachad because it puts artists out of work or whatever, it's cringe as fuck. 

There's a few things to say here before responding to the arguments made on stream last night, of which I only caught some of. For what it's worth, I went to school for a fine art undergrad.

1. Online freelance artists are ALMOST always fucking cringelords. Nobody really cares how long it takes to create a piece of art, drawing, sculpture, etc. People always tout this as something that makes their work special or unique, literally no potential customer cares, no layperson cares, it's purely self fellatio and genuinely makes all artists look like self entitled losers. 

2. Illustration/graphic design is more akin to a craft than an art. This may be triggering to a lot of freelancers to hear but it's true. Someone that creates emotes, commission work for one off pieces, logos, animated intros for videos, etc. Are working in a more similar manner  to a craftsman creating furniture or a production glassmaker  for a client than they are to a fine artist making work for a series or gallery. To be clear, there is nothing wrong or bad about this but the distinction is pretty important in the context of this conversation.

With that being said here are my thoughts on AI art as it currently stands.

AI is another tool to be used to create amazing work, the same way a camera, or a computer, a Wacom tablet, or a drone with a video camera attached can be used to create amazing work, of course its all about the execution, this will evolve over time, this debate around the medium has happened with every single new emerging medium in art history, it's nothing new and will figure itself out over time, it will be extremely interesting to watch though.

People comparing this to automation are right, it is like automation but the arguments I've heard to capture this as well as I think they could. The conversation shouldn't be about automation per se but around commoditization. The new technology makes custom art more accessible to the general public for sure, this is probably a good thing, as much as it triggers freelancers, having the public engage more with an artistic medium is good, having more people have access to tools to create art is good. **BUT** this is more along the lines of comparing Ikea furniture to furniture made by a master craftsman, yes everyone can now access it but there is a level of skill, talent, understanding of medium and concepts, history, and respect that AI can never put into a piece of art, I think completely writing off these human elements is childish and doesn't serve the conversation at all, these things are so deeply engrained in art and realistically go hand in hand, you almost can't separate them. 

AI art can never fully grasp conceptual work. This topic briefly came up last night and everyone was very understandably out of their element. Conceptual work is made for a very specific audience, an audience that is specifically seeking the deeper meaning behind a piece of series of work, they are looking for what is *not shown* more than what *is shown*. This doesn't mean it's better or worse than aesthetic art, it's just different, it's usually exploratory in nature, sometimes avant garde, and sometimes shocking for the sake of being shocking. This is personally my favorite kind of art, it requires deeper understanding of the artists intention, choices, and the history and context of a piece of work, this is fun for me. Performance art is a great example of something AI art could never recreate, the medium itself is something that changes with each show, it could script a piece I suppose but the actual art is the performance, the audience perception, reception, and reaction. This is why I say it moves more toward automation of a craft than of *art*.

Contemporary art is very shaped by art history, similar to how popular music changes and borrows from music history over time, concepts, mediums, themes, and techniques in fine art do the same. AI can't currently assess these deeper understandings of fine art that humans can, and contextualize art in the way that we do. Sure you could prompt it to create a modern surrealist work and it would spit out something really interesting but there's no *why* there. The AI doesn't have an influence in the way a human artist does. Artists work is shaped by life struggles, was, their environment, other makers in and out of their field of work, their parents, current events, different forms of media, and a multitude of other factors. Artistic movements exist around specific historical events for the most part. DaDa around WW1, surrealism and the work of Freud, pop art and the hyper consumer culture of America in the 50s and 60s, etc. Some movements even develop from other movements like minimalism deriving from cubism and abstract expressionism. As it currently stands, I don't think AI can fully grasp these things, so the art it creates is much more surface level in these regards. 

At the end of the day, as much as it triggers the AI jerkers, this technology will make freelancers more money most likely, there will always be an audience that seeks out quality work made by human hands, look at any craft (pottery, glass making, portraiture, fiber work, furniture making) they will always be there, the artists themselves might have to change strategy over time and adapt but that's how it goes in any field. This audience will absolutely pay top dollar for this kind of work though, so I'm super interested as to how the market changes over time.

The discussion last night about what is art is dumb, it's a debate that's been going on for centuries and honestly comes down to, whatever the fuck you perceive to be art, can probably be considered art. This discussion happens all the time around video games, movies, animated movies, pop music, etc.
And it completely misses the point of emerging technology in an artistic concept, which is how can artists utilize these technologies to make even sicker shit. I know people that utilize 3D printing and VR to makes some really insanely sick work, this is very new technology and is already making huge ground in the fine art world, which is exciting for me as an art enjoyer. 

Realistically, AI will weed out middle of the road to bad artists which, is bad for them I guess, or who's to say, idk man. But hyper stylized artists or slightly more well known artists, ones with a following, even if a small one will not be phased out because the author is as important as the work. It's the same reason someone would buy a hand made les paul guitar instead of a much much much cheaper factory made one. Again, the audience might shift but there will still be demand. 

I could be wrong about a lot of AI stuff since I don't fully understand the technology to be completely honest, and haven't really researched it all that well, but I'm open to new information and good conversation regarding it, I just hate seeing the brainlets in chat soy out either way about anything art related when their understanding of most of it is from a 7th grade art history class they slept through.",Watching chat talk about AI art is giving me literal cancer.,1673361454,"Watching chat talk about AI art is giving me literal cancer. Title... All of chat soys out because they think they are logical and objective and artists are dumb and AI art is gigachad because it puts artists out of work or whatever, it's cringe as fuck. 

There's a few things to say here before responding to the arguments made on stream last night, of which I only caught some of. For what it's worth, I went to school for a fine art undergrad.

1. Online freelance artists are ALMOST always fucking cringelords. Nobody really cares how long it takes to create a piece of art, drawing, sculpture, etc. People always tout this as something that makes their work special or unique, literally no potential customer cares, no layperson cares, it's purely self fellatio and genuinely makes all artists look like self entitled losers. 

2. Illustration/graphic design is more akin to a craft than an art. This may be triggering to a lot of freelancers to hear but it's true. Someone that creates emotes, commission work for one off pieces, logos, animated intros for videos, etc. Are working in a more similar manner  to a craftsman creating furniture or a production glassmaker  for a client than they are to a fine artist making work for a series or gallery. To be clear, there is nothing wrong or bad about this but the distinction is pretty important in the context of this conversation.

With that being said here are my thoughts on AI art as it currently stands.

AI is another tool to be used to create amazing work, the same way a camera, or a computer, a Wacom tablet, or a drone with a video camera attached can be used to create amazing work, of course its all about the execution, this will evolve over time, this debate around the medium has happened with every single new emerging medium in art history, it's nothing new and will figure itself out over time, it will be extremely interesting to watch though.

People comparing this to automation are right, it is like automation but the arguments I've heard to capture this as well as I think they could. The conversation shouldn't be about automation per se but around commoditization. The new technology makes custom art more accessible to the general public for sure, this is probably a good thing, as much as it triggers freelancers, having the public engage more with an artistic medium is good, having more people have access to tools to create art is good. **BUT** this is more along the lines of comparing Ikea furniture to furniture made by a master craftsman, yes everyone can now access it but there is a level of skill, talent, understanding of medium and concepts, history, and respect that AI can never put into a piece of art, I think completely writing off these human elements is childish and doesn't serve the conversation at all, these things are so deeply engrained in art and realistically go hand in hand, you almost can't separate them. 

AI art can never fully grasp conceptual work. This topic briefly came up last night and everyone was very understandably out of their element. Conceptual work is made for a very specific audience, an audience that is specifically seeking the deeper meaning behind a piece of series of work, they are looking for what is *not shown* more than what *is shown*. This doesn't mean it's better or worse than aesthetic art, it's just different, it's usually exploratory in nature, sometimes avant garde, and sometimes shocking for the sake of being shocking. This is personally my favorite kind of art, it requires deeper understanding of the artists intention, choices, and the history and context of a piece of work, this is fun for me. Performance art is a great example of something AI art could never recreate, the medium itself is something that changes with each show, it could script a piece I suppose but the actual art is the performance, the audience perception, reception, and reaction. This is why I say it moves more toward automation of a craft than of *art*.

Contemporary art is very shaped by art history, similar to how popular music changes and borrows from music history over time, concepts, mediums, themes, and techniques in fine art do the same. AI can't currently assess these deeper understandings of fine art that humans can, and contextualize art in the way that we do. Sure you could prompt it to create a modern surrealist work and it would spit out something really interesting but there's no *why* there. The AI doesn't have an influence in the way a human artist does. Artists work is shaped by life struggles, was, their environment, other makers in and out of their field of work, their parents, current events, different forms of media, and a multitude of other factors. Artistic movements exist around specific historical events for the most part. DaDa around WW1, surrealism and the work of Freud, pop art and the hyper consumer culture of America in the 50s and 60s, etc. Some movements even develop from other movements like minimalism deriving from cubism and abstract expressionism. As it currently stands, I don't think AI can fully grasp these things, so the art it creates is much more surface level in these regards. 

At the end of the day, as much as it triggers the AI jerkers, this technology will make freelancers more money most likely, there will always be an audience that seeks out quality work made by human hands, look at any craft (pottery, glass making, portraiture, fiber work, furniture making) they will always be there, the artists themselves might have to change strategy over time and adapt but that's how it goes in any field.

3) AI art will take artists jobs

If you're an artist who's job is selling work where your personality isn't part of the product 
Then yes. Your job Photoshopping a logo on Fuverr is probably gone. If you're an artist who selling their personality and life experience and using art as a medium. Then no it won't take your job. You might even benefit from using AI art for what you do

4) Death of the artist

However, as he's area of expertise is focused around making videos, not debating, he may have some difficulty against opponents who does not care about facts. Like Haz during the debate with Adam Something. Therefore, D need to cover him when it comes to these dirty parts.

However, bringing Lazerpig on has its own advantages. As a military analyst of sorts, he is capable of presenting better information than D probably can. Military analysis requires a lot of reading and expertise on certain subjects, which differs from most online debates where morality and presentation matters more. This is useful if Gonzalo tries to use spiked information, like the notorious Ursula Von Der Len casualty number. Moreover, compared to the larger experts, like Perun and Michael Kofman, Lazerpig is very skilled in memes and has a great influence on shitposting communities such as [r/NonCredibleDefense](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonCredibleDefense/), this increases the reward of winning such debate, as Gonzalo could potentially ridicule himself and end up being used against Russian propaganda machine.

To be honest, I believe that D is the one who will carry most of the show, while Lazerpig acts like some sort of consulter who plays auxiliary roles. Gonzalo and the faction he represents is unlikely to engage in large scale talks about military facts, they probably know they are unlikely to win when it comes to knowledge, what they will do, is to use the debate as a tool to boost their fame. They are more likely to talk about the G-word in Donbass than how many HIMARS has been destroyed.

The worst case scenario is when Gonzalo Lira had prepared extensively for this roundtable, probably under instruction from the notorious Internet Research Agency. In that case, the situation may be dire for D and Lazerpig. Russians have been using [active measure](https://tnsr.org/2022/09/whats-old-is-new-again-cold-war-lessons-for-countering-disinformation/) since Soviet Union, often with great success. The tactics employed is mentioned below:

The first phase of their action is to begin with a bombardment of false information. They are unlikely to talk about destroyed HIMARS, as this will just ridicule themselves. However, they are likely to say things that are plain outrageous. As a Chinese myself, I have plenty of examples, such as the claim that folks are harvesting organ out of dead Ukrainian soldiers. It's not about whether or not these claims are correct, but to make the other side feel unpleasant and angry, weakening them mentally.

To counter such action, the key is to keep a record of all the lies the Russian sources have said. This is to provide a rapid response to whatever talking points they brought up. An analogy to the talking points CRP likes to use is that these talking points are like bullets manufactured from factories, single ones are not important, it's the overall volume of fire that matters. By targeting the factories, in this case the Russian media's credibility, the talking points are likely to be shut up for good.

The second phase of their action is when D or Lazerpig quotes mainstream media. Historically saying, Soviet active measure have a tendency to amplify existing grievances. In this case, they will be aiming for the contrarians and populists, who tend to distrust the mainstream media due to anti-establishment belief or resentment. It's never about who's source is right, it's about causing as much trouble as possible. They will embrace a ""salad bar"" like method to portray all the mainstream media source as ""false"", ""controlled"", and ""sheepish"" by combining various form of conspiracy theory, anti-establishment anger, and existing grievances. This relies upon the fact that most populists are just contrarians who watched Matrix, and therefore can hardly be countered by logic.

To deal with such situation, focus on breaking down their narrative and ridicule them by quoting Igor ""Strelkov"" Girkin (COD villain irl). Make them sound like tinfoil hat idiots, try to enrage them into making schizo rants instead of being redpilled hero.

The third phase is when they try to portray it as a morality problem. They probably know Lazerpig cannot be countered easily even if they've brought Douglas MacGregor and Scott Ritter onboard. So instead they will spam ""Muh Donbass Genocide"". If that is true, they might also welcome some ""people"" onboard. Like Eva Bartlett and Patrick Lancaster for tearjerkers. If they are really prepared, maybe they are gonna show some pics of bombed Donetsk children. Gonzalo might do some dogwhistle for white nationalist, especially if Black Pigeon Speaks is onboard.

In this case, D should just focus on fact and read history, make the audience feel that the likes of CRP are trying to manipulate them emotionally. Don't try to be a heartless bastard like me, who think that as the DNR lies occupies my countrymen's brain, we need to use 5 million rockets on them. Real thing, I really think that Yooks should kill 10% of LNR population to avenge holodomor and create a refugee crisis in Russia (basically what Russians do in Syria), and anyone who disagree with me is a naïve limpdick EU idiot who need to see the real world. I don't think I need to talk about crushing WW2 monument with German Vehicles just to piss off the Russians.

The fourth phase is where the fun truly begins. This is the decisive point. ""What about our own border?"" It's never about facts, it's about sending a message to all the marginalized Americans, who are often nihilistic and don't give a fuck about logic.

Such actions may also be accompanied by a ton of gaslighting and insults aimed to coerce the other party to quit. The moderator is likely to be Gonzalo Lira himself.

This is usually hard to counter for military experts like Perun due to their more upper middle class perspective.

Why not have me on and just slam dunk the conversation?""

You see where I'm going with this?

Destiny absolutely does this with Sneako. He keeps him around because he can see three steps ahead on most of the wildly dumb conspiratorial shit sneako will say and otherwise just runs circles around him in areas of knowledge that Sneako hasn't spent the time or effort to get proficient in. 

There really doesn't seem to be any chance that Sneako is going to change his way of thinking through any form of conversation. I think it would take video evidence of Donald Trump and Andrew Tate committing violent crimes on women for him to even begin to start turning his skepticism towards the right. So the only utility he's providing at this point is an easy target with some clout to shoot for.

As a Mexican (Living in Mexico, not Mexican-American) I felt like shit the way he referred to my country as a *fallen and corrupt state* just like Somalia. I don't know as much as I wish about Somalia, but if he just wanted to stir some more shit to make the conversation spicier by just comparing the GDPs and skimming the wikipedia article about the African country there's a massive difference in economic growth, political security and democracy.  
Paraphrasing what Destiny once said in a stream ""I can criticize and talk shit about my own country, but listening to a foreign asshole talk shit about it, makes me mad"", I felt the same shit. Comparing Mexico in economy, security, growth and even social issues to the US is a retarded comparison since not many first world countries can compete with the American nation, but I feel you guys get too comfortable talking shit, biased by horrible news about events in Mexico, and the shitty TV series where you Americans love to put that tacky yellow filter every time you show my country on the screen.  


Mexico's political and economics subjects are complex as any developing nation in the Americas such as Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, we may aspire to a better political environment, better laws and economic reforms, and believe me, we are walking in the right direction with all the political turmoil, after all we tend to copy a lot our neighbors to the north. But all this shit about 'we need to bring some freedom', 'Le Mexican Cartel' that I read in chat tonight, made my blood boil a little bit, we are friendly nations, with the renewed USMCA we export a bunch of agriculture, minerals and work the factories to both the US and Canada for dirt cheap, so cars and electro domestics are affordable to you, we are pretty much your onshore India and China since we are also developing a shit load of your software too, and of course, at the same time you grow the economy in my country. We host vacations to a bunch of Americans and even a whole other bunch are migrating into our cities, sky rocketing rent and home prices making it practically impossible for a bunch of middle class Mexicans to afford. The issues that we have are our own issues, but the responsibility runs both ways, you boost our prices so much than most tourist places, the only Mexican people you'll see are workers, you sell guns to Mexican cartels, you buy and distribute our drugs to the rest of America, so the way that you act all high and mighty ""LULW Mexican Cartel's beheadings"" might fall a little bit in the *out of touch* side of things, compare it to the brits talking shit about school shootings.

495,Destiny,"If you've read through any of the AI art posts in the sub for the past month you might have already seen my argument already but I'll lay it out here again. 

**In this current age of the internet, it seems easy as fuck to max out the hedonistic treadmill just on human-made content alone.** I'm not any happier or more entertained now on a way bigger internet than I was 10 years ago. The human mind acclimates to things very easily and it seems like with the internet, entertainment feels maxed out. Most philosophers and psychologists seem to agree with this concept and the idea of working towards goals and greater meaning is a very common theme when it comes to helping unhappy people in modern times. It seems like for (most) people having something to work towards is necessary to be happy, you cant get by with entertainment alone.

And this is the problem with AI art. The consumer will acclimate, the amazing ability to generate original artwork through prompts rapidly becomes as interesting as a google image search but the artists are *fucked*. There life meaning is gone. Visual arts is an incredibly easy thing for people to find meaning in. There are tons of unique niche styles, so even if your are not the best or just a hobbyist you can have your own style that no one does, and people will value your work. You also always have something greater to work towards because art has an extremely high skill ceiling and you can always get better. If AI can instantly produce better work than you, then whats the point?

""But what about (insert a bunch of other things computers beat humans at, that people adapted too)?"" Art feels more susceptible to meaning loss than these other fields because we value works of art on their own merits. In chess for example even though computers are better, people want to watch two people battle it out, not AI so chess players can still find purpose in trying to be the best human player they can be. (Even still chess does feel a bit devalued when you can cheat by shoving a remote-controlled buttplug up your ass.)

Most of the other reasons to push forward with automation don't really seem to hold up for AI art either. AI art doesn't improve human nutrition, make infrastructure better, or save lives. Perhaps there is some future utility, that training diffusion models on artwork will provide but I'm currently not seeing it. It just kinda feels like the biggest effect AI art is currently having, is making people freak out about AI and depressing artists.

Honestly, beyond alignment, meaning loss is one of the biggest worrying things about AI. Some people will probably be fine, but if you get value from making things, or providing useful contributions, that's gonna be gone. In the future, *anything* that you create is going to be worthless on its own merits because AI will be able to do it better. People take the idea that if they work hard they can provide something of value for granted, and that probably will be coming to an end.

I'm not saying living in a post-scarcity world where everything is taken care of by machines isn't good for a ton of reasons, but its worth noting the problems this is gonna cause even if we avoid dying by superintelligence.",The problem with AI art artists don't want to talk about,1673326301,"The problem with AI art artists don't want to talk about If you've read through any of the AI art posts in the sub for the past month you might have already seen my argument already but I'll lay it out here again. 

**In this current age of the internet, it seems easy as fuck to max out the hedonistic treadmill just on human-made content alone.** I'm not any happier or more entertained now on a way bigger internet than I was 10 years ago. The human mind acclimates to things very easily and it seems like with the internet, entertainment feels maxed out. Most philosophers and psychologists seem to agree with this concept and the idea of working towards goals and greater meaning is a very common theme when it comes to helping unhappy people in modern times. It seems like for (most) people having something to work towards is necessary to be happy, you cant get by with entertainment alone.

And this is the problem with AI art. The consumer will acclimate, the amazing ability to generate original artwork through prompts rapidly becomes as interesting as a google image search but the artists are *fucked*. There life meaning is gone. Visual arts is an incredibly easy thing for people to find meaning in. There are tons of unique niche styles, so even if your are not the best or just a hobbyist you can have your own style that no one does, and people will value your work. You also always have something greater to work towards because art has an extremely high skill ceiling and you can always get better. If AI can instantly produce better work than you, then whats the point?

""But what about (insert a bunch of other things computers beat humans at, that people adapted too)?"" Art feels more susceptible to meaning loss than these other fields because we value works of art on their own merits. In chess for example even though computers are better, people want to watch two people battle it out, not AI so chess players can still find purpose in trying to be the best human player they can be. (Even still chess does feel a bit devalued when you can cheat by shoving a remote-controlled buttplug up your ass.)

Most of the other reasons to push forward with automation don't really seem to hold up for AI art either. AI art doesn't improve human nutrition, make infrastructure better, or save lives. Perhaps there is some future utility, that training diffusion models on artwork will provide but I'm currently not seeing it. It just kinda feels like the biggest effect AI art is currently having, is making people freak out about AI and depressing artists.

Honestly, beyond alignment, meaning loss is one of the biggest worrying things about AI. Some people will probably be fine, but if you get value from making things, or providing useful contributions, that's gonna be gone. In the future, *anything* that you create is going to be worthless on its own merits because AI will be able to do it better. People take the idea that if they work hard they can provide something of value for granted, and that probably will be coming to an end.

499,Destiny,"So based on what was said in the recent stream/video regarding rumors I think I have deduced what has been going on.

First off, this is mostly speculation on my part.

XQC claims that he is not married, never was in the past either.

So what about the ""divorce""? Well, this is probably adept trying to claim common law marriage in Texas because they where a couple for many years.

**However** you would have to agree to it in writing mutually and have called each other spouses among other things. This seems highly unlikely on XQCs part.

Based on the **legal** document, we can see that Adept was the one that filed it.

So Adept filed a seemingly bogus ""divorce"" claim and used it to get a TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) and a Rule 11 agreement.

A TRO in this case is about seizing assets/money, where no party is allowed to try and move money in any significant way. **NOT** about stalking and not being able to be a specific distance from each other.

The Rule 11 agreement could have been what they where talking about. The Tesla car in this case. Where she is allowed to use it. A friend apparently was using it and XQC reset the password, witch caused said person to be stranded. Adept got mad and wanted revenge on XQC so she gets over to his house and shouts ""court case"" to deliberately give stream that information and mess with him.

Adept seems to be even more toxic of a person then I thought based on all this. It's all about money/cars/assets and extracting as much of it from XQC as possible.

I do not know why these things where agreed upon when she has no real claim of marriage. But that is probably being worked on right now. This is why he couldn't directly speak on it on stream.

Again this is all alleged and mostly speculation.","Censored on r/xqc, thought I'd repost here so that any discussion can continue",1673325252,"Censored on r/xqc, thought I'd repost here so that any discussion can continue So based on what was said in the recent stream/video regarding rumors I think I have deduced what has been going on.

512,Destiny," This is my first effort post so bear with me.

One of my favorite books of all time is Walter Benjamin’s *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction*. It’s a super short book and essentially it’s about how being able to replicate changes how we engage with it. He uses examples of us going from hieroglyphs to paintings to photography to film and sound. How we went from worshiping art privately at holy sites to worshiping them publicly in museums. About how when art is widely available it sometimes becomes worthless, an afterthought.

Way back in the day, if you wanted a portrait of yourself, you had to go find a painter and sit down with them for 10 hours while they painted you. This changed with the camera. With that, all you had to do was find a photographer and sit down for 10 minutes, and even more, get a picture-perfect (for the time) representation of yourself.

Artists were outraged, they said “this isn’t art”, “there’s no skill involved” there’s no love or thought in this”, “this is putting me out of business”. Sounds kind of familiar. It did put a lot of artists out of business, it did make the portrait an afterthought, it was a big event, you could always just get another one. Sounds pretty familiar doesn’t it? “Just enter another prompt!”

Take a more recent example, the invention of Hip-Hop, specifically the practice of sampling. A lot of artists said “this is not music, ”this is just noise” “this is theft”, “you’re just stealing”, “it’s lazy”, etc. Some of this is true, but what made Hip-Hop different was that as it progressed, it became normalized, it began to be recognized as a genre of its own. The artists who were getting sampled were now receiving royalties from licensing agreements. Society was happy, and a few generations later it’s the biggest genre on the planet. Hip-Hop didn’t put anyone out of business, it made business. And even in the cultural sense sparked a culture built on the foundation and appreciation (even indirectly) of older music. There have been plenty of times where I’ve heard a song and went and looked up the sample and listened to that. It’s FAR from perfect with label disputes and this and that, contracts and stuff, but a system was built and we learned to live with it, love it, and hate it. And from that reform will come.

AI art will definitely put people out of business, absolutely, but who ever said that evolution was peaceful? I don’t see why we feel entitled to safety in this regard. AI art will hurt people, it will make people appreciate art less, it will be abused and make people angry, it will damage our spirit, but most of all, it will bring us into the future. Art to me is simply a language communicating the world's most violent impulses, but it doesn’t matter what my definition is, same you for and yours. The definition changes every day. All that matters is that the work of art, is simply a work in progress, one that we have to respect, no matter how painful, for it will lead us to the next Hip-Hop, or the next cinematography, or the next photography, or the next museum, church, and hieroglyphic. That is the work of art in the age of digital reproduction, a loose thread connecting the past to the future.

(My prescriptive opinion is that in a theoretical world, there would be some system where artists have to consent to have their art used in AI programs and receive some kind of credit, or monetary compensation. But I have no idea how that would be done.)

And then it becomes a big carnival where everyone suddenly jumps in to give and argue their own definition of art and what art is. Don't even get me started on the copyright law, jesus christ - and then Sejin comes in with ""ArT iS a LaNGuaGe"" to derail the whole thing onto another track.

If Ai art gen is still going to need human artist's artworks to use in the future in it's database, then wouldn't that mean ai art isn't creating art in the same way as humans? Even worst, despite it's insurmountable amount of references in its database, what reason should ai, at this point, require further artworks from human artists? And yet i still see some people trying to add in more artworks in their ai generators. If have those same references and processing brain power, fuck, i wouldn't need anymore references, because i'll be a fucking God of Art if that ever happens.

Second point, Ai Art DOES NOT create art in same way as humans. The level of control a human artist has over their work isn't something an ai art can do, atleast currently. Anybody who denies this, is on some super tight copium. There's a reason why the concept artworks you get have pretty generic perspectives, or anime artworks with generic angles in some generic poses.

And because ai art lack this level of control, the level of preference the user has over the generated images is also limited. And that's ASSUMING the user know what preferences they actually want from their ai art.

530,Destiny,"**What is Art?**  

Sorry for this cringe topic that makes every artist roll their eyes, I’ll try to be brief and concise. The only thing that matters for defining something as “art” is whether or not someone considers it art. This could be the creator or a viewer doesn’t matter. The definition of art’s parameters have been pushed over the years to broaden it to be literally anything. Crushing up some dust and calling it art is fine. In this way art requires a human element to define it as such. Duchamp is most famous for taking found objects and sticking them together, putting it in a gallery and calling it art. He had to fight for that in his time but today nobody in the world of art will bat an eye at calling that art. Literally anything can be art, it can also be literally nothing but a hypothetical idea, there are artists who only write about a hypothetical proposed art “thing” and that idea itself is art. Art today is more about ideas than any object or image, it doesn’t have to physically exist or be beautiful or anything, it can be literally anything. All it needs is someone to call it art. Now if an AI deems something art whether we accept that is going to be really just based on how much weight we give the opinion of an AI. Honestly how much weight we'd give to the opinion of AI is a far more interesting discussion that I'm sure will shift as AI gets more advanced.

**What's In a Word?**

If the term ""art"" is so impossibly broad to include anything anyone considers art, isn't it too broad to be useful? Yeah, sort of yes sort of no. Thinking of it as a label is worthless, but it is useful in drawing a dialogue between art in the history of art and the interconnection between these things. All art exists in a dialogue with the history of art and calling something invokes that history. But if you are trying to use the word art to definitionally draw limits and boundaries you are missing the mark. It can only include and not exclude, the entire history of art is expansion. The only times the definition if art has shrunk has been like, in authoritarian governments where they try to relegate art to favorable propaganda and destroy all else. This is the same as when you see all those right wing morons try to define art as only including classical art.

**Are AI Images Art?**

Yes. But does it matter? No. Whether or not something is art is a boring question that doesn’t matter much, so why do people keep asking and talking about it? I think the reason is because people attach value to the notion of “art”, but this is a wrong way to think about it. Literal trash can be art, value has nothing to do with art, effort has nothing to do with art, money has nothing to do with art, but people erroneously use it in these ways all the time. What they really are trying to say is “this isn’t good art” because it was made by AI, this position is basically the same as when photography entered the scene and people did not consider that art because it’s just snapping a photo like a copier, but today we absolutely consider photography art and AI art will be no different.

**Two Kinds of Art**

Art is basically split into two separate but intertwined realms, generally today we would refer to them as “commercial art” and “fine art” but it all falls under the huge amorphous umbrella of art. Originally art primarily served very practical function, to illustrate a thing. Most all artists existed to make portraits of rich patrons or record history and myths and whatnot. How good an artist was considered was almost entirely determined by how well they could recreate reality like a copier. Eventually technology advanced and photography entered the scene and art had a crisis of identity because the camera could do everything artists did but better and faster. So art reinvented itself to be more about ideas than illustration and they created the whole art scene which was and is considered more prominent than mere illustration because after all, mere illustration is child's play by this point, anyone can do it in seconds. Funny enough after the fine art scene was created photographers were the ones left out in the cold and they had to fight and claw their ways back into being considered art. The kind of artists being replaced by AI art are basically in this category now, they are being replaced by AI like many illustrative artists were replaced by the camera. And honestly, I don’t say this to be mean, but in many ways these digital artists have more in common with cog makers in a factory than the fine artists making art in galleries and museums today. Sorry but your effort and skill mean nothing to art today and replacing it with AI is inevitable. In fine art effort and skill have been considered obsolete for a long time now, there are plenty of artists who don’t ever touch any of their work they just write up schematics and tell a crew to assemble it and nobody thinks twice about it. I know this makes people upset because they want to believe that effort has value for effort’s sake but it doesn’t necessarily mean a damn thing.",On Art and AI,1673318592,"On Art and AI **What is Art?**

556,Destiny,"This is obviously in regard to the conversation around Andrew Tate. I've seen numerous videos and clips of Destiny promulgating the the behaviors Andrew Tate engaged in ""**are**"" sex trafficking and that ""**he is**"" a sex trafficker. 

But frankly this perspective seems to remove a lot of the nuance that Destiny usually engages these topics with, especially when it comes to topics of sex and consent. My main contention here is that the essential factor that's up for debate is to what degree elements of force were used. If Tate was truthful about the business proposition (with regards to what the work was) and the girls had the freedom to come and go as they please (plus contact family, etc), and there was no violence involved in order to keep the women there - where exactly is the human trafficking element here? 

Destiny continually likes to bring up that Tate would set up meeting with women and would bring another woman along to help convince the ""prospective employees"" of the opportunity.,,but that's standard business practices as far as im concerned. There's nothing **inherently** wrong with that. 

From my understanding:

1. The girls were fully aware and consented to what Tate was proposing with regards to cam shows 
2. The girls were fully aware and consented that they would be moving to a different country to live in his home to preform this work
3. The girls had bodily autonomy with regards to when they would work and if they wanted to leave
4. The girls were able to contact family and friends at any point
5. The girls were paid well (even though he took a larger %)

If this would have been any other buisness than cam shows, i don't think people would be so quick to use this label i.e if this would have been a ""female tiktok content house"" i don't think people would be suggesting that he was engaging in human trafficking of any sort **given** elements of force and violence weren't used to **force** these women to engage in various activities. 

As another example - i would be willing to be that Destiny has used Melina (or any of the other girls he's had sexual relations with) to ""convince"" women engage in sex acts. We wouldn't suggest that he was engaging in sex trafficking even though he would be employing largely the same tactics that Tate used. 

So when exactly does something no longer become a personal choice and instead becomes human/sex trafficking?",When does personal choice become trafficking?,1673311894,"When does personal choice become trafficking?

567,Destiny,"Destiny specifically stated that what he values in humans is the necessary capacity for semantic understanding that defines the human experiences as is.

There is a simple hypothetical I want to pose, which is not necessarily non-factual.

Let us say that in the next decade we establish in the most rigorous scientific way that whatever structure or capacity Destiny is referring to right now is not actually present in new borns. The new born is sentient, but the capacity for that type of semantic, supposed necessity for human experience, does not actually occur until 8 months after the child was born, on average, around the time when infants develop the ability to perceive object permanence.

Let us put Destiny into a similar hypothetical world, in which a device exists that is capable of establishing truth with absolute reliability. The absolute reliability of the device is known and epistemically justified by Destiny.

Before Destiny lies in new born infant. He asks the device whether or not the infant has the necessary capacity for semantic understanding that Destiny deems as the fundamental differentiator between animal and human, and therefore what he truly values. The device tells him that the infant lacks said capacity, and that the brain will continue to develope until structures emerge which give rise to that capacity.

At that point, Destiny should have no ethical qualm with eradicating the infant, if his description of his values was honest and accurate. If Destiny truly values the proposed capacity, then lacking that capacity is the determining factor of care. If his moral concern for the being still remains, his proposed value is a lie.

If at that point he would attempt to find another thing that he claims he actually values, it means that his entire philosophical system is a bad faith attempt at avoiding certain moral conclusions. He is attempting to find a differentiating factor, not because he genuinely cares about that factor, but because he wants to uphold a certain moral conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

His values are not actually his values, they are a stand in philosophical facade to protect his inconsistency. And that inconsistency is that he does not care about logical consistency in moral values, he cares about perceived logical consistency. He does not attempt to genuinely discover and describe his values, and then find a way to resolve the necessary inconsistencies (like for one being against the arbitrary discrimination of individuals, while at the same time arbitrarily discriminating against individuals). He instead attempts to veil his internal moral contradictions by creating a system which appears consistent, but which proposed values he does not actually hold.",A hypothetical showcasing the bad faith of Destiny in regards to the proclaimed evaluation of his subjectivity,1673309767,"A hypothetical showcasing the bad faith of Destiny in regards to the proclaimed evaluation of his subjectivity Destiny specifically stated that what he values in humans is the necessary capacity for semantic understanding that defines the human experiences as is.

583,Destiny,"Credentials: been using steroids to some extent for 7+ years. Competed in powerlifting, member of university powerlifting club, strength training enthusiast for over a decade. 

I haven't caught many livestreams lately but heard Destiny go on a rant about steroids after touching the topic of Mizkif on a highlights video. 

I started using testosterone at 25 after extensive research and exprience in the weight room. I chose to do so because I paid for a https://www.privatemdlabs.com/ test which was the gold standard for independent testing outside of a doctor's referal for hormones on r/steroids back in 2015ish. I was riiiight on the brink of low T but when I showed my PCP this information they essentially said ""you're in the reference range, you're 25, you don't need to do anything about it"". 

I decided to go on a cycle and my life changed for the better ever since then. My confidence and sex drive increased, no more random episodes of ED, obviously gains at the gym exploded (they were stagnating while natural but nothing that was causing me any grief). Basically the things that I experienced going on exogenous hormones were cures to problems I didn't realize I had. 

There are numerous downsides to using hormones and I would never recommend it to anyone unless they are well-researched and realize that fucking with hormones can cause permanent effects on fertility, balding, and many other things. I would ABSOLUTELY never recommend anyone touch any hormones before the age of 25 and before strength training and eating properly for 5+ years as well. 

**All that being said, Destiny's main take that I have issue with is ""roids will never make you fat, roids are a cheat code"".** 

That is simply not true. There are many people at your local gym who are using hormones who look like shit and you would never know it, I promise you. Go take a look at r/steroids, I have no idea what the community is like these days but 7 years ago there were plenty of mid-20s guys who looked totally normal that were taking enormous amounts of gear. 

From personal experience, at 27-28 I remember running a cycle of 500mg Test-E/500mg Tren-E/500mg Mast-E per week for 12 weeks, trained extremely well, but ate like a disgusting animal (5000kcal+ per day, fast food all the time, etc). I was reckleslly running a cycle like this because I had lost a ton of weight and was the leanest I'd ever been (215lb @ 6'3""). I ballooned up to 265lb over 12 weeks but I looked like a bloated sack of shit, even with these super dry compounds at pretty crazy doses in my opinion for a non-pro. Yeah I had veins and was huge and had cannonball delts, but to the average person I just had a dadbod with some muscle. 

Steroids are not a cheat code, if you don't know what you're doing and you aren't disciplined you will still look like flabby fucking shit. 

Now I just run TRT dose of testosterone and probably will forever because I had low T at 25 and feel much better with negiligible sides doing this.",Destiny has bad takes on steroids,1673303984,"Destiny has bad takes on steroids Credentials: been using steroids to some extent for 7+ years.

Destiny recently on a panel, with that other dude [""Rise Of Lonely Single Men And Women's Biggest Complaint w/ Dating Apps""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0OQzaeZr4) (Or maybe another related video) I believe touched on this topic a little bit. 

I guess, I wanted to hear an opposite side to this. Are single mothers (Even single dads) over generalized? In terms of dating? I'm curious what Destiny's opinion on this is? He is a single dad after-all, how did that affect his relationship with Malena (If he ever touched on that)?"
586,Destiny,"This is a post specifically for Taftaj from my experiences. I just see her acting in so many ways so many trans women i've tried to support have and it's really frustrating to see it broadcast to a wider audience when it's so cancerous to be flinging your own trans issues so wildly at what I assume is a decent trans audience of hers.

As a passing trans woman who has been living like this for well over a decade. Taftaj's self hate posting and coy ""oh this is what I really mean"" is really frustrating. What she posts on twitter is nowhere near what she argued on stream and it just comes off as spreading her own unhappiness on her platform to as many people as possible. 

Nothing she's saying is perse wrong, but the obvious thing is that she can only see it in a doomer negative view rather than a normal neutral view. 

Whoever got the idea in her head that transition is the nearly only way or should be the main way to fix trans people's mental health and if it doesn't succeed at that it's therefore a failure is just wrong. I know that it's a common view touted even in the medical field but it's just not founded in anything, as she herself pointed out. It's fundamental for trans people to seek regular therapy and help to move through tangentially related mental health issues that often crop up from simply living the trans experience pre or post transition. Her implication that if she had waited until she was an adult to transition she wouldn't have been so terminally online is just not realistic for the vast majority of the trans community. Most of the trans dysphoria comes pre transition and whether it alleviates or not post transition, not taking it on is not going to keep a pretrans person from developing many of our non-trans mental health issues which come about from literally having this gender issue stuck in your head and coping with how it relates to society.

She might imagine herself becoming a regular cis male then later in life switching to how she is now and skipping years of suffering online as a trans person but it's just not realistic. You're going to be tackling that mental health issue from the first day it starts taking over your mind until you either die or find peace with it. Most pre-trans and post-trans people live pretty similar lives to before if they don't take massive steps to change their life outside of simply transitioning. Simply put, it's as easy to live as a homebound online loser pre-transition as post and nothing trans related will fix that on its own.

But most importantly it seems like she has a goal to be a cis woman. Which is fine and typical for most trans women. Now we can't ever literally become 100% cis, we all know that. The real question is if you can accept being 99.999% cis in all situations with the last part being your history. And if you can reach that 99.999% cis passing and accept that then the real healing can start where you can lower that percentage to 90% cis or lower as you become better at coping with the inherent realities of sex and gender and society. 

The reason so many non-passing trans people are seething at her is that they perceive her already being at 99% cis woman, where as many can not ever achieve over 50%. Yet many still find peace with themselves regardless of how much they pass as cis woman and how close they actually are to them. And as someone who has experienced that seething, it does suck and it does erase our lived experiences and struggles. Obviously ""you pass so be happy"" isn't going to work. 

But there are methods that can work to bring your life into the norm and reduce your suffering. Hundreds in fact, and most of the literature says they all work pretty much equally. It's called therapy and various therapeutic techniques. Are they a sure fire? No. For therapy to work you need to use it as a tool to chisel away at your own problem. Nobody and no pill and nothing can drag you over the finish line. 

Enough seething: Here's my recommendation to all trans people that are stuck in gender dysphoria hell from my experiences with so many trans women and myself, but most importantly to taftaj and her predicament. 

1. Transition so at least you feel like you can go out as a woman - step 1 secured by taftaj
2. Go to both trans therapy (you gotta anyways) and any other type of therapy of your choice. I personally like CBT but afaik all the licensed ones work more or less. - I think she's here, I hope.
3. Start tackling your life problems like a cis person would. Take on a veil of ignorance on trans aspects from as many of your life problems as possible and tackle those first and foremost the way your therapeutic choice encourages you to do as if they were dealing with any other cis person. 
4. Stop delving into trans theory. Over self inspection is not something ANYBODY can do lightly and requires extreme levels of self esteem and self objectivity to start avoiding self imposed biases that will just trap you further. You are not Descartes, stop staring into the abyss. 
5. For mostly passing trans people like taftaj, go outside and build up your positive gender euphoria experiences. If you set yourself up to have mostly bad experiences they will weigh in your mind hardest. It is not cheating or fooling yourself to go out of your way to positively reinforce your happiness in your life, it's what most happy people do inherently. ***GET THE FUCK OFF THE INTERNET AND STOP WATCHING CONTENT LIKE MATT WALSH THAT YOU KNOW IS JUST GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE SHIT NO MATTER HOW ""GOOD"" HIS POINTS MIGHT BE TO YOU. YOU HAVE TO BE HAPPY BEFORE YOU CAN BE CORRECT.*** 

For taftaj specifically: 
People are not delusional when they tell you pass mostly as a cis woman. But I know you don't always feel this and that's 100% valid. But it's time to start checking your internal thoughts with reality. 

When I was younger I went stealth 100%. Did I always pass 99.99%? No way. Did it matter? Not when I was passing nearly all the time and reinforcing others positive perceptions of me in my mind. The euphoria way overwhelmed the dysphoria over time. How did I get to this point? By specifically putting myself out there as a cis woman over and over to build up that belief. The baby trans starts with r/passing and omegle. The fully realized trans makes friends in stealth, goes on tinder in stealth (but doesn't meet people in dangerous situations), lives as stealth. And you see how long you can go as a full cis woman. You and I are at the point where if you move cities and nobody knows who you are likely nobody will find out. Each of these interactions should reinforce in you that you are a cis woman to other people. Getting she/her isn't usually enough, but you know what really reinforces that you're passing? Having your friends say transphobic shit around you or talk about other trans people. Once it becomes obvious it's not even in their mind you might be trans it just takes a lot of mental gymnastics to not convince yourself. This is all about how to pass and how to convince yourself you pass. But here's the thing. Once you do convince yourself you pass and that dysphoria alleviates you will realize how little it changes in your life. 

Living as a trans woman without having transphobia get in your way, internal or external is really similar to living as a cis woman. Once you see that concept in action it makes living as a 100% passing cis feel less important, at least it did for me, because there was no actual change in my life. I was living the benefits of being 100% passing at 75% passing more or less. I don't think I can get you to this point specifically but if you can get to the point where you don't feel constant dysphoria over the passing question that should be good enough. 

I'll say that at this point in my life i do not live stealth and I stopped trying to pass. Mostly I don't do the voice stuff anymore because the benefits it gives me isn't worth the work to me. That's just personal. Now I never pass on the phone or just through voice. But because I know I can if I want to and have come to peace with the fact my life is almost always that of a cis woman so why would I put in that extra work for the last percentage? That's just my experience. After a while I got very disillusioned with how living as stealth keeps me from being able to voice my beliefs on trans issues and the inherent lying about my past. But those issues need not be a big deal. JUst not quite my tempo. 

I hope the last parts where our goals and experiences diverge doesn't make you uninterested in the rest of what I have to say because from my experience those key steps are the major difference between happy trans people I know and depressed trans people I know. 

I know you have the tools you need to live a happy life. But nobody can do it but yourself. While you are suffering try not to constantly broadcast it as nothing spreads suffering like company. Especially un-nuanced internet company. 

I hope all the best for you, please stop shitting up DGG and the trans community with your shitty hot takes you have a million layers of nuance hidden only in your own mind.

 I think ""legwork"" is superior as it conveys the same meaning as ""heavy lifting"" only (A) without being so on the nose that it defeats its own purpose as an idiom while (B) being a far more dynamic descriptor, which can even hint at a sly willfulness on the part of the addressee.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the quickest way to debunk chuds arguments is to look at the time stamps in the text messages. People like Chud are trying to make it seem like huge amounts of time passed. The rape happened early January 1st  so prob anywhere from 2 AM to 5 AM. She admits she didn’t go to the hospital until the next day which she sent the first text at the hospital at 4:58 AM Monday. So almost 24 hours since it happened. Because per the lil boom interview and her statements made on her Twitter thread she was crying so much that she didn’t do it right after. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\[Timeline\]([https://twitter.com/thejovipena/status/1611225918088806400?s=46&amp;t=nmjQnMpqIEQKMZ7WyoUrjA](https://twitter.com/thejovipena/status/1611225918088806400?s=46&amp;t=nmjQnMpqIEQKMZ7WyoUrjA))So these next 24 hours are important. Between 4:58 AM Monday and 4:58 AM Tuesday we know both the rape kit and the police report were submitted. Because according to both of them the police was contacted within 24 hours. So the time Kai was being “dismissive” was between 9:03 AM Monday and 4:58 AM Tuesday.  Because she confirmed and he confirmed that Kai was in talks with the police. So In less than 24 hours of her coming forward to the proper authorities Kai also was cooperating with the same authorities. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now I posted the link to the text. We can break down from the time Kai woke up at 9:03 AM until he stopped responding to her. Her messages after Kai woke up said she was getting a rape kit done and not to let the rapist know. Now here is something you have judge with your own morality. Kai has known this girl for a total of 2 days at this point. And has known the alleged rapist for 5+ years. He ends up confronting the alleged Rapist. I think it’s a normal human response to confront your friends first. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 2:29 PM Monday she sent a full picture of the alleged rapist and Kai responds “its himmmmm?” now this can be interpreted two ways. He didn’t know him or he’s shocked that it’s a person he knows. I’m leaning on the he’s shocked. Kai doesn’t respond right away and then says he’s currently in a meeting figuring things out. This meeting is probably one with his legal team. Which is confirmed to be real by Jovi on the lil boom interview \[Lil Boom Interview\]([https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1698934320](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1698934320)) and on her Instagram story later. Jovi admits to talking to a woman from his legal team and her words are that this woman really helped and listened to her. So him not responding right away at this point is because he is in a meeting. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

More text go by and Kai says the guy he sent upstairs to check on her and that guy are two different people. Then we get to Chuds biggest piece of evidence that Kai is openly lying to her \[Chud evidence\]([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/525342714003456010/1062017406089842759/IMG\_5089.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/525342714003456010/1062017406089842759/IMG_5089.png)). One interpretation is Kai is lying the other is he is still talking to his legal team and because it’s his friend they are trying to make sure that it’s him. Now is this being dismissive 100% but again this up to your moral judgement as I said. He is trying to confront his friend first. No where does Kai say explicitly he didn’t know the individual. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here the time gets wonky because there are no timestamps but we know again that it’s a 24 hour window so it’s between 2:30 PM Monday to 4:58 AM Tuesday. They get into a heated exchange over text where she accuses Kai of setting her up. He gets super defensive and is telling her he is getting all the info. Any reasonable person would get defensive. Here is why Kai had to make a live stream was because he was getting accused of being involved. You can decide for yourself whether it was a good or bad live stream. Eventually Kai stops responding I’m assuming his legal team told him to stop the same legal team confirmed to be true. So this would line up with both their statements as to why he stopped responding. They both confirmed that she received a paragraph from the legal team that he would no longer be responding. So this debunks that Kai got that order during the time of this text thread. So Kai was doing this on his own. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Timeline speed run. Kai’s legal team did not respond to her all of Tuesday. At some point on Wednesday they gave her and I’m assuming the police the name of the alleged rapist. Thursday she made the story public. Friday it blew up and Kai did his live stream.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From this timeline I have laid out Kai cooperated with police within 24 hours of her going to the hospital. And gave the name of the alleged rapist within 24-36 hours of him knowing who it was. So in 3 days Kai has done everything a 3rd party is legally able to do. Now you can say morally he could’ve given the name up when he saw the first picture but he was being a normal human. No one makes the correct logical and moral decision 100% of the the time. The worse thing he did was not be super sympathetic and not be the best communicator. But it’s the first time he has been a situation like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope Jovi gets her Justice and the guy who did it gets thrown under the jail.  Kai has gone above and beyond what any of these other streamers have done.",Chudlogic is Wrong about the Kai situation [Effort post],1673286145,"Chudlogic is Wrong about the Kai situation [Effort post] I just watched the YouTube video of Destiny discussing this with Chudlogic.

Maybe I am totally at the wrong address, but I thought it would be worth a try. The new patch will bring a lot of group activities/opportunities, and with strength in numbers we can get enough money for everyone faster, then alone.

I'm in EU, but I'm open to anyone joining, and testing if we can play together on the same server

Maybe you're an active player, or have an account laying around, but no matter what's inside your hangar, together we can achieve anything! 

Maybe I am totally at the wrong address, but I thought it would be worth a try. The new patch will bring a lot of group activities/opportunities, and with strength in numbers we can get enough money for everyone faster, then alone.

I'm in EU, but I'm open to anyone joining, and testing if we can play together on the same server

It is always a joke about how insane destiny beliefs are mostly because they are inconsistent meat eaters or vegans that talk about it e.g. thinking that killing, torturing, and rapping animals is fine. Now this is just what you have to believe to be a consistent meat eater but something that Destiny has only really ever done once was show just how insane you would have to be against animals to be a true vegan.

If you really wanted to be consistent as a vegan you would have to believe that killing all carnivores is something that ought be done as their existence is predicated on killing other sentient beings so cull all cats(they cant be vegan), lions, foxes, sharks, dolphins, e.c.t. although will have to add an addendum that is is okay to let carnivores eat each other but ones that eat herbivores have to go. So the only argument that a vegan can really make here is that these animals have the less agency than a 4 year old and if a 4 year old killed people we wouldn't sentence the 4 year old to death we would confine them. That is true but what I would say is that we don't have to resources to confine every single animal like we do with the rare case of a 4 year old and in that case not stopping them is basically allowing billions of meat eater serial killers to kill and hurt herbivores. Also in the case of a 4 year old if we literally couldn't contain that 4 year old we would kill em.

Adept was effectively his caretaker, enabling Felix to be a GOBLIN and stream for 16 hours daily. You know, the thing that his career tremendously benefited from.  In addition, it seems Adept was handling a lot of managerial stuff like moving houses, travel, house maintenance, day-to-day shit. All of that and more was not compensated, thus, she deserves a fair recompense for her work that partially played part in X reaching the hights that he did.  


Now, preemtively addressing all the mouth breathers. Words in *cursive* are to be read in a strawman voice.

* ""*But, but, but she knocked on his door and, and, and she is crazy.""*   
Yes, she is crazy. So? Still deserves a fair compensation, regardless of all the crazy shit she did after the break up.
* *""But X never represented their relationship as marriage, thus it was not a common law marriage uder the statue 69.420 of Texas penal code."" \*Tips fedora\**  
True, legally she might not have a standing. However, this basically concedes the whole argument. The reason why after divorce working partner has to pay up their stay-at-home spouse is because we recognize the contribution of the latter to the career success of the former. 
* ""You assumed a lot of shit about their relationship"".

Adept was effectively his caretaker, enabling Felix to be a GOBLIN and stream for 16 hours daily. You know, the thing that his career tremendously benefited from.  In addition, it seems Adept was handling a lot of managerial stuff like moving houses, travel, house maintenance, day-to-day shit. All of that and more was not compensated, thus, she deserves a fair recompense for her work that partially played part in X reaching the hights that he did.  


Now, preemtively addressing all the mouth breathers. Words in *cursive* are to be read in a strawman voice.

* ""*But, but, but she knocked on his door and, and, and she is crazy.""*   
Yes, she is crazy. So? Still deserves a fair compensation, regardless of all the crazy shit she did after the break up.
* *""But X never represented their relationship as marriage, thus it was not a common law marriage uder the statue 69.420 of Texas penal code."" \*Tips fedora\**  
True, legally she might not have a standing. However, this basically concedes the whole argument. The reason why after divorce working partner has to pay up their stay-at-home spouse is because we recognize the contribution of the latter to the career success of the former. 
* ""You assumed a lot of shit about their relationship"".  
That's a valid point, I did assume a lot. If it turns out that Adept wasn't X's caretaker to the extend it seems and did not do anything management-related for him, then there is nothing to be compensated for and she is being an entitled ex.

740,Destiny,"Upon growing up a bit, I realized that being a libertarian was just an emotional ego statement. I couldn’t even finish Atlas Shrugged. It's prob one of the boringest books I've ever picked up. Well composed enough but the content was mind numbing. I've largely written off this school of thought as a feisty adolescent wet dream. ""I do what I want.""

Though, there are elements of righteousness, in practice we can see there's no place that proves by example it's value and the maximal path that it leads one to of ""anarchy"" is just as max ally absurd and almost a pathetic position to hold in this day and age. For more than a number of reasons 

But I would like to understand the full extent of the arguments and be able to steal man the school of thought myself, since woefully, most normal people can't even hold a candle in debate on these topics. That being said, I've never in person or threw communication of ideas threw any other medium, found anyone doing much service to the ideas. So typically that's not a red herring. One only needs to watch a libertarian party debate conference / primary to examine the mindlessness of its ideas being flaunted in just words not even practice.

Now, so I don't offend people with this proclamation as well... I'm a very mixed hybrid type person. I like our model now but seek to erode the corruptive perverse incentives by
having a melting pot of ideas to push back from all angles. Keeping any one side in check by the
voice and existence of the polarity. 

There are some libertarians principles and critiques of the modern world that are spot on (which 'happen' to be correct - often for different reasons - like math the work must be shown) and I'm glad we have people tuned from all ranges of belief to illustrate
these pit falls. That being said, of course the current social maelstrom is far beyond driven in more toxic paths with ill intended course (largely because of perverse incentives). We can’t afford to lose ourselves in a paradox of intolerance and must educate on the basic precursors (the whys not just the how) for the system to be the fittest of all, despite its many short comings and failures. People tend to be the problem not the systems. As many different systems work for many different specific reasons, more or less. 

And to be even more clear. I sort of see this maxim, as a starting point to work back from in a way; as a place to derive ideal but then to be rationale and realist with trade offs /cost and benefits. Agian a range of models: (what I call) soft deontology that’s subjectively judicious and relative, that’s originally guided by utilitarianism and virtue ethics with a smearing over stroke of pragmatism and prudence. (In brief).

The suggestion I heard recently was I should have done the ""Fountain Head"" first. I worry that if it’s anywhere near the dribble that Atlas Shrugged was, that I won’t manage to get even 1/2 way threw.

Destiny says Ethan will ALWAYS be in the wrong for calling Andrew tate a sex trafficker because he did it with no evidence. This isn’t entirely true, Ethan was one of the first people to look at that website which he clearly states himself doing almost the exact definition of human trafficking, with that and the combination of the circumstances of his first arrest, I think it’s pretty fair to call someone a human trafficker. Why? We call these crypto guys scammers all day, not because they have been charged with fraud or something, but because of what they have said and done.


Other than Andrew tate getting arrested for human trafficking, what major evidence has come out? That Bruce rivers video was made with all stuff previously public, the only reason destiny believes the charges heavily now is because he has seen what Andrew has said. Ethan has been picking the Andrew tate bone for content since may,  h3 subreddit was filled with all the clips we are seeing now.


In conclusion if you want to say he is sort of wrong for jumping the gun, sure, but saying he will always be wrong like he said that out of no evidence whatsoever isn’t true (not that destiny said that but I thought it was insinuated).

Also I said should not can just to get your both logical and/or emotional opinion. Also feel free to argue about this. 

&gt;!My opinion is a yes. I think you are due some percentage of assets. I'll probably search up if this has ever happened and what the ruling was. I think it could be scary tho. It would make a lot of people scared of getting sued in case DNA records showed their family owned slaves and that success of owning slaves still impacted their assets to modern day. I will say I wonder how that compares to any argument for the US to compensate black people over laws that prevented many from prospering or whether the US should pay reparations for such an event. We have given compensation to other minorities affected the US. Only thing I can see being argued for the slavery thing is that it wasn't necessarily the US.

There wasn't anything legally binding people from owning black people in America, so would that family be held responsible to previously legal actions?

Also I said should not can just to get your both logical and/or emotional opinion. Also feel free to argue about this. 

&gt;!My opinion is a yes. I think you are due some percentage of assets. I'll probably search up if this has ever happened and what the ruling was. I think it could be scary tho. It would make a lot of people scared of getting sued in case DNA records showed their family owned slaves and that success of owning slaves still impacted their assets to modern day. I will say I wonder how that compares to any argument for the US to compensate black people over laws that prevented many from prospering or whether the US should pay reparations for such an event. We have given compensation to other minorities affected the US. Only thing I can see being argued for the slavery thing is that it wasn't necessarily the US. It was a rogue government where these slaves were held or something similar.!&lt;

It upsets me because I’m on the right.  And I see so many fall for the same propaganda they accuse the left of.  I think there is a real good argument to be made from the right on things like population growth.  Or how misinformation is treated by the mainstream media when it comes to right vs left.  Or censorship.  

But instead my side rejects everything they hear from mainstream media because they do get things wrong and pundits are agenda driven, and latch on to everything the extreme opposite is saying without any of the cynicism they give to mainstream.

Firstly, the pillows are never comfortable in their own right. You'd never use a throw pillow as a sleeping pillow. They're always either too thick, too thin and flimsy, have a rough material, or have those shitty little decorative bits that jab into you when you lean on them. They're purely hedonistic display pieces.

And when you place them on the couch or loveseat, it makes less room to sit down. You can almost never lean back comfortably in a couch covered in throw pillows. Either your ass is too unstable if you're sitting on them, or they push up against your back if they're behind you. It's never good.

So to sit down, you have to move them. But to where? Another chair? But that chair, invariably, is also covered in pillows. So now you can either pile them up or throw them on the floor, neither of which are aesthetically pleasing.

Now, if there is someone with lower back issues that needs pillows to sit down with, for example, I think it's good to have a few COMFY SOFT PILLOWS on hand.

[Bill Gates says we need the following equation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaF-fq2Zn7I) to output 0; which means ONE OF People X Services x Energy x Carbon(per unit of energy) needs to be brought to 0. Not ALL of them need to be brought to 0. 

He then goes through the first 3, saying that it isn't feasible or reasonable to bring People, Services, or Energy to 0, and instead the correct solution is to try to bring Carbon produced per Unit of energy to 0. And then spends the rest of the talk talking about how other forms of low-carbon-producing energy sources. 

To re-iterate; it is NOT THE CASE that Bill Gates is saying (at least in this talk) that we should bring down the population size; only that it's not feasible to bring down population for the purposes of this equation. It's an infeasible option he briefly goes over as he walks through an entirely separate argument about the best place to invest energy towards reducing CO2 emissions. 

Destiny was granting that ""sure maybe he wants to reduce the population with birth control"" which is... not a huge concession but still not understanding the point he was making.

850,Destiny,"I know this guy since we were like 4 years old. We're very close. We used to hang out a lot, travel together and share memes all day. He was very progressive and open minded.

Last year, he went through hell. Lost his job, separated from his wife, totalled his car, accumulated lots of debt among other stuff. He moved back with his parents and would rarely leave the house. If you ask me, most of these bad things are consequences of his own stupid actions.

Regardless, me and his other friends have been trying to reconnect with him and try to cheer him up since he is obviously depressed. We went out to chill one day and he just randomly started talking about politics, saying the most insane shit. He said things like:

- Elon Musk has exposed the truth with the Hunter Biden leaks
- COVID was made in the US. The truth will be revealed soon
- There's a new world order. There are things that you cannot say. You guys don't even know (?)

I told him that he has been spending too much time on the Internet reading conspiracy theories. He said ""Don't worry, I have done my research"". I thought he was meming but he had this 100% dead serious look on his face.

He's also been espousing some really hateful homophobic views and twitter bullshit. The other day I got into an argument with him over Andrew Tate who he was defending for some reason.

I'm genuinely concerned for the guy but I honestly cannot stand him anymore. It's really sad to see a close friend destroy himself so methodically and not being able to stop him. I don't know if there is anything I can do to help him. He was posting in his private ig story about offing himself and I had to call him and calm him down. He's not well mentally or financially.

The funny thing is he's not even American! None of this political shit affects him personally yet it has taken over his brain and he won't stop talking about it. He used to be a very progressive guy but this is what happens when you go down the wrong rabbit hole I guess. Is it too much time on Youtube watching redpill shit? It's scary how it can change you. Is there any hope for him?

861,Destiny,"As the title says, using autism as an insult is damaging the autistic community. This is not only a problem that only exists in Destiny's community, but it has become a popular insult in many online and gaming communities in general, particularly common in immature and toxic ones, in my opinion. I don’t see this issue too much outside of the online/gaming community, it happens, but it's definitely much more common and emphasized here, and kept alive by many content creators.

Using autism as an insult perpetuates the myth that autism is a bad thing and something to be ashamed of. We already face so many other problems in the autistic community, like difficulty socializing, sensory-issues, communicating, having our voices heard, fighting against public institutions that is basically the autistic equivalent of gay conversion therapy (ABA Therapy), institutions that are trying to find a cure for us, or detect autism early in the womb, in order to prevent our existence entirely, and so on, and so on.

Most of us on the spectrum, have adopted so-called ""autistic masking"" behavior, which involves suppressing behaviors that are associated with autism, such as eye contact, or engaging in social behaviors that do not come naturally to us, in order to blend in. Masking can be very challenging and exhausting, and often has very negative consequences for our mental health and well-being. Some people may mask in order to avoid discrimination, stigma, or bullying, while others many do it in an attempt to be seen as ""normal"" or to avoid standing out. We might even become really good at masking to the point where you would never be able to tell, but in the end, we're just going to end up doing more damage to our mental health as a result, often developing depression, depersonalization, anxiety, burnout, and many other issues. The suicide rate among autistic adults is unfortunately much higher than the general population. Studies have found that the suicide rate among autistic individuals may be as high as 9 times higher than the general population (varies depending on the study), and up towards 10% of the general population who died by suicide, were likely autistic, but undiagnosed.

Personally, I was diagnosed in my late 20's, being un-diagnosed and masking for so long, fucked me up in many ways. I had no explanation or guidance for managing life, developing anxiety and avoidant behavior, that I am still working on resoling to this day, and probably for a long time to come. Un-masking is a long, painful and difficult journey for us, but is ultimately the most and only permanent and effective solution for our mental health problems. 

Calling people autistic as an insult, wherever or not they're autistic, generates stigma towards autism, and contributes to the unnecessary shame that is felt in the autistic community. Are we even allowed to feel proud, being autistic? Of course, and we need your support!

It is important to be mindful of the language we use and to be respectful of others, regardless of whether they have a disability or not. Using autism or any other disability as an insult should never be acceptable. Please stop this cringe and harmful behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a few examples from Destiny, to a much more frequent issue, that I have noticed:

Example 1: [https://youtu.be/AwbyLNdpXNk?t=982](https://youtu.be/AwbyLNdpXNk?t=982) 

&gt;**Chat**: *""Destiny the N word drama was because Denims wanted an out from the drama of \*\*\*\*ing on your bed""* **Destiny**: *""True! Of breaking into my house, letting someone else in, and fucking all over my bed for a day and a half, like* ***the autistic fucking dipshit she was.***

Example 2: [https://youtube.com/watch?v=ePuRJzXT30Y&amp;t=189](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ePuRJzXT30Y&amp;t=189)  

&gt;**Destiny**: *Oh shit; ""I have an autistic 14 year old"" -* ***Oh I just read these as an insult.***

Destiny has previously addressed a his views of using autism as an insult in the following video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FT9ycFd9do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FT9ycFd9do) 

This video is 5 years old and I don't think it should be taken too seriously or relevant to his current position, whatever that might be, but nonetheless I think it would be interesting addressing a few take-away's from this video:

&gt;**12:00:** *""It's not the best defense, but when you're in a community that talk a certain way, and use a certain type of insult, it seems like the only way to communicate with them, is to use their language to some extent"".*  
&gt;  
&gt;**12:30:** *""These types of insults (referring to more descriptive adjectives) do not really work, because if you're not communicating with them with the vernacular they use and understand as insults, you kind of have no impact, you know, it's really difficult to find that line.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;**16:23**: *""If there were better words to reach for that had the same impact on your audience and the people in-game and yourself, I mean, I would switch out in a heartbeat. Do you have a good solution?* **Guest***: baby-brains? \*Destiny starts laughing\**

There's several other points that could be highlighted as well, even in defense of Destiny, but overall I don't think he was trying to look for excuses too much or anything like that, but I do think his opinions were extremely bad, and why they don't hold up, especially today:

* Using insults that contributes towards a harmful experience for people with a disability, just so you can better fit into a community or argue a point, is damaging the disabled community purely for your own benefit.
* What or who is this ""community"" or people he's trying to adhere to? His own? Destiny talked a lot about audience capture, and how he is afraid of a feedback loop, telling his fans what they want to hear. I hope he would re-visit this topic, because it's important to me.

Even Sneako which has the most consistent shit-takes in my opinion, seemed to have a more respectful (however stereotypical) take on autism that Destiny did, in this clip: [https://youtu.be/vbpv5eCP0Q4?t=689](https://youtu.be/vbpv5eCP0Q4?t=689)

&gt;**Sneako**: *Hey chat, if Destiny is a high-functioning autist, how many of you think I'm a high-functioning retard?*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Destiny**: *What's the difference? \*Giggles\**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Sneako**: *Autist people are smart! \*Straight face\**

I do acknowledge this comment from Destiny was most likely just intended as a joke or at best, his attempt at bad humor, but even if that's the case, it's still a bad joke with real consequences, indicating this is appropriate behavior to his audience.

I am a two-year lurker, but someone who's very invested in the political sphere.

I, like many others, was very invested in the current politics going on's in the U.S., and my primary source of information, and commentary, was Destiny. But as you all know the focus of Destiny's content for nearly five months has been uninteresting drama and red/blue pill relationship discussions. The only notable exceptions to this are the occasional Ukraine conflict discussion and Nick Fuentes debates.

Why is this bad?

Besides my disdain for the repetitive and non-intellectually challenging ""debates"" on red pill dating. 

**DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY FUCKING IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON POLITICALLY IN THE U.S. RIGHT NOW???**

If a conservative were to try to debate me right now about current political events, I would be fucking clueless, and I'm sure the same is true for the vast majority of you. 

If you are the type to spend hours a day on Twitter and then hours a day formulating well-researched opinions, then this is no big deal.

But the reality is that only 2% of you will ever do that. And that is why Destiny is so important. 

Destiny had hundreds of thousands of politically engaged and motivated viewers at one point in time, and I don't know if that is true anymore.

I am a two-year lurker, but someone who's very invested in the political sphere.

I, like many others, was very invested in the current politics going on's in the U.S., and my primary source of information, and commentary, was Destiny. But as you all know the focus of Destiny's content for nearly five months has been uninteresting drama and red/blue pill relationship discussions. The only notable exceptions to this are the occasional Ukraine conflict discussion and Nick Fuentes debates.

Why is this bad?

Besides my disdain for the repetitive and non-intellectually challenging ""debates"" on red pill dating. 

**DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY FUCKING IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON POLITICALLY IN THE U.S. RIGHT NOW???**

If a conservative were to try to debate me right now about current political events, I would be fucking clueless, and I'm sure the same is true for the vast majority of you. 

If you are the type to spend hours a day on Twitter and then hours a day formulating well-researched opinions, then this is no big deal.

But the reality is that only 2% of you will ever do that. And that is why Destiny is so important. 

Destiny had hundreds of thousands of politically engaged and motivated viewers at one point in time, and I don't know if that is true anymore. 

Thank you."

945,Destiny,"This post is mainly about the current rape accusations against Kai Cenat's friend (Sack), but not limited to them.

After reading about the situation, I didn't know why Kai's involvement was the most talked about. I'm not defending him; there are things he did that were wrong, but that doesn't justify crucifying him.

Things that Kai did wrong that are confirmed:

Delay the victim. He could've taken things to his legal team very quickly, and then his legal team could've helped her file a case against the accused rapist. Instead, he waited for days. I know he said he was muted, but still, I'm sure his legal team wouldn't have stopped him from saying that everything was going to be alright and that she would get the justice that she deserved.

The Stream. A lot of people, including Destiny, criticized the way he went about it and his approach. Since I watch his streams from time to time, I know that's how he speaks. He can't articulate himself well; he can't even say a sentence without saying ""you know"" four times or repeating a filler word for two minutes. Mind you, he's a 21-year-old from the worst and poorest county in New York with a high school education.

**Tldr:**  When I went to xQc's stream to see what they thought about Kai's situation (wrong place, IK), that chat was acting as if Kai was the rapist, everyone jumping down his neck, and xQc would give a little push back because the chat was being unreasonable and would get flamed himself, so he let the chat go even crazier, and the same was for HassanAbi, but it was even worse.

But Destiny actually pushed back on every single point and gave his reasoning behind it, and he didn't let chat go on with their crazy assumptions. Before watching Destiny's stream, I was doubting everything. I'm glad there's a blue haired genius on YouTube I can rely on for critical thinking and not a bandwagoner, dick riding, agenda pushing, spineless piece of shit.

959,Destiny,"I'm a bit late, but I really wanted to talk about that episode and give my take on it. 

I can see why someone would watch Fresh + Fit, as there is a lot of entertainment. For example, that Russian girl that was clearly on something is entertaining. However, just because it's entertaining doesn't mean it's a good thing. Watching a trainwreck is entertaining but it's nothing to write home about. And at the beginning whenever they asked the guests to ""name 3 countries"" the segment was also hilarious. But, once you take into account that most of their guests are so terminally online and obsessed with the idea of being an influencer that they will stoop to the level of actually being a guest on Fresh + Fit for clout is kind of sad. 

I also really like it when Myron &amp; Destiny debate each other as there is nothing particularly toxic and is genuinely interesting. I disagree with Myron but I can totally understand some of his viewpoints and why he comes to that conclusion. If I didn't listen to Destiny I can see myself kind of falling for what he says. Sad but true. 

However, I can't really say the same about his co-host. That ""College women are getting flown out to Dubai"" take is utterly ridiculous. My jaw dropped to the floor when I heard that. It's such a terminally online take. I would probably say the same if I just used Instagram all day and didn't go outside. I've tried to think of an excuse for why he would say that and I just can't. I wouldn't even say that there is a portion of women in general that get flown to Dubai. To me, it seemed like that guy thinks saying stuff like that would make him feel better whenever he has troubles with other women. I don't know, perhaps I'm overreading? 

And who could forget Sneako! Why is it that almost every time I watch something related to Sneako that he says almost nothing the entire time and contributes very little to the conversation? It's like he's just there to occasionally do a ""funny,"" and that's it. By the way, Sneako copying Tates mannerisms and pose is so puerile; you can't help but laugh. It reminds me of when I was 13 years old and I would act like Rambo and try to be a badass. I'd be mostly silent and have a tough look while sometimes saying oneliners like ""Live for nothing, or die for something."" When you're young, that's kind of cool. But when you're an adult, it's kind of pathetic.

Women aren't impressed by the amount of woman a guy sleeps with. Most find it gross.

But men are impressed. They think you're the shit if you can fuck (not date) multiple women. You're ""the man"" if you have 4 chick's around your arm. They take it as a challenge. They're either going to try steal your girl or try fuck more women than you. That's 'the game' 


Women aren't impressed by fast cars. In fact if redpill ideology is to be believed that women only care about resources. They'd want an SUV. They'd want something that can take more than 2 grocery bags. They'd want something they can pick their kids up from school with. Something that didn't cost a down payment on a house.

But men are impressed. They love the zoomie zoomie vroom vroom. They like the speed. They like that it costs the equivalent of 50 years of someone's rent. They want the fastest most expensive car, because other men can't.


Women aren't really impressed by physique. It's important for sure. but they care more about you looking after yourself than the muscle tone. A lot of women say ""I want a man whose fit but not like fit fit. Ya know?""

But men are impressed. The joke goes 'when you start working out, it's not women who compliment you more, it's other men.' They're impressed by strength and the sculpting of muscle. They want to be the strongest and the best looking.


Women are impressed by a guy who can share his emotions. Someone who can open up and be vulnerable in intimate moments. Someone who shares what they think, their dreams and their fears. 

But men aren't impressed. The more emotion you show, they weaker you seem. The less in control you are. Men take it as a badge of honor that they don't cry. It's gay, or womanly to talk about how you feel. They value logic and reason and faaaaacts. They want to be the most rational. To be in charge




In summary, the Redpill community is a way to connect with other men. An unhealthy connection based in competition and one uping. It's a race to the bottom to see who gets their first. Focusing on material wealth and surface level self worth.
