This girl I knew from high-school was born into a very prude and conservative family. She was self-conscious about her body and craved attention from guys. She has an onlyfans now and I feel like it fills the ""emptiness"" that she felt from the lack of attention of guys. 

To be clear, she's conventionally attractive and she is sexy at least for me. As in, I don't think the lack of attention had to do with her physical appearance but rather because she didn't go out or she dressed like a church leader. 

Now my potential worry is that she might be doing the onlyfans because the attention she gets from horny teenagers is affirming rather than because she is particularly sex positive or likes to show herself off.

In a hypothetical future, she no longer feels self-conscious and turns out, she doesn't actually enjoy adult content creation. So she decides to stop and move on to something else.

&gt; Dems need a miracle now.

It has not been called, but based on the ballot counts in the final competitive races, Democrats look to be falling short.

Given how narrow the majorities are, almost any factor was decisive in this result; If New York's Democratic Party hadn't fumbled so badly, if the DCCC had targeted key races a little bit better, if fewer Democratic incumbents had retired in key seats, if Donors had sent more money to critical swing races, rather than blown it on unwinnable races against MTG or on the doomed Florida Democrats. If the Saudis hadn't cut production numbers of oil right before the midterm, sending gas prices up. If youth turnout had been more like 2018, etc. 

But while being so close, is of course aggravating, Democrats did avoid disaster, that is typical of Midterms. And now Republicans will have to govern an incredibly narrow House majority. They also have internal recriminations as they blew a bunch of winnable races with freaks and cranks. Their crazies are already issuing demands, and McCarthy doesn't have the votes to just ignore them.

House conservatives are effectively demanding the Speaker be rendered near powerless, and that bipartisan dealings be halted altogether. And McCarthy still needs their votes to be made Speaker but doesn't want to hobble himself. And if he does submit to their rules, he is going to find it incredibly hard to do budgets, needing a majority of the majority.

Also electing Committee chairs sounds like a recipe for making MTG the head of a committee.

But while the radicals are issuing demands, Republican moderates don't want to be part of the votes that make MTG the head of a powerful committee. So it's going to be knives out.

Republicans are going to be in a mess. And their majority is so narrow, that Democrats will almost certainly be able to push through key things like Ukraine aid via a [Discharge petition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_petition). And there is a very real possibility, that Democrats could lend their votes to elect a moderate Speaker. Or depending on the House rules, we could get multiple Speakers, just based on who can get 218 votes at any one time, so the Speaker could flip around a lot.

While new sweeping legislation is dead, Biden and the Democrats are going to have a chaotic Republican House as a foil. 

**The Senate**

As called, earlier Democrats have the Senate. With Arizona and Nevada secured they have 50 seats. Warnock of course needs to win his runoff in Georgia, which will boost their numbers up to 51.

In total, Republicans had a terrible run of Governor races. They had a wide slate of races where they thought they had a chance to make pickups. They thought they would make multiple pickups, and hold ground. Instead

1. They blew races in key swing states with elections deniers, losing in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. 
2. They fell short in their shots in New York and Oregon, though they ended up being close, and down-ballot the close races helped them pick up House seats.
3. They got blown out in Maine, running former Republican Governor against the incumbent Democrat.
4. They got blown out in Colorado.
5. They flopped against moderate Democrat Laura Kelly in Kansas, despite this being a very Republican state.
6. They gave away Maryland and Massachusetts, both governed previously by moderate Republicans by nominating extremists, letting Democrats get easy trifectas. 
7. And now they look set to lose Arizona, a key swing state.

Their only victory was narrowly gaining Nevada with Joe Lombardo, a popular Clark County sheriff. This is a loss, but he doesn't seem to be a MAGA extremist, and given Nevada, the Democratic Governor was likely cooked as soon as he shut down the state for covid, given how important Tourism and gambling is to their state. [And he will be put in check by a Democratic State Legislature, which might in 2024 expand to a Supermajority in both chambers.](https://twitter.com/ChazNuttycombe/status/1592171052183977984)

Over the entire course of Biden's Presidency so far, Democrats have lost 2 Governors, Virginia and Nevada and picked up 3, Maryland, Massachusetts and Arizona. 

[A far cry from 2010 when Democrats lost 11 Governors in 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_gubernatorial_elections), and in [2009 had also lost New Jersey and Virginia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_United_States_gubernatorial_elections) 

[Or 2014, where Democrats lost 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_United_States_gubernatorial_elections). 


In terms of State Legislatures, Democrats lost no state legislatures, which hasn't happened in a midterm with an incumbent party since the 1930s during the New Deal. Additionally, they picked up

* The Minnesota State Senate, completing their trifecta which they last held in 2014.
* Both the Michigan State House and Senate, grabbing a trifecta for the first time in over 40 years.
* In Alaska Democrats, Independents and moderate Republicans might set up a majority coalition in their state legislature.
* [The PA State House is coming down to a recount and might flip Democratic narrowly.](https://twitter.com/ChazNuttycombe/status/1592009187978100736)
* [Recounts are also in progress in New Hampshire, which would flip the New Hampshire House, Democratic.](https://twitter.com/Taniel/status/1592170675141500928)

With the federal level getting locked up by a Republican House, progress for the next two years will rely mostly on remaining executive action, judges or Democratic State Legislatures. And the good news.

Here is the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xVfILXpJEE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xVfILXpJEE)

Skip to 11:00. Eventually he says, ""If you look at the median income of white earners and black earners, there is a gap but it is not even close to what the gap is of what we're looking at."" From this, he insinuates that the wage gap that the public is concerned with is some wage gap primarily affected by the top 20%. 

He is being really weaselly with words here. He makes it seem as though that we aren't looking at the median wage gap and that our data is primarily skewed by the top 20%.

When people discuss the racial wage gap, is it fair to agree that we are generally speaking about the statistics provided by the Department of Labor or a similar U.S. entity?

[https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/about/data/earnings/race-and-ethnicity](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/about/data/earnings/race-and-ethnicity)

The Department of Labor says that black people make $0.76 for every white person's $1. But is that greatly skewed by the top 20%?

Pewresearch indicates that the bottom 10% of white people make 2x more than the bottom 10% of black people. Pewresearch indicates that middle class white people make about 50% more than middle class black people. According to statista, 2021 MEDIAN incomes report that white people make a MEDIAN of 78k and black people make a MEDIAN of 48k. That is white people making about 50% more than black people based on MEDIAN income data. It matters little how many white billionaires there are to black billionaires when looking at median income, as we know. This is because 1 white man making 1 trillion dollars annually would not change a median income result if that same white man made 1 million dollars annually (granted that the median income is below 1 million). 

But how does this compare to the DoL findings above? Well, 1/0.76 = 0.32. This shows that according to the DoL data's AVERAGES, white people make 31% more than black people. According to MEDIANS, as shown above, white people make around 50% more in the middle class range, and 100% more in the poverty range. This means that, the OPPOSITE OF WHAT SAAGAR WAS IMPLYING IS TRUE. As you go LOWER in income, the wage gap INCREASES. Maybe there is some exception when one's analysis gets to incomes above 500k or so, but for people working everyday jobs, the wage gap is MORE SEVERE as you look at lower socioeconomic backgrounds.

I hope other leftists don't get misled by Saagar's sneaky words. He, in fact, tried to cite a ""socialist"" when making this really bad point.",Racial Wage Gap: Calling out Saagar Enjeti on Breaking Points for Spewing False Information (Once Again),1668386817,"Racial Wage Gap: Calling out Saagar Enjeti on Breaking Points for Spewing False Information (Once Again) People need to call out Saagar and other republicans on their false facts.

The reason why i post this, is hopefully for Vaush to see as it highlights the level of ideocracy in these people. As i a humble idiot on the internet could find this mans ""criminal"" past.

This 63 year old man, had walked into a Travel Lodge (A UK chain of budget hotels) with no pants on. Thats it!

 For this he was placed upon the Sex offenders register, it to me screams dementia or mental health. With teh article actually stating their was ""no sexual motive"" in this offence. The ONLY other offence i could find of his was he destroyed a Poppy remembrance display. Still not very nice, but a far cry from the way people are framing this man. Saying things like ""well if you have sex with children what do you expect"" or ""if you rape a woman this should happen"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Its utterly vile, besides that its wrong and just low IQ, i hate it.  These fools are quick to castrate an individual but can not do a quick google search to check his convicted crimes, its a very steep cultural decline. We have all the tools at our fingers to just look, but people cant even do that. 

Mad stuff.

150,VaushV,"Okay, so to start with, I'm not making this post to prove any great point. I was just reminded of this, and it's a pretty funny anecdote that I thought some people might appreciate. You will not learn anything about deradicalization here, all of the owns were self-owns, and this happened more than a decade ago so my memory may not be spot on. Treat this as short fiction, I guess is what I'm saying.

Okay, so I worked as a painter. Houses, not paintings. At the time, there was a boom going on (it would have been about 2006, in a rapidly expanding urban center) and we were desperately struggling to keep up with multiple projects in a business where people fired for incompetence could literally walk next door and be back to work within the hour. I worked as a foreman for the relatively unskilled part of the crew, and part of my job was that I worked with any new hires to make sure they weren't completely useless before they were sent anywhere by themselves.

So, my boss comes to me in the morning, tells me what site I'm going to, and then tells me he has a new guy to help me. We're barely keeping up to the schedule, and just lost a guy who was stabbed because his brother was involved in a gang. And then he tells me ""Hey, I need you not to start anything. This guy is a white supremacist, but we need another guy or we're not going to finish. Just try to keep it professional."" And, since my ability to eat and pay rent was ultimately dependent upon us keeping up to those deadlines, I agreed.

The guy was exactly what a white supremacist in a movie made by white supremacists looks like. Gym rat with a shaved head, a legit swastika tattoo, just straight out of central casting. The guy was 6'4"". I know, because he told me during coffee break. I don't remember all of the figures he shared with me - his weight, how much he could bench press, his IQ, and at one point his shoe size. He was very proud of these metrics, and was quite happy to hold up the conversation single-handed while I bit back the desperate need to say ""Wow, that's almost as big as Micheal Jordan"" to see what he did.

By coffee break, of course, we had been working for 2 hours already. I had sent him up to work on the windows above the sub-roofs. It's a good test of a new guy, since you have to set up fall protection for each sub-roof, and the safety guy polices that so I don't have to check on the guy myself - as noted, we were behind, so I wanted to get some work done myself. It's a pretty big job, so I was impressed when he told me he was nearly done. Not as impressed as I was by his ability to provide detailed metrics for his own athletic performance, but at least the guy could paint. So, I gave him some ladder work to do out back.

Not ten minutes later, he comes back. ""I need to go. I hurt my leg."" He's standing there. Well, the guy already got a lot done for the two hours he was here, and it's not like I can stop him from leaving. Nor would I try. Still, I was curious. 

""What happened?""

""I fell off my ladder.""

""Oh, shit, are you okay? You'd better report that to safety.""

""I fell off the second rung. I banged my knee.""

""And you can't work?""

""I need to get it checked out.""

""Well, okay then.""

And so he left. I went to pack up the tools he was using, which was when I discovered that he had been using the wrong paint. So, I went and checked on the windows he'd painted. And yep, wrong paint there. Not that it mattered, since the reason he'd finished so quickly appeared to be that he'd just rolled all the faces and done none of the brushwork. For the entire day, the guy had done literally nothing. Less than nothing, since I had to clean up his tools.

My boss gave him another chance.

I guess the takeaway from this, if there is one, should be that underneath all the politics and the violence and the ideology, these people really are deeply pathetic losers.",The time I worked with a white supremacist for a day.,1668280913,"The time I worked with a white supremacist for a day. Okay, so to start with, I'm not making this post to prove any great point. I was just reminded of this, and it's a pretty funny anecdote that I thought some people might appreciate. You will not learn anything about deradicalization here, all of the owns were self-owns, and this happened more than a decade ago so my memory may not be spot on. Treat this as short fiction, I guess is what I'm saying.

Okay, so I worked as a painter. Houses, not paintings. At the time, there was a boom going on (it would have been about 2006, in a rapidly expanding urban center) and we were desperately struggling to keep up with multiple projects in a business where people fired for incompetence could literally walk next door and be back to work within the hour. I worked as a foreman for the relatively unskilled part of the crew, and part of my job was that I worked with any new hires to make sure they weren't completely useless before they were sent anywhere by themselves.

So, my boss comes to me in the morning, tells me what site I'm going to, and then tells me he has a new guy to help me. We're barely keeping up to the schedule, and just lost a guy who was stabbed because his brother was involved in a gang. And then he tells me ""Hey, I need you not to start anything. This guy is a white supremacist, but we need another guy or we're not going to finish. Just try to keep it professional."" And, since my ability to eat and pay rent was ultimately dependent upon us keeping up to those deadlines, I agreed.

The guy was exactly what a white supremacist in a movie made by white supremacists looks like. Gym rat with a shaved head, a legit swastika tattoo, just straight out of central casting. The guy was 6'4"". I know, because he told me during coffee break. I don't remember all of the figures he shared with me - his weight, how much he could bench press, his IQ, and at one point his shoe size. He was very proud of these metrics, and was quite happy to hold up the conversation single-handed while I bit back the desperate need to say ""Wow, that's almost as big as Micheal Jordan"" to see what he did.

By coffee break, of course, we had been working for 2 hours already. I had sent him up to work on the windows above the sub-roofs. It's a good test of a new guy, since you have to set up fall protection for each sub-roof, and the safety guy polices that so I don't have to check on the guy myself - as noted, we were behind, so I wanted to get some work done myself. It's a pretty big job, so I was impressed when he told me he was nearly done. Not as impressed as I was by his ability to provide detailed metrics for his own athletic performance, but at least the guy could paint. So, I gave him some ladder work to do out back.

Not ten minutes later, he comes back. ""I need to go. I hurt my leg."" He's standing there. Well, the guy already got a lot done for the two hours he was here, and it's not like I can stop him from leaving. Nor would I try. Still, I was curious. 

""What happened?""

""I fell off my ladder.""

""Oh, shit, are you okay? You'd better report that to safety.""

""I fell off the second rung. I banged my knee.""

""And you can't work?""

""I need to get it checked out.""

""Well, okay then.""

And so he left. I went to pack up the tools he was using, which was when I discovered that he had been using the wrong paint. So, I went and checked on the windows he'd painted. And yep, wrong paint there. Not that it mattered, since the reason he'd finished so quickly appeared to be that he'd just rolled all the faces and done none of the brushwork. For the entire day, the guy had done literally nothing. Less than nothing, since I had to clean up his tools.

My boss gave him another chance. It ended with our rented boom lift leaking hydraulic fluid all over the road (I honestly don't know how that could have been his fault, but it feels like maybe he's just karmically a screw-up.) He got nothing done that day either. When he showed up to pick up his check, it was with his posse, led by his brother - a slightly larger, slightly beefier clone of him.

The following exchanges are only slightly abridged and simplified, but the overall intent and flow of discourse is maintained to the best of my ability. I know these sound like totally made up conversations, parodies of conservatives. Blatant straw-men meant to make my position sound good against things so outlandish that no one actually believes them. But I assure you these are actual conversations that happened within days/weeks of each other. I only wish I made them up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCUSSION 1 (with a ""moderate conservative""):**

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** I love DeSantis. I hope he's our next President.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Isn't it at least a little bit concerning that he refused to disown or disavow literal Nazis who flew Nazi and SS flags alongside a DeSantis flag in his own state?

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** Why should he have to say anything about it?

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Why should a politician have to say that he doesn't support literal Nazis? There was kind of a war about it. Most of the world joined in. You'd think this would be the easiest slam dunk in the world. ""Nazis are bad."" So why wouldn't he say Nazis are bad and he doesn't support them or want their endorsement? Either he agrees with them, or he knows disowning or disavowing them would cost him votes from Nazis or Nazi sympathizers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** It's just a few people. Politicians don't like to be in the news or surrounded in controversy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Ron DeSantis doesn't like to be in the news or to be at the center of controversy? All he does is engage in controversial culture war issues, and he's clearly building his brand for a 2024 Presidential Run.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** Nazis aren't a real problem today. How many Nazis and white supremacists do you actually think there are in the US?

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Enough are in law enforcement that the FBI have been saying it's a problem for well over a decade now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** I don't know man, I just don't think it's that big of a deal, so he doesn't need to say anything. You're making a big deal about nothing. The economy is much more important than a few Nazis. The craziness the liberals are teaching in schools is more important and more dangerous than a few Nazis.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCUSSION 2 (with an ""independent"" who voted  for DeSantis):**

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** Why do you think there wasn't the red wave that was predicted?

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Lots of young voters voted blue. A lot of people are worried about the rise of the Evangelical Right and Christian Nationalism, so that's probably part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** The Republicans have always been like that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** That's a little concerning, no? Wanting theocratic law, to deprive groups of people of basic human rights in the name of religion? That so many people support something that you admit is this way and always has been this way is not good, right?

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** Well, I think the economy was more important to a lot of voters. Things like abortion and LGBT rights only impact a small percent of people while the economy impacts everyone (note: Coworker was one of these voters).

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** How far are you willing to take this? What percent of people would you have to strip of human rights in exchange for promises to improve the economy, and how heinous would the deprivation of rights have to be before you said ""no, that's too far. I can't vote for you.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** Everyone sets the line somewhere different. I can't say what's right or wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Sure. But there has to be some line at which we can agree is too far, even if it's only a small portion of the people whose rights are being stripped away, and even if we have to use a really extreme example to say ""that's clearly over the line."" There's more LGBT people than Jewish people in the US. Would you say it's morally justifiable to support a Nazi candidate who promises to fix the economy but only if they commit a genocide on all the Jewish people in America? Or put all the Jewish people in ghettos?

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** No one is trying to kill the Jews in America. Come on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** It's a thought exercise. I'm trying to see if you'll acknowledge that the most obvious example of going too far is, in fact, going too far.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** It's their opinion. In their opinion, it's right. If that's what the people vote for, it's what they think is right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** So if the majority of people want something, anything, it must inherently be the right thing, and should be done?

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** Yes. I may think it's a bad or wrong thing, but that's how America works. We do what the people vote for and what the politicians we elect pass into law.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** So Nazi Germany was right? The Holocaust was right? You can say that Germany THOUGHT it was right at the time, but we can now say that it was, in fact, WRONG to genocide millions of people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** That's your opinion. I of course also think it's wrong, but every person and culture thinks different things are right and wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** So slavery wasn't wrong, because people thought it was right at the time? Well, at least the slave owners thought it was right. I'm pretty sure the slaves didn't think it was right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** Of course I think it was bad. But slavery was ok at the time, so it was right at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** They thought it was ok at the time, but we can look back and say it was wrong to own humans and rape slaves.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** But it was legal at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Legal doesn't always mean right. America was kind of founded on a revolution resulting from not wanting to follow unjust and tyrannical laws. We fought a war over it and everything.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** Not really, but whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Anyway, I think anyone who wants to deprive entire groups of people of basic human rights on the grounds of their religious beliefs is doing something bad.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** That's just your opinion. You have to respect other peoples' opinions. You just want everyone to think the way you do.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** No, I don't care what anyone thinks or how anyone lives. I only care when they try to tell other people that they have to live the way they want.

&amp;#x200B;

**Note:** There was a tangent about the paradox of tolerance here, after explaining what that means, but coworker said we should only talk about politics, not philosophy, so that went nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** I don't really see the difference. But you have to respect other peoples' opinions. Murder, rape, and slavery being wrong are just your opinions. Being a Nazi or pro-slavery are wrong to you, but that's just your opinion. Some people think they're good things. I of course think they're really bad, but that's just my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** And some people are wrong, and some people are actually bad people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** You can't say someone is a bad person for having a different opinion than you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** If their opinion is that there should be another Holocaust, or that we should bring back slavery, or that LGBT people should have basic rights taken away based on religious beliefs, I most certainly can. And if they act on these opinions, and try to enforce them as laws, I absolutely can.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** What Constitutional rights do Republicans want to take away from LGBT people? Marriage isn't a Constitutional right, and gays only recently got that right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** Being allowed to drive also isn't a constitutional right. Does that mean it's not bad to pass a law that says gay people aren't allowed to drive?

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** That's silly. Nobody wants to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** I never said people did. But it logically follows your claim that it's not bad to take away non-constitutionally granted rights from groups of people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** If that's what the people vote for, it's what the people want. That's how America works. I may think it's wrong, but that's just my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me:** I think it's wrong to deprive people of rights based on religious beliefs, even if the majority of people want to do it. You're arguing that might inherently makes right. That anything the majority of people vote for is right. That anything that is legal is right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coworker:** You just have to respect other peoples' opinions. No one is a bad person for having a different opinion than you.

The situation in Florida is not that surprising when you factor in covid and how weak the state Dem party has been. it's been pretty red for awhile but DeSantis just put the final touches on it

Texas has the Florida problem, but the Dems are actually keeping some areas competitive as far as i know(although I haven't looked at the rest of the races yet)

The most baffling thing I've seen so far is the vote splitting in states like WI and GA. Georgia I know looks to be along racial lines but still it's mind boggling there's people smart enough to vote for Warnock and Evers, but also choosing Kemp and Ron fucking Johnson. 

Red state Dems should model after Tim Ryan, lost but ran a good campaign that drove turnout

Some thing also to remember is that even though certain statewide candidates lost, they still drove turnout downballot. Abrams and even Beto are good for that.

**strategy going forward**

Pennsylvania and Michigan state parties should advise other state parties, they've done a phenomenal job in rebuilding their infrastructure and gaining back legislative power.

So, we‚Äôve bought time,  we‚Äôre not going to be completely fucked before 2024. Now of course, is not the time to relax, for there is still much work to be done to save or at least salvage Democracy in America. The MAGA movement is still strong, even if Donald Trump has been moved aside as the leader. DeSantis perhaps is more of a threat than Donald Trump may ever have. He is largely in favor of the same points trump is, but without as much foulmouthed blatancy to his agenda. So, what is to be done? With Harper v Moore on the horizon, and runoffs still in play, now is the time for great action to be taken to contain and chip away at the MAGA movements popularity. How best to go about this? Well, we can‚Äôt do it alone that‚Äôs for sure.

Forgive me for sounding LARP-y, but the answer is a United Front of all movements opposed to the growing Pseudo-Fascist sentiments which have all but subsumed the Republican Party. This United Front must be composed of ALL Movements opposed to MAGA-ism, be they Left, Right, or even Centrist. Anyone, from Antifa to Forward, and from there to those Libertarian Parties not taken over by fascists in disguise. We can‚Äôt let Democracy fall because we are too busy criticizing the Democrats for not going far-enough to protect Workers Rights and defend democracy. If this is truly the endgame, anyone and everyone who recognizes MAGA-ism for what it truly is must be united under a single movement to oppose it, even if it means working with those who are against certain things we support.

If they are not against us, they are for us. If they are against Trump and DeSantis, they are for us. Democrats, RINOs, Antifa, Bernie Bros, Yang Gangers, Libertarians, Greens, all must stand together as one if we are to truly form an effective defense against Fascism in our country. The time for our bickering is over and the time for unified action is here. Even if the alliance is temporary, the costs of not doing so are too high to not at least try.

Anyways, I typed this up in 5 minutes cause I'm not content to leave for canada and watch my Home Country become something it's not. Even if it would only be temporary. ""Temporary"" Can be for a long time, Fascism is surprisingly malleable and more resillient than we give it credit for, (See: Francoist Spain).

429,VaushV,"In March 2021 it was reported that progressives took over control of a large part of the Nevada Democratic party. On the gubernatoral and senate level, the Democrats currently don't look that good.

So I was interested in looking up how they are doing in local races.

&amp;#x200B;

The Nevada assembly (similar to the House of Representatives) has 42 seats. Previously the Democrats held 26 seats, while Republicans held 16. The term was 2 years, so all seats were re-elected.

This appears to be the main reporting of all election results

[https://www.kunr.org/politics-and-policy/2022-11-08/2022-nevada-general-election-results-state-assembly-races](https://www.kunr.org/politics-and-policy/2022-11-08/2022-nevada-general-election-results-state-assembly-races)

Based on what I counted myself on paper Democrats are currently leading or have already won 26 seats, while Republicans currently lead or have won in 16 seats. Currently, depending on the seats counting is between 50-80% (2-3 Republicans were elected unopposed).

&amp;#x200B;

The Nevada Senate has 21 seats (4 year terms). Every 2 years, half of the Senate is re-elected. Before Dems held 11 seats and Republicans 9 (one seats remained vacant).

[https://www.kunr.org/politics-and-policy/2022-11-08/2022-nevada-general-election-results-state-senate-races](https://www.kunr.org/politics-and-policy/2022-11-08/2022-nevada-general-election-results-state-senate-races)

If I understood it correctly (and remember these aren't the full results), the Dems should hold 12 seats, while the Republicans remain on 8. The additional seat was a vacancy in Senate district 13, left by a Democrat who moved. In addition District 8 flipped to the Republicans, while Democrats are currently leading an open seat in District 12, where the Republican incumbent was limited by term-limits.

Here's a link to the article but I'm kind of mixed on the issue. The director of the game states that narratively having a diverse cast of different ethnicities would be too divisive to include in their setting of the game since it's inspired by medieval Europe.

Personally, I thought his answer was dumb because besides like 2 maybe 3 characters, Final Fantasy has been exclusively white and the black characters were either a stereotype or weren't even memorable. Any form of diversity would be in a portrayal of a monster or anthropomorphic race of people and maybe one or two of them would join the main party.

However, I do respect his teams creative freedom of how they want to portray the 6 different countries in the game.  

It also might be for the best to make the cast exclusively white because they already have a bad track record in writing compelling black characters except for Barret.",Final Fantasy 16 Diversity issue,1668009474,"Final Fantasy 16 Diversity issue  [Naoki Yoshida addresses Final Fantasy 16's lack of diversity | Eurogamer.net](https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-addresses-final-fantasy-16s-lack-of-diversity)

So far it looks like Democrats might tie in the Senate. I would prefer if that didn't happen because Nevada as of right now is still counting their ballots but hey what can you do?

The House is deathly close. I think Republicans win the House barely by at most five to six seats especially California 45, but Republicans will lose at least eight seats including New Mexico 2 flipping back and Colorado 3 aka Bobert.

Governorship so far looks like to be a net gain of +2 for Democrats.

458,VaushV,"So a good amount of the midterm results are in, and democrats had a pretty good night. But I think if there's one takeaway from them, it's not that the GOP as a party did poorly, it's that the Trump endorsement seemed to be more of a curse.

Most of the big Trump endorsed candidates in competitive underperformed, some even on the same ballot as non-Trump endorsed GOP candidates like Kemp and Walker in Georgia, with Kemp doing far better than Walker.  And then you even have hardcore Trump candidates in non-competitive districts, like Boebert, that might lose...and that's shocking honestly.

Meanwhile, DeSantis, a previous Trump-sycophant turned Trump rival, dominated his election.  I think GOP voters are going to realize that Trump or being associated with Trump is a detriment in general elections.  And this might actually make Trump lose the primary.

And IF Trump loses the primary, the GOP presidential election is lost.  The reason I say this is that Trump will never just go quietly into that good night.  He is way too much of a narcissist.  He will say the primary was stolen, he will rally his brain-dead followers to not vote for whoever won the primary, and he may even run as an independent.

The point is, he will sabotage the GOP's general for his own ego if he loses the primary.

Before we start. The independent state legislature theory succeeding is not a good thing. I want to stress this. Its possible success is not a good thing, but there might be ways to use it for a leftist cause.

These ideas and recommendations build on the assumption that Moore v Harper leads to the Supreme court supporting even more independence for state legislatures. Understanding this will likely allow many very conservative and Republican run states to gerrymander a large number of states, but it might also give more power to a few allies. If this actually happens, we need a plan for how to responsibly use this power and use it to change a larger number of minds.

I want to talk about how we could achieve voting reform in more decentralized America. Many of the suggestions aren't directly left-wing, but might allow the creation of left-wing organizations in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**My recommendations and possible tactics build on 3 types of states/areas:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Type a)**

**A standard Republican state.**

This will be the hardest area to succeed in. Republican legislatures will make it almost impossible to win an election as a democrat or leftist. The main focus has to lie on the few counties that vote for democrats. There are often somewhat independent cities.

I've looked at Lawrence, Kansas, for example. It and a few other towns form Douglas county. A county that voted 69% for Biden (less than 30% for Trump). In this county, democrats are basically guaranteed to win any race. There are probably exceptions for the more rural townships.

It seems like it is possible to achieve things like voter reform, but also the creation of political parties or at least groups that serve the same purpose as parties on the local or county level.

I want to be honest. I do not know if it is technically possible to do it, but I would guess that there mostly are no state rules on ""Can this county allow more political parties to be created, after they just introduced a voter system that allows this"".

Of my limited research, many city councils in the U.S. aren't that organized in their city government and often outsource committees. Sometimes there are very small city commissions. Try to learn how government is organized in your city. If it's possible, try to run as a democrat and signal your support for voting reform. It might be possible to introduce a form of proportional representation (If it was on me, I would favor an open-list proportional representation system, like in Denmark, instead of STV).

&amp;#x200B;

**Type b)**

**A standard Democratic state.**

Giving state legislatures more control on state-elections will also affect Democratic lead states. In these cases, we need to both get democratic candidates supporting statewide voter reform and work on referendum proposals. Most of these states are on the northern East Coast (New York, Vermont) and the West Coast (California, Washington).

Democrats could use gerrymandering to insure control over blue states, but we need to be the voice of voting reform. There need to be organized parts of the Democratic Party supporting plans for proportional representation on the local and state level. I recommend especially looking at local German state elections which use much fairer election systems than the U.S., but also exist in a system with local, county and state level. There might also be other countries that we are able to learn of.

I want to see Americans being jealous of the states that are blue today, but that might introduce electoral reform in the next 10 to 20 years. To get to that point, we need to work within the Democratic Party and maybe add the support of smaller movements (like the Working Families Party). Should a state changes to a fairer system for state legislatures, we need to make it easier to form new parties that are able to run, without taking votes away from the Democrats. When this ever happens, we need to continue smart coalitions. Even if a state allows for leftist parties being an option, these parties might still need to ally with democrats for races on local or federal levels. It is important to prevent vote splitting, but also show strenght and representation. 

While actually being right-leaning, it makes sense in my opinion to look at the Australian coalition, which unites more moderate and right-leaning parties, while insuring independence for its members. There is hopefully a point, when leftist parties that are strong in states or regions, might be able to create coalition agreements with democrats.

&amp;#x200B;

**Type C)**

**The weird states**

This category is one that is hard to define. ""Weird states"" are states that trend to not have the traditional democrats vs republicans politics. My prime example is Alaska. In the Alaska State House, Independents and Republicans caucus with the Democrats, while in the State Senate, a Democrat caucuses with the Republicans.

While Alaska is not going Democratic soon, but it still has very, very unusual politics. In 2014, Democrats teamed up with an Independent to beat the incumbent Republican. In 1990 a third party candidate won, but later joined the Republicans. Coalitions in the state are weird. Despite being heavily pro-Republican, Alaska has also implemented voter reform.

There might have to be VERY weird alliances, that might actually work for some reasons, depending on the region. If it is possible to convince moderate Republicans to form coalitions for policies that will increase the number of options represented in parliament.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I believe this is important**

These were some broad suggestions. They might be overly positive. But even in the worst case of Republicans being allowed by the Supreme Court to gerrymander, we need to talk about how to work in a new environment. There have always been and there are at this point, laws that have made our democracy more unfair. We need to see it from the political side and use the remaining tools and new tools to our favor, even if some of these tools were created against us.

&amp;#x200B;

If you aren't in direct danger, look up what you are able to do in your local area and state. There are many different ways to help. I have tried to list some, but there are many others and these suggestions might not even apply to your situation. A better world is always possible, even if the odds are against us.

And remember what we stand for. We need to start governing on our values. Our values deserve to be used for positive change.

But Democrats in most other states come out swinging and scored some serious wins.

**Florida** 

L - Florida Democrats

W - Florida Republicans

Florida is a hell mouth. A cursed land inhabited by demons. 

Florida Democrats just absolutely collapsed here. DeSantis rigged the whole state with an insane gerrymander (that because of Republicans' massive overperformance is kinda a dummymander and sort of limited how high they could have gone). Democrats got majorly outspent, [Qanon and other insanity has taken over Florida Latin American emigree communities](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/05/politics/florida-election-lies-spanish-language/index.html), just utterly bleak.

[Rubio won 57.7% to Val Demmings 41.3% at the time of this post. 
](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-florida.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=StateNavMenu)

DeSantis won 59.4% to Crist's 40% at the time of this post.

This is in a year, where the national popular vote is likely 2-3 +D after accounting for uncontested races. Florida is a red state. 

If you live in Florida, just leave. The state is a cursed land, and it's going to be underwater. Just move. Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, New Hampshire, PA, MI, WI, just any swing state. There are just too many insane right-wing Latin American exiles, too many Fox News-addled retirees, and too many hard-core conservatives leaving other states to escape 'covid' tyranny and moving to Florida. 

But the reason it is worth mentioning is it could be a major secret L for Trump. Florida Republicans are essentially the only ones who can claim to have a rock-solid victory. Led by DeSantis, who now with this victory under his belt. While Trump looming over this election can be used to claim that Trump cost them seats. This could be the start of a Republican Civil war.

**New York**

W - New York Republicans, Cuomo. 

L - New York Democrats, the House Majority possibly. 

If Republicans still win a House Majority, the fault is down to New York. [New York Judges, a conservative body made up of Cuomo appointees struck down the Democratic gerrymander, drawn to counter GOP gerrymanders in other states](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/nyregion/redistricting-congress-gerrymander-ny.html). They didn't do this out of a sincere anti-gerrymandering stance, since they allowed the previous State Senate maps to stand, which were gerrymandered in the Republicans' favour. 

New York Democrats were also either asleep at the wheel, or actively aiding the GOP. [New York Governor Kathy Hochul,, at the time of this post, is only winning by a bit over 5 points, in New York, against a pro-insurrectionist former House member.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-new-york.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=StateNavMenu) That margin will grow, since its waiting on Mail-in ballots. But it is far closer than New York should be. 

New York's Mayor, Eric Adams (who was a former Republican), was basically helping Republicans, both by running New York terribly and creating non-stop scandals, going to every media source, and nonstop talking about out-of-control crime in New York, despite the city being very safe relative to the rest of America. Basically doing the New York Post's job for them. 

Republicans because of this, are on track to flip multiple seats in New York. Given how thin the House margins are, these New York seats could very well be the difference between a Democratic and Republican majority. If you are in New York, you need to join the Democratic Party and take it over. And kick out Eric Adams when he is up for reelection. 


Now lets talk nationally.

**Senate**

Democrats have almost certainly maintained control of the Senate. They have already flipped the Pennsylvania, Senate seat. The current breakdown is 48 Democratic Seats to 47 Republican seats. Of them, from most to least Democratic. 

**Georgia** - Warnock leads in Georgia. Based on the remaining ballots, Walker has no hope of getting past him, it's only a question of does Warnock makes it to 50% and avoids a runoff, or does a runoff happen? In a state without a runoff system, you could call this now for Warnock.

If it does go to a runoff, as is fairly likely, Walker very likely loses. Walker was pushed up by stronger performing Republicans on the ticket, like Governor Kemp was who reelected. Now he is alone on the ballot, with all the focus on his wife beating, abortion paying, brain damaged and extreme positions. I would call this Likely D. (49D)

**Arizona** currently stands at Lean Democratic. Mark Kelly leads Peter Thiel's court jester and fascist creep, Blake Masters. The remaining vote is Republican-leaning, but Blake Masters is underperforming his bench marks. I'd peg this as Lean to Likely D (50D, which is a majority with the VP tiebreaker).

**Nevada** is listed as a tossup by most election watchers. However Ralston, the Nevada expert is saying its tilts CCM the Democratic candidate. The votes remaining are either rural (Republican) and mail in (Democratic). (51D. Which means Democrats could loss either Manchin or Sinema on a vote).

**Wisconsin** is listed as likely R, by most election watchers. However, they can't call it, as there are quite a lot of votes left to count in heavily Democratic Milwaukee. Likely the incumbent Ron Johnson will hang on. But if he doesn't Barnes, would make it  52D.

**Alaska** isn't going to be won by Democrats. However, the contest is between moderate Republican Lisa Murkowski and a MAGA crazy. Democrats didn''t seriously try and contest Alaska's senate seat, to help Murkowski. 

So Democrats look to hold the Senate. Republicans would need a lot of lucky breaks, to win all but one of these races. 


**The House** 

Republican gerrymandering for the most part worked. Democrats look to narrowly lose the House. However, it hasn't been called, so Democrats still have a path to a narrow Democratic majority. 

However, the average projection of Republican seats after the election, [looks to be only about 224](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-needle-forecast.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=NavBar) and it could fall lower, as California votes come in. Note that a House majority is 218, so Republicans are looking at a margin of error of less then ten seats.

Now Nancy Pelosi managed to do a lot with an even smaller House majority. But Kevin McCarthy isn't Nancy Pelosi and is widely considered an idiot and moron. And smarter Republicans, have been fucked over, with bigger majorities.

John Boehner, who had a massive majority after 2014, [still ended up rage-quitting and saying that a massive part of his party, were 'assholes, terrorists and anarchists"".](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/john-boehner-on-republican-party) 

So key areas to highlight. Tim Ryan may have lost, but he helped carry [Ohio Democrats to 5 House seats](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-ohio.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=StateNavMenu). Ohio Democrats were widely considered to only be in the running for 2-3 seats, due to extreme GOP gerrymandering. Gerrymandering which was struck down by the Ohio supreme court ... and then the state legislature just ignored it. But Ohio Democrats despite losing statewide, managed to overcome the gerrymander and win 5. 

In North Carolina, Cheri Beasly also lost, but she helped get Democrats to [7 of the 14 House seats in the State](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-north-carolina.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=StateNavMenu).

 
**Governors and State Legislatures** 

Democrats have already gained Trifectas in Maryland and Massachusetts, by gaining the governor's office, and in [Minnesota by gaining the State Senate](https://twitter.com/MinnesotaDFL/status/1590256795901374465). That means that in all three states, Democrats now can legislate freely without Republican opposition. The first two aren't earth-shattering, as Democrats could override the GOP Governors vetos anyway with their legislatures, if all agreed. [But Democrats have gone without control of Minnesota since they lost control of a chamber in 2014.](https://ballotpedia.org/Party_control_of_Minnesota_state_government) 

All three of these states can now start passing progressive legislation, and governing without GOP sabotage.

Also in the running are Michigan and Pennsylvania. Democrats have already been called as retaining both Governor offices, defeating extremist Republicans. But in addition, they have also flipped one state legislature in [Michigan the State Senate](https://mobile.twitter.com/SamSteckloff/status/1590274641989206018).

[In Michigan, Democrats' projections also means they will get the State House](https://twitter.com/umichvoter/status/1590287242341519360). Which would make a full trifecta. 

[PA they are close to grabbing both the State House and Senate.](https://twitter.com/malcolmkenyatta/status/1590246842369183745) [One election watcher, who is a expert in state legislatures, says it is Lean D.](https://twitter.com/ChazNuttycombe/status/1590248206545584130) 

So in total, Democrats are in the running to gain 5 Trifectas. 

On defence, the only trifecta they might lose is Nevada Governor, as the Republican is performing a bit better there, and Oregon. 

Democrats in Governor races have held up incredibly well. They won massively in Maine, they held the line against an election denier in Wisconsin, and they flattened extremist Republicans in Michigan and Pennsylvania. They retained New Mexico, and they are narrowly leading Republicans to keep the Governor of Kansas. There is a possibility that they don't lose any Governor race where they held the seat. 

The open questions are in Arizona, where Katie Hobbs is running behind Mark Kelly. Kari Lake is an insane election denier. Winning Arizona is very big. Then the aforementioned Nevada, Oregon and Kansas. 

On the offensive Democrats did a bit weaker. They flopped vs Brian Kemp in Georgia. Beto did okay, doing better than the 2018 Governor nominee in 2018 (but way worse than against Cruz). And in Oklahoma, despite a major overperformance, Democrats failed to unseat Kevin Stitt, despite all the damage he did to his state, and his deep unpopularity, due to wrecking the state's schools with budget cuts and charter schools. 


**Ballot Measures**

Tens of thousands of people in South Dakota will now get Healthcare, as the state voted to expand Medicaid, an Obamacare measure that the Supreme Court decided was up to states to opt into. The deal is the federal government pays for 90% of those in between the old and new line, and the state pays 10%. Pretty good deal right? Yeah not if you are a Republican. They'd rather let their voters die, than~~ expand Obamacare~~ pay 10%. 

[So to get around the Republican state legislature and Governor, the state organised and passed a ballot measure.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2022/11/09/medicaid-expansion-wins-in-red-state-south-dakota/?sh=244cd8596b5c) Leaving just 11 of the 50 states yet to expand Medicaid. This continues the winning streak of Medicaid expansion always winning, if it makes the ballot. 

[Voters in California, Michigan, and Vermont on Tuesday adopted constitutional amendments that enshrine abortion rights into their state constitutions](https://boltsmag.org/measures-to-protect-abortion-rights-triumph-on-tuesday/). 

&gt;Kentuckyians were similarly voting on Tuesday on a constitutional amendment that would have declared that their state constitution does not protect abortion rights, and just like Kansas they rejected the measure. 

&gt;Montana decided yet another measure pertaining to abortion on Tuesday. Unlike the other referendums, this concerned a state statute that required medical care be given to any infant ‚Äúborn alive‚Äù after induced labor, cesarean sections, or attempted abortions. The bill was drafted to mirror model legislation advanced by national anti-abortion groups, and was condemned by abortion-rights advocates and abortion providers as addressing a non-existent problem‚Äîespecially given the rarity of late-term abortions generally. The measure appeared to be failing on Tuesday night, but regardless would likely have little impact on the legality and availability of abortion in Montana.


In terms of weed, there was a split. [In Maryland and Missouri voters went for legislation.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/ballot-measures) However, Arkansas South Dakota and North Dakota voted against legalising weed. 


There is way more ballots and races left, so not everything above is final. But overall its a massive win, particularly compared to 2010 or 2014.",An overview of some of the Wins and Losses of the Election.,1667990001,"An overview of some of the Wins and Losses of the Election. Democrats defied political gravity to absolutely smash out a midterm. [Of course early on, as predicted Florida fucked Democrats hard.](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/yplw8d/its_election_time_folks_us_midterm_rumble/).

But Democrats in most other states come out swinging and scored some serious wins.

**Florida** 

L - Florida Democrats

W - Florida Republicans

Florida is a hell mouth. A cursed land inhabited by demons. 

Florida Democrats just absolutely collapsed here. DeSantis rigged the whole state with an insane gerrymander (that because of Republicans' massive overperformance is kinda a dummymander and sort of limited how high they could have gone). Democrats got majorly outspent, [Qanon and other insanity has taken over Florida Latin American emigree communities](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/05/politics/florida-election-lies-spanish-language/index.html), just utterly bleak.

[Rubio won 57.7% to Val Demmings 41.3% at the time of this post. 
](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-florida.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=StateNavMenu)

DeSantis won 59.4% to Crist's 40% at the time of this post.

This is in a year, where the national popular vote is likely 2-3 +D after accounting for uncontested races. Florida is a red state. 

If you live in Florida, just leave. The state is a cursed land, and it's going to be underwater. Just move. Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, New Hampshire, PA, MI, WI, just any swing state. There are just too many insane right-wing Latin American exiles, too many Fox News-addled retirees, and too many hard-core conservatives leaving other states to escape 'covid' tyranny and moving to Florida. 

But the reason it is worth mentioning is it could be a major secret L for Trump. Florida Republicans are essentially the only ones who can claim to have a rock-solid victory. Led by DeSantis, who now with this victory under his belt. While Trump looming over this election can be used to claim that Trump cost them seats. This could be the start of a Republican Civil war.

**New York**

W - New York Republicans, Cuomo. 

L - New York Democrats, the House Majority possibly. 

If Republicans still win a House Majority, the fault is down to New York. [New York Judges, a conservative body made up of Cuomo appointees struck down the Democratic gerrymander, drawn to counter GOP gerrymanders in other states](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/nyregion/redistricting-congress-gerrymander-ny.html). They didn't do this out of a sincere anti-gerrymandering stance, since they allowed the previous State Senate maps to stand, which were gerrymandered in the Republicans' favour. 

New York Democrats were also either asleep at the wheel, or actively aiding the GOP. [New York Governor Kathy Hochul,, at the time of this post, is only winning by a bit over 5 points, in New York, against a pro-insurrectionist former House member.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-new-york.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=StateNavMenu) That margin will grow, since its waiting on Mail-in ballots. But it is far closer than New York should be. 

New York's Mayor, Eric Adams (who was a former Republican), was basically helping Republicans, both by running New York terribly and creating non-stop scandals, going to every media source, and nonstop talking about out-of-control crime in New York, despite the city being very safe relative to the rest of America. Basically doing the New York Post's job for them. 

Republicans because of this, are on track to flip multiple seats in New York. Given how thin the House margins are, these New York seats could very well be the difference between a Democratic and Republican majority. If you are in New York, you need to join the Democratic Party and take it over. And kick out Eric Adams when he is up for reelection. 


Now lets talk nationally.

**Senate**

Democrats have almost certainly maintained control of the Senate. They have already flipped the Pennsylvania, Senate seat. The current breakdown is 48 Democratic Seats to 47 Republican seats. Of them, from most to least Democratic. 

**Georgia** - Warnock leads in Georgia. Based on the remaining ballots, Walker has no hope of getting past him, it's only a question of does Warnock makes it to 50% and avoids a runoff, or does a runoff happen? In a state without a runoff system, you could call this now for Warnock.

If it does go to a runoff, as is fairly likely, Walker very likely loses. Walker was pushed up by stronger performing Republicans on the ticket, like Governor Kemp was who reelected. Now he is alone on the ballot, with all the focus on his wife beating, abortion paying, brain damaged and extreme positions. I would call this Likely D. (49D)

**Arizona** currently stands at Lean Democratic. Mark Kelly leads Peter Thiel's court jester and fascist creep, Blake Masters. The remaining vote is Republican-leaning, but Blake Masters is underperforming his bench marks. I'd peg this as Lean to Likely D (50D, which is a majority with the VP tiebreaker).

**Nevada** is listed as a tossup by most election watchers. However Ralston, the Nevada expert is saying its tilts CCM the Democratic candidate. The votes remaining are either rural (Republican) and mail in (Democratic). (51D. Which means Democrats could loss either Manchin or Sinema on a vote).

**Wisconsin** is listed as likely R, by most election watchers. However, they can't call it, as there are quite a lot of votes left to count in heavily Democratic Milwaukee. Likely the incumbent Ron Johnson will hang on. But if he doesn't Barnes, would make it  52D.

**Alaska** isn't going to be won by Democrats. However, the contest is between moderate Republican Lisa Murkowski and a MAGA crazy. Democrats didn''t seriously try and contest Alaska's senate seat, to help Murkowski. 

So Democrats look to hold the Senate. Republicans would need a lot of lucky breaks, to win all but one of these races. 


**The House** 

Republican gerrymandering for the most part worked. Democrats look to narrowly lose the House. However, it hasn't been called, so Democrats still have a path to a narrow Democratic majority. 

However, the average projection of Republican seats after the election, [looks to be only about 224](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-needle-forecast.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=NavBar) and it could fall lower, as California votes come in. Note that a House majority is 218, so Republicans are looking at a margin of error of less then ten seats.

Now Nancy Pelosi managed to do a lot with an even smaller House majority. But Kevin McCarthy isn't Nancy Pelosi and is widely considered an idiot and moron. And smarter Republicans, have been fucked over, with bigger majorities.

John Boehner, who had a massive majority after 2014, [still ended up rage-quitting and saying that a massive part of his party, were 'assholes, terrorists and anarchists"".](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/john-boehner-on-republican-party) 

So key areas to highlight. Tim Ryan may have lost, but he helped carry [Ohio Democrats to 5 House seats](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-ohio.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=StateNavMenu). Ohio Democrats were widely considered to only be in the running for 2-3 seats, due to extreme GOP gerrymandering. Gerrymandering which was struck down by the Ohio supreme court ... and then the state legislature just ignored it. But Ohio Democrats despite losing statewide, managed to overcome the gerrymander and win 5. 

In North Carolina, Cheri Beasly also lost, but she helped get Democrats to [7 of the 14 House seats in the State](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-north-carolina.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=StateNavMenu).

 
**Governors and State Legislatures** 

Democrats have already gained Trifectas in Maryland and Massachusetts, by gaining the governor's office, and in [Minnesota by gaining the State Senate](https://twitter.com/MinnesotaDFL/status/1590256795901374465). That means that in all three states, Democrats now can legislate freely without Republican opposition. The first two aren't earth-shattering, as Democrats could override the GOP Governors vetos anyway with their legislatures, if all agreed. [But Democrats have gone without control of Minnesota since they lost control of a chamber in 2014.](https://ballotpedia.org/Party_control_of_Minnesota_state_government) 

All three of these states can now start passing progressive legislation, and governing without GOP sabotage.

Also in the running are Michigan and Pennsylvania. Democrats have already been called as retaining both Governor offices, defeating extremist Republicans. But in addition, they have also flipped one state legislature in [Michigan the State Senate](https://mobile.twitter.com/SamSteckloff/status/1590274641989206018).

[In Michigan, Democrats' projections also means they will get the State House](https://twitter.com/umichvoter/status/1590287242341519360). Which would make a full trifecta. 

[PA they are close to grabbing both the State House and Senate.](https://twitter.com/malcolmkenyatta/status/1590246842369183745) [One election watcher, who is a expert in state legislatures, says it is Lean D.](https://twitter.com/ChazNuttycombe/status/1590248206545584130)

Each state will have various voter guides, just make sure it's one from a Group of progressives, and not Republicans, church groups, NIMBYs or other bad types trying to trick voters.

Be aware that ballots in many states will have both partisan races, and 'non-partisan' races (that still might be partisan contests). Lower-level officials and judges can still be incredibly powerful. State Supreme Courts are incredibly powerful and can allow or block gerrymanders. A big reason why Democrats even have their narrow house control is that they won State Supreme Court offices, which struck down Republican gerrymanders in multiple states. As well as rule on a host of legal issues. 

Make sure to research the ballots. There will be lots of various ballot measures many of which will be deliberately confusing. There are big things on the ballot as well. The fate of healthcare for tens of Thousands, in South Dakota's Medicaid expansion vote. The reproductive rights of millions, in multiple states. Weed is on the ballot in multiple states. As is many criminal justice measures. Minimum wages. etc

If you are watching the live coverage some things to note.

**Don't overdose on the early votes.** Some states will start off very blue and some states will start off really red. Different states have different methods of counting. Some will tend to count their rural votes extremely quickly, and then votes from urban areas will trickle in. Some states won't start counting mail-in ballots until the polls close (a law that Republicans in multiple state legislatures backed to help Trump cry fraud). That leads to red mirages, like what happened in 2020.

Alternatively, some states pre-count mail-in ballots and count their cities fast. So for example Ohio could look insanely good for Democrats. At first. Then their lead will diminish fast. That also happened in 2020.

**Florida will also likely be a bad sign.** They are a big state, their polls close super early, and they count very fast, due to their election laws. While Republicans this year have massively outspent Democrats, there are very few competitive races due to gerrymandering, and DeSantis has scared off a lot of voters with his 'voter fraud' arrests. Florida is also full of old Republican retirees who vote in every election, while Democrats are dependent on a lot of variable voters who often don't show up for elections. In 2020, all the doom narratives basically started as Florida started reporting. Florida will most likely be bad. But Florida also isn't really representative of the wider US. The signs that Biden was going to win, were already showing as Indionpolis suburbs reported, but people stopped paying attention to those, as Miami swung to Trump. 

**Don't Trust Twitter**. Elon Musk has fired most of Twitter's work staff, he is rolling out an all-new verification system, and traffic to Twitter is going to spike hard. The Chans and other right-wing sites will be organising raids as well, and now there are few if any content moderators. And Elon wants to encourage the trolls and has endorsed Republicans. So the best bet is to be highly sceptical of stuff you see on Twitter. 

**Be careful at the polls**. If a group tries fucking around at the polls, like the Arizona ballot watchers, there are tiplines manned by election lawyers who can bring the hammer down hard. If you see something, speak up, or call the professionals. Don't let them get away with crimes. 

**It could be a very long night.** With the House and Senate so close, majority control of either chamber could have to wait for the West Coast, or counting every ballot. The West Coast states allow mail-in ballots that are postmarked, to arrive for days after the election. (If you are voting that method tho, you should take it to a dropbox to make sure it gets counted).[ If it gets hyper-close, then it could even come down to Alaska's House seats, ranked-choice voting which took weeks to count then call.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Alaska%27s_at-large_congressional_district_special_election).

The Senate could also come down to a runoff. Georgia is one of the most competitive races, between incumbent Raphael Warnock a Democratic Senator, the pastor of MLK's former church, and a progressive. And Herschel Walker a brain-damaged footballer, who just loves paying for abortions, beating his wife, and repeatably saying he has now been saved by Christ, and that's why people who do abortions should be locked up. Yeah its Georgia, so it's likely still close.

They have a system where if neither candidate gets over 50%, then it goes to a runoff. [So Senate control like in 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_United_States_Senate_election_in_Georgia), could [come down to a runoff.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_United_States_Senate_special_election_in_Georgia)",It's Election time folks.

Give someone a lift to the polls. If someone is unsure of a race or you think they may be swayable, help them find some information on it. Don't go full debate lord, but try and put pressure where you think it will work. Use the right arguments on the right people, not everybody is progressive, so they might need different arguments.

Each state will have various voter guides, just make sure it's one from a Group of progressives, and not Republicans, church groups, NIMBYs or other bad types trying to trick voters.

Be aware that ballots in many states will have both partisan races, and 'non-partisan' races (that still might be partisan contests). Lower-level officials and judges can still be incredibly powerful. State Supreme Courts are incredibly powerful and can allow or block gerrymanders. A big reason why Democrats even have their narrow house control is that they won State Supreme Court offices, which struck down Republican gerrymanders in multiple states. As well as rule on a host of legal issues. 

Make sure to research the ballots. There will be lots of various ballot measures many of which will be deliberately confusing. There are big things on the ballot as well. The fate of healthcare for tens of Thousands, in South Dakota's Medicaid expansion vote. The reproductive rights of millions, in multiple states. Weed is on the ballot in multiple states. As is many criminal justice measures. Minimum wages. etc

If you are watching the live coverage some things to note.

I believe that the mixed economy and the welfare state is the best humanity has done thus far, and likely be the best we can do for a long time in the future. However, unlike liberals I do not hold private property to be a right on the same level as rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, for example. I believe that private enterprises must justify themselves through social utility and benefit to society. As such, I am open to further socialization of the economy when automation and other technological advances render private property in a sector superfluous. I am not ideologically opposed to private property, I think there will always be some private sector of the economy, even if it becomes smaller.  I don't believe in LTV.

Immediately I support the expansion of the wealth state and social programs, and the strengthening and institutionalizing of the labor unions.

I do not know what a future socialism looks like, and don't believe anyone who claims to have a working model for the future that society is supposed to conform to. I don't believe in final goals or end points of history, there will always be change, such as technological development, cultural change, and ecological change.

But I still see this from The Young Turks, Kyle Kulinski, and Majority Report currently, as they heavily cater to these audiences.  I feel like they're still stuck in the 2008 - 2020 mindset, when they were disillusioned by the Democratic Party &amp; Obama and there was still a chance to elect a leftist (Bernie). But that time is gone.

For example, when Kyle was covering the Paul Pelosi attack, he of course condemned it, but he had to preface it by saying ""I really despite Nancy Pelosi, but she shouldn't be attacked"". Like, he can't even condemn a fascist violent attack without prefacing it by reminding the audience that he hates Democrats.

There's a right time and way to criticize Democrats. I think Vaush and Pakman do a pretty good job of it. They have lots of criticisms of Democrats, but they make it clear that they're still all in for Democrats and they excite the audience to vote blue.

709,VaushV,"**Introduction**

Ontario is set to face one of the biggest strikes in Canadian history. Premier Doug Ford has taken unprecedented action in an attempt to outlaw a worker's right to collective bargaining. Fearing a walkout by Ontario education workers, Ford's government in recent days has invoked the notwithstanding clause, essentially an article in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that allows legislatures to temporarily suspend sections of the Charter. This move was made to bind 55,000 education workers into an undemocratic contract, echoing elements of ""back-to-work"" legislation in the United States. The legislation would also fine workers $4,000 a day and the union $500,000 for striking. This would be the first time in Canadian history that a provincial or federal legislature has taken such a move in an attempt to end labour action.

I know this was already talked about on this subreddit, but to link a single article is to void the necessary context and magnitude of the event. Here I'm going to try to breakdown the current labour dispute unfolding its broader context. I'll then try to answer its broader implications. This is an informative thread aimed at being a call to action for

**Striker's Grievances**

* CUPE has stated their workers' make an average $39,000 a year ($28,816 USD), representing the lowest paid earners in schools. CUPE's negotiation started by asking for 11.7% annual salary increases ([CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cupe-strike-education-ontario-schools-closed-1.6640386#:~:text=CUPE%20has%20said%20its%20workers,increases%20of%2011.7%20per%20cent)).
* CUPE education workers' wages have been stagnant in comparison to other unionized sectors relating to inflation. ([@VanmalaS on Twitter, Financial Post journalist \*CHART\*](https://twitter.com/VanmalaS/status/1587807690432122880))
* **""**More than 50% of the workers surveyed said that they work more than one job to make ends meet. 33% were sole-income earners for their households."" ([@VanmalaS on Twitter](https://twitter.com/VanmalaS/status/1587807425620590596))
* Ford's government has stated it would not negotiate unless the strike was called off.

**Ford's Rhetoric**

* The justification Ford has stuck with in this dispute is that he is ""determined to keep children in school"" after they have fallen victim to lockdowns and stay-at-home orders during the pandemic.
* This strawman argument echoes similar rhetoric regarding a smaller CUPE labour dispute in Newfoundland in late August. After city workers of Mount Pearl picketed across city institutions and premises, all major news outlets in the province chose the angle of the victimized children being denied the right to summertime sports after suffering prolonged lockdowns ([CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/mount-pearl-strike-youth-sports-1.6516847)).

I'm not necessarily drawing a correlation between the two, however it highlights the manipulative nature of these union-busting campaigns, often resorting to arguments designed to make the opposition appear to be unreasonable agitators instead of victims earning starvation wages.

**Union Action**

* CUPE (Canadian Union of Public Employees that represents the 55,000 education workers) have stated they are striking ""indefinitely"" and vowing to return to the kind of labour action from the time before legally protected strikes even existed. ""They don't know what they just started."" This will continue until the bill they passed is repealed [@Alan\_S\_Hale on Twitter, journalist for Queen Park Today](https://twitter.com/Alan_S_Hale/status/1588257158755454976)).
* CUPE Ontario President has met with other union leaders and has stated ""We will build resistance. We will bring others to this resistance, we will keep going"" ([@AhmarSKhan on Twitter, Global News journalist](https://twitter.com/AhmarSKhan/status/1588939042686906368)).
*  8,000 workers from the Ontario Public Service Employees Union have called for a strike in solidarity with CUPE ([Toronto City News](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2022/11/03/education-workers-strike-opseu-cupe/)).
* 2,200 GO transit workers are set to strike on Monday as no deal with Metrolinx was met, a development independent of the CUPE strike ([Global News](https://globalnews.ca/news/9254184/go-transit-wokers-strike/)).
* University of Western Ontario Faculty Association, representing 1,800 employees may  strike on 14 November if no deal is reached with the university, also independent development of CUPE strike ([Western Gazette](https://westerngazette.ca/news/faculty-union-sets-up-strike-headquarters-with-11-days-until-possible-strike/article_35cd4e32-5add-11ed-bc1d-a73584739357.html)).
* United Steelworkers Union representing Pinecrest Nursing Home workers have been denied striking rights by this legislation, whether they will still go ahead in withdrawing their labour is yet to be seen ([United Steelworkers](https://www.usw.ca/pinecrest-nursing-home-workers-rally/)).
* Unifor (largest private sector union in Canada representing 310,000 workers) has pledged $100,000 to fight fees against CUPE ([Unifor](https://www.unifor.org/news/all-news/unifor-pledges-100000-donation-support-striking-cupe-education-workers)).
* Several unions such as the Elementary Secondary Teachers' Federation, Ontario Nurses' Association, United Steel Workers, and The International Association of Fire Fighters, have all issued statements in solidarity with CUPE picketers. As of now, none of these unions have plans on striking themselves, however a few unions are picketing alongside CUPE outside working hours.

**Response From Politicians**

* Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued a statement expressing Ford's use of the notwithstanding clause to be ""wrong and inappropriate."" This statement appears to be the harshest rhetoric he is willing to use, as he has reiterated its ""inappropriateness"" several times. He has also issued statements in solidarity with striking workers, however no action specifically by the Liberal government has been taken ([@JustinTrudeau on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1587982284212535296)).
* Jagmeet Singh, leader of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP), called an emergency debate in Parliament in light of this development, which was rejected by the Conservative Deputy Speaker. He has denounced the Ford government as trampling on the constitutional rights of educational workers ([@theJagmeetSingh on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theJagmeetSingh/status/1587869821450215424)). His motion for the federal government to stand with workers passed in the house with Liberal support. He took this time to call out the federal Conservative Party leader along with his provincial leaders as ""waging war on workers"", seizing the opportunity to also denounce the Premier of Alberta in their attempt to lower the minimum wage ([@theJagmeetSingh on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theJagmeetSingh/status/1588206952303181831)). His rhetoric is unmatched by any federal party leader, as he has launched legislative motions, petitions and almost all of his tweets and public appearances in recent days have been expressing his outrage and calling for workers and politicians to seek immediate action. 
* Pierre Poilevre, leader of the federal Conservative Party, has been silent on the ongoing labour dispute. This is not at all surprising, as he served in Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet, a notoriously anti-union legislator ([Toronto Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/04/23/harpers-anti-union-bill-rises-from-the-dead-tim-harper.html)). This should then be no surprise that his party voted against the NDP motion in standing with striking workers. He has championed worker action in the past, which was clearly nothing more than empty statements to boost his ""populist"" image.
* The Provincial NDP of Ontario, currently the official opposition in the Ontario Provincial Parliament, have been fierce opponents of Ford's unprecedented actions. Debate in the legislature got extremely heated a few days ago, with screaming matches unfolding as half of NDP MPP's were ejected from the premise for unparliamentary behaviour ([Toronto City News \*VIDEO\*](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2022/11/02/ontario-legislature-mpps-ndp-kicked-out/)). Unfortunately there is little the provincial NDP can do, as the Conservatives hold a majority in the house.

**Implications**

Many have called for the complete withdrawal of all labour in the province in response to Doug Ford's actions. A general strike is incredibly hard to predict as it appears now, however if the right to collective bargaining is completely  done away with in the province, this may force the hand of the unions to seek action. Keep in mind this a recent and ongoing development in Ontario, with more strikes set to kickstart on Monday. The rhetoric coming from CUPE leadership is that they are determined to picket for as long as necessary until Ford's legislation is repealed. If I've learned anything from studying labour action, it's that violence is a high probability in large disputes such as this. However, whether more unions will join the strike in solidarity is yet to be seen.

What we can conclude from our political leadership is that the NDP remains the only voice for the working class in any legislature across the country, with Conservatives offering lies and lip service and the Liberal government weak and passive rhetoric. Liberals may be doing more than nothing in that they voted for a symbolic condemnation of Ford, but never forget the true champions of working people have always been the NDP.

**Public Opinion**

* When asked ""who do you blame most for schools being closed due to education worker strike?"", 62% answered ""the provincial government"" (72% for parents of younger kids) with 28% answering ""Education workers"" ([Polling Canada, Abacus Data 1)](https://twitter.com/CanadianPolling/status/1588923847931482112) This highlights the undemocratic nature of Ford's political antics, even if conservative propaganda has already rotted the brain of nearly 3/10ths of the province.
* When asked ""Would you support or oppose other unions walking off the job to protest the provincial governments alongside education workers?"", 48% responded support, 34% oppose, with 18% unsure ([Polling Canada, Abacus Data 2](https://twitter.com/CanadianPolling/status/1588923674731884544))  

Considering this form of worker action could a series of public disobedience not seen in Canada in over since the 1919 Winnipeg general strike, these numbers aren't entirely worrying. What cannot be determined, however, is the direction they are prone to swing. Regardless, these numbers are succumb to change as the story develops.

**How Can I Help?**

* If you live in Ontario, please consider joining the picket lines with striking workers. On 12 November, Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL), CUPE and affiliates are considering a mass protest in Queens Park. Our strength is in our numbers. Keep posted on events on CUPE's website ([Here](https://cupe.on.ca/))
* Send Doug Ford a message or find a picket line near you ([Here](https://cupe.on.ca/dontbeabully/))
* Sign NDP petition in demanding the protection of worker's constitutional rights ([Here](https://ndp.ca/workers-rights?source=20221102_SOC_WR_1_AYN_TW_JS_EN_ALL&amp;utm_medium=SOC&amp;utm_source=TW&amp;utm_campaign=Worker%27s%20Rights_ALL&amp;utm_content=20221102_SOC_WR_1_AYN_TW_JS_EN_ALL))
* For those living outside Canada, educating yourself and raising awareness of the draconian measures governments will take in suppressing worker action is essential.
* Share this post to raise awareness ;)

**Notes**

I realize many of my sources come from Twitter, most being local journalists reporting on city/provincial politics. I feel these to be reliable sources, as they are directly interviewing politicians, union leaders, activists, etc. That being said, I feel this analysis adequately describes the situation unfolding in Ontario to the best of my knowledge, however if anyone has evidence to suggest what I stated to be either misleading or incorrect, I'm more than willing to make corrections. As an honours student of Political Science, I am very passionate about labour organizing and Canadian politics so I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, even to those who merely skimmed through.

**TL;DR**

Due to legislation by the ""Progressive"" Conservative Party of Ontario in revoking the Canadian Charter's right to organize and collective bargain, over 65,000 workers are set to go on strike, leaving much speculation as to if other unions will join the fight against this unprecedented legislation. What is clear through all this is the NDP's vigilance in protecting worker's rights on a provincial and national scale, but to little avail. Only time will tell how this event will unfold; violence may ensue, propaganda is inevitable, but of course, our solidarity is forever.",ONTARIO LABOUR DISPUTE BREAKDOWN - GENERAL STRIKE?

This is not at all surprising, as he served in Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet, a notoriously anti-union legislator ([Toronto Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/04/23/harpers-anti-union-bill-rises-from-the-dead-tim-harper.html)). This should then be no surprise that his party voted against the NDP motion in standing with striking workers. He has championed worker action in the past, which was clearly nothing more than empty statements to boost his ""populist"" image.
* The Provincial NDP of Ontario, currently the official opposition in the Ontario Provincial Parliament, have been fierce opponents of Ford's unprecedented actions. Debate in the legislature got extremely heated a few days ago, with screaming matches unfolding as half of NDP MPP's were ejected from the premise for unparliamentary behaviour ([Toronto City News \*VIDEO\*](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2022/11/02/ontario-legislature-mpps-ndp-kicked-out/)). Unfortunately there is little the provincial NDP can do, as the Conservatives hold a majority in the house.

**Implications**

Many have called for the complete withdrawal of all labour in the province in response to Doug Ford's actions. A general strike is incredibly hard to predict as it appears now, however if the right to collective bargaining is completely  done away with in the province, this may force the hand of the unions to seek action. Keep in mind this a recent and ongoing development in Ontario, with more strikes set to kickstart on Monday. The rhetoric coming from CUPE leadership is that they are determined to picket for as long as necessary until Ford's legislation is repealed. If I've learned anything from studying labour action, it's that violence is a high probability in large disputes such as this. However, whether more unions will join the strike in solidarity is yet to be seen.

What we can conclude from our political leadership is that the NDP remains the only voice for the working class in any legislature across the country, with Conservatives offering lies and lip service and the Liberal government weak and passive rhetoric. Liberals may be doing more than nothing in that they voted for a symbolic condemnation of Ford, but never forget the true champions of working people have always been the NDP.

**Public Opinion**

* When asked ""who do you blame most for schools being closed due to education worker strike?"", 62% answered ""the provincial government"" (72% for parents of younger kids) with 28% answering ""Education workers"" ([Polling Canada, Abacus Data 1)](https://twitter.com/CanadianPolling/status/1588923847931482112) This highlights the undemocratic nature of Ford's political antics, even if conservative propaganda has already rotted the brain of nearly 3/10ths of the province.
* When asked ""Would you support or oppose other unions walking off the job to protest the provincial governments alongside education workers?"", 48% responded support, 34% oppose, with 18% unsure ([Polling Canada, Abacus Data 2](https://twitter.com/CanadianPolling/status/1588923674731884544))  

Considering this form of worker action could a series of public disobedience not seen in Canada in over since the 1919 Winnipeg general strike, these numbers aren't entirely worrying. What cannot be determined, however, is the direction they are prone to swing. Regardless, these numbers are succumb to change as the story develops.

**How Can I Help?**

* If you live in Ontario, please consider joining the picket lines with striking workers. On 12 November, Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL), CUPE and affiliates are considering a mass protest in Queens Park. Our strength is in our numbers. Keep posted on events on CUPE's website ([Here](https://cupe.on.ca/))
* Send Doug Ford a message or find a picket line near you ([Here](https://cupe.on.ca/dontbeabully/))
* Sign NDP petition in demanding the protection of worker's constitutional rights ([Here](https://ndp.ca/workers-rights?source=20221102_SOC_WR_1_AYN_TW_JS_EN_ALL&amp;utm_medium=SOC&amp;utm_source=TW&amp;utm_campaign=Worker%27s%20Rights_ALL&amp;utm_content=20221102_SOC_WR_1_AYN_TW_JS_EN_ALL))
* For those living outside Canada, educating yourself and raising awareness of the draconian measures governments will take in suppressing worker action is essential.
* Share this post to raise awareness ;)

**Notes**

I realize many of my sources come from Twitter, most being local journalists reporting on city/provincial politics. I feel these to be reliable sources, as they are directly interviewing politicians, union leaders, activists, etc. That being said, I feel this analysis adequately describes the situation unfolding in Ontario to the best of my knowledge, however if anyone has evidence to suggest what I stated to be either misleading or incorrect, I'm more than willing to make corrections. As an honours student of Political Science, I am very passionate about labour organizing and Canadian politics so I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, even to those who merely skimmed through.

**TL;DR**

Due to legislation by the ""Progressive"" Conservative Party of Ontario in revoking the Canadian Charter's right to organize and collective bargain, over 65,000 workers are set to go on strike, leaving much speculation as to if other unions will join the fight against this unprecedented legislation. What is clear through all this is the NDP's vigilance in protecting worker's rights on a provincial and national scale, but to little avail. Only time will tell how this event will unfold; violence may ensue, propaganda is inevitable, but of course, our solidarity is forever."

**Background**

The US Midterms are on Tuesday, the 8th of November 2022. The US House, and Senate, as well as various State Governor's races, state legislature elections and other local races like sheriffs and judges, are all on the ballot.

This is the first midterm of the Biden admin, the first set of elections since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and the election that sets the stage for 2024. Trump and his Republican allies have made it clear, that they are electing a slate of candidates to help him win back power in 2024 by any means necessary.  

[Control of the Senate is currently split 50-50 with the VP as a tiebreaker.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_elections) The Senate in addition to passing or blocking legislation also has the power to appoint judges and federal officials. The only threat to the Republican-controlled Supreme Court is a Democratic majority. If they merely maintain their current 50-50 split, they can replace a conservative judge that dies or retires. If they expand their majority, with progressives like [Fetterman](https://twitter.com/johnfetterman/status/1410621404052078594?lang=en), [Barnes](https://twitter.com/theothermandela/status/1521296043626971148), [Ryan](https://timforoh.com/tim-ryan-statement-on-supreme-court-overturning-roe-v-wade/) and [Beasley](https://twitter.com/cheribeasleync/status/1561764535488303104?lang=en) then they could expand the court. Each has already vowed to end the filibuster as linked above. But if they lose their majority, then the Supreme Court is free of literally any oversight, and they can do far worse. Overturning Roe v Wade wasn't the end it could be the beginning. 

[This is the map of the Senate battleground
](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/2022_United_States_Senate_elections_retirements_map.svg/350px-2022_United_States_Senate_elections_retirements_map.svg.png)

[Control of the House is also narrowly split. 218 seats are needed for a majority, and currently, Democrats hold 220, and Republicans 212 \(with a few vacant\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections). The House crafts legislation and budgets. [Republicans have already vowed to use a House majority, to cut off aid to Ukraine](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kevin-mccarthy-ukraine-house-november-elections_n_634fcdbfe4b04cf8f37e36b4), [as Republicans steadily turn on Ukraine](https://thehill.com/homenews/3717304-more-republicans-opposed-to-continued-ukraine-aid-survey/). Republicans have also vowed to use every trick they can, to do damage to Biden before the 2024 election, [including threats to take the US economy hostage, to force austerity cuts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/18/mccarthy-gop-medicare-social-security/) to [Social Security, Medicare and other government services](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/gop-members-of-congress-threaten-debt-limit-default-to-cut-social-security-and-medicare/).

Then there are a host of Governor races as well as critically important State Legislatures and Secretary of States, who are in charge of election administration. Donald Trump and his allies have made it an explicit strategy to target these with election deniers. [This article explains which states have Republican election deniers running](https://boltsmag.org/guide-to-2022-secretary-of-state-elections/).

&gt;This new Bolts guide walks through all of those 35 states, plus Washington, D.C., one by one. Voters are electing their secretary of state directly in 27 states; in another eight, the secretary of state will be selected after the election by public officials‚Äîthe governor, or lawmakers‚Äîwho are on the Nov. 8 ballot. (The 15 other states and Puerto Rico will either select theirs after the 2024 cycle or, in a few cases, don‚Äôt have a secretary of state at all.)

https://boltsmag.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022-SOS.png

Explaining every race would be a massive post. [So check out this article](https://boltsmag.org/whats-on-the-ballot/2022-general-election-cheat-sheet/), which breaks down some key races in every state. Even in very red or very blue states, there are major races with real consequences on the ballot. There are Trumpist sheriffs wielding power with an iron fist in blue areas that are now facing the ballot. There are red states where Democrats have a shot of taking power from deeply incompetent and malicious Republicans, like the very tight Oklahoma Governor race, a state that in 2020 voted for Trump by a 33% margin.

There are major consequences to all these elections. LGBT rights, particularly Trans ones are on the ballot. Abortion rights are on the ballot, in electing pro or anti choice, election officials, [as well as in ballot initiatives in multiple states either legalising or criminalising abortion](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/voters-will-say-abortion-5-states-high-stakes-ballot-measures-rcna55523).  Healthcare is on the ballot, [particularly in South Dakota where Medicaid Expansion is on the ballot](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/where-do-states-stand-medicaid-expansion). Climate change spending, social safety net programs, the criminal justice system, etc. All up for grabs. 

**Why combating Fascism Matters**

In Brazil, former President Lula just went up against Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is a self-avowed fascist. [He has praised the brutal right-wing dictatorship of Brazil](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/03/27/brazil-bolsonaro-celebrates-brutal-dictatorship). [He praised the coup in Chile by Pinochet](https://apnews.com/article/3506a62c508e43dcb9687866687c9a8c). He has openly before the election talked about not accepting the results, and that voter fraud would steal the election.

[All this happening in Brazil, a country which unlike the US has had a long history of military coups, and has only again been a democracy since 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship_in_Brazil). 

Bolsonaro's reign in power has been disastrous for Brazil and the world. He presided over massive deaths from COVID due to his idiocy, incompetence and anti-vaccine crankery. Political violence has ramped up. And he and his rancher allies are clear-cutting the Amazon, the lungs of the world to grow crops that strip the soil. Which includes murdering the natives and activists who live in the Amazon and stand in their way. 

And yet Lula is now set to take power, defeating Bolsonaro narrowly in the second round.

Why? [Because the US made it extremely clear](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/10/28/brazil-elections-bolsonaro-democracy-biden/) to [Bolsonaro that it would act against a coup](https://prospect.org/world/how-joe-biden-and-bernie-sanders-helped-lula-win/). [Biden's CIA director even warned Bolsonaro directly not to do a coup](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/exclusive-cia-chief-told-bolsonaro-government-not-mess-with-brazil-election-2022-05-05/).

But let's say we are on Earth Two. [In Earth-Two, Trump won 12,000 more votes in Georgia, 11,000 more in Arizona, 21,000 in Wisconsin and 81,000 in Pennsylvania. Securing his reelection as President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#Close_states).

Trump has of course tried his own coup, and has been very supportive of Bolsonaro's coup. And he is no stranger to interference in Latin America, with the [right-wing carrying out a coup in Bolivia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bolivian_political_crisis) and [attempting invasions of Venezuela](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52592824), as well as trying a maximum pressure strategy against Cuba. Additionally, his CIA head isn't a diplomat like William Burns, but [Gina Haspel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Haspel#Early_career), who ran an illegal black site carrying out torture. 

So on Earth two, instead of seeing Bolsonaro slink home in shame and Lula come to power, Brazil would very likely be seeing a coup in action right now. Bolsonaro's allies arresting the Brazilian Supreme Court which checked him. 'Investigations' into election irregularities. Army tanks and formations in the streets. Riot police breaking up demonstrations in Lula strongholds. Bolsonaro for years clearly thought he could withstand internal opposition to a coup. But he backed down when it was clear he would have to face opposition internally, as well as international opposition. 

Also on Earth Two, the [Russia-Ukraine war has continued in its escalated form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine). Fierce fighting has continued to ravage the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv as Russia seeks to tighten the pocket around the city, while Russian forces are battling in Odesa, attempting to seize the final pieces of the Ukrainian coastline. Russia has aside from a few small pockets, secured all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper river. [Horror stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) of[ mass graves](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2022/09/22/new-mass-graves-found-in-ukraine-as-putins-atrocities-continue/?sh=2457f14758ba), [executions](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/olga-sukhenko-ukraine-mayor-russia-accused-killing-torture/) and [kidnappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#:~:text=During%20the%202022%20Russian%20invasion,adopted%20to%20the%20Russian%20Federation.) have trickled out from behind Russian lines, but the reporting situation is confused, with Russian state media and affiliates, as well as a cross-partisan coalition of Republicans and [some so-called Leftists](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/yjnymt/briahna_joy_gray_is_literally_defending_russian/), [dispute](https://old.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/yl5e9y/david_sacks_a_trumploving_billionaire_is/) the 'EU Line; 

Ukraine has fiercely resisted the full-scale onslaught of Russia's invasion, but the Russian advance, while embarrassed by many blunders has continued to push forward. Ukraine's military situation is desperate as it relies on limited military aid from Europe. However, Europe is caught between the Russian natural gas blackmail and the indifferent US. US aid to Ukraine was limited to a token package of humanitarian aid after Donald Trump successfully vetoed military aid packages crafted by Democrats and Senate Republicans, and their veto override failed in the House due to Republican votes. Zelenskyy from the relocated capital in Lviv in Western Ukraine warns that with the fresh Russian mobilisation, and major shortfalls in military gear, that the Ukrainian lines could rupture, and Russia could advance deep into central Ukraine. Unleashing fresh horrors on the millions of Ukrainians still in their country, and leaving the millions that have already escaped to Europe homeless. 

The EU is also under pressure internally, as far-right forces mobilise against being punished for supporting the Ukrainian lost cause, and the millions of refugees created by the conflict. Hate crimes have spiked and support for helping Ukraine has steadily fallen. Italy, Hungary and Sweden have all officially cut off aid to Ukraine, and further elections could see a number of European countries fall out of the coalition, as more far-right governments are elected.

**Non-Hypotheticals**

Of course, Earth-Two, is just a Hypothetical, even if I do think it is a highly accurate portrayal of what would be in the cards if Donald Trump got his second term. And could still be in the cards if he wins in 2024.

But we also have real-world examples. For the last time, we had an international collection of fascists collaborating together. [The Spanish Civil War saw fierce fighting between the Nationalists and Republicans.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War) The Nationalists won, thanks to decisive support from the German and Italian fascist governments.

If Germany had beaten back Nazism in the early 1930s, then the Nationalists would have had almost no hope of actually winning the war against the Republicans. The revolts by the army were beaten back in most of Spain's major cities. While Franco's elite units were stationed in Spanish North Africa. The Nationalists attempted to gain control of the Spanish navy, but their crews revolted against their officers, blockading the Army of Africa.

[But then German planes were used to ferry over the Nationalist Troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Africa_\(Spain\)#Role_in_the_Spanish_Civil_War).

[The Nazis supplied the Condor Legion to Spain, helping to secure air superiority over the Republican Forces and bomb their cities flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condor_Legion). [They supplied massive amounts of aid, training, and gear and encouraged the Italians to boost their own aid to Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_involvement_in_the_Spanish_Civil_War). As well as discouraged Western Aid to the Spanish Republicans, leaving them in the lopsided position of their enemy receiving lavish aid, while they were cut off, save for a mercenary USSR. Spain bleed because of Franco's victory, and Spanish supplies during WW2 helped the Nazi war machine in its conquests throughout Europe. As well as gave them a crucial testing ground for their tactics and weapons. 


It's clear, that Fascism breeds more fascism. The elections of 2022 will have consequences for not just the US, but the wider world. Not voting isn't just actively harmful to yourself. But it's saying that you, a citizen of the wealthiest country in the world, also don't care about the people of other countries, in danger from their own domestic fascists, or the fascists of neighbouring countries coming to ravage them. Maybe you don't believe that Biden will do enough. But if you believe at all in human rights and solidarity, you should vote! If you believe in a liveable planet, you should vote! If you want to prevent a Third World War, Vote!",Fascist victories beget more fascism.,1667678652,"Fascist victories beget more fascism. Warning Long Post.

Riot police breaking up demonstrations in Lula strongholds. Bolsonaro for years clearly thought he could withstand internal opposition to a coup. But he backed down when it was clear he would have to face opposition internally, as well as international opposition. 

Also on Earth Two, the [Russia-Ukraine war has continued in its escalated form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine). Fierce fighting has continued to ravage the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv as Russia seeks to tighten the pocket around the city, while Russian forces are battling in Odesa, attempting to seize the final pieces of the Ukrainian coastline. Russia has aside from a few small pockets, secured all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper river. [Horror stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) of[ mass graves](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2022/09/22/new-mass-graves-found-in-ukraine-as-putins-atrocities-continue/?sh=2457f14758ba), [executions](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/olga-sukhenko-ukraine-mayor-russia-accused-killing-torture/) and [kidnappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#:~:text=During%20the%202022%20Russian%20invasion,adopted%20to%20the%20Russian%20Federation.) have trickled out from behind Russian lines, but the reporting situation is confused, with Russian state media and affiliates, as well as a cross-partisan coalition of Republicans and [some so-called Leftists](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/yjnymt/briahna_joy_gray_is_literally_defending_russian/), [dispute](https://old.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/yl5e9y/david_sacks_a_trumploving_billionaire_is/) the 'EU Line; 

Ukraine has fiercely resisted the full-scale onslaught of Russia's invasion, but the Russian advance, while embarrassed by many blunders has continued to push forward. Ukraine's military situation is desperate as it relies on limited military aid from Europe. However, Europe is caught between the Russian natural gas blackmail and the indifferent US. US aid to Ukraine was limited to a token package of humanitarian aid after Donald Trump successfully vetoed military aid packages crafted by Democrats and Senate Republicans, and their veto override failed in the House due to Republican votes. Zelenskyy from the relocated capital in Lviv in Western Ukraine warns that with the fresh Russian mobilisation, and major shortfalls in military gear, that the Ukrainian lines could rupture, and Russia could advance deep into central Ukraine. Unleashing fresh horrors on the millions of Ukrainians still in their country, and leaving the millions that have already escaped to Europe homeless. 

The EU is also under pressure internally, as far-right forces mobilise against being punished for supporting the Ukrainian lost cause, and the millions of refugees created by the conflict. Hate crimes have spiked and support for helping Ukraine has steadily fallen. Italy, Hungary and Sweden have all officially cut off aid to Ukraine, and further elections could see a number of European countries fall out of the coalition, as more far-right governments are elected.

**Non-Hypotheticals**

Of course, Earth-Two, is just a Hypothetical, even if I do think it is a highly accurate portrayal of what would be in the cards if Donald Trump got his second term. And could still be in the cards if he wins in 2024.

But we also have real-world examples. For the last time, we had an international collection of fascists collaborating together. [The Spanish Civil War saw fierce fighting between the Nationalists and Republicans.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War) The Nationalists won, thanks to decisive support from the German and Italian fascist governments.

If Germany had beaten back Nazism in the early 1930s, then the Nationalists would have had almost no hope of actually winning the war against the Republicans. The revolts by the army were beaten back in most of Spain's major cities. While Franco's elite units were stationed in Spanish North Africa. The Nationalists attempted to gain control of the Spanish navy, but their crews revolted against their officers, blockading the Army of Africa.

[But then German planes were used to ferry over the Nationalist Troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Africa_\(Spain\)#Role_in_the_Spanish_Civil_War).

[The Nazis supplied the Condor Legion to Spain, helping to secure air superiority over the Republican Forces and bomb their cities flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condor_Legion). [They supplied massive amounts of aid, training, and gear and encouraged the Italians to boost their own aid to Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_involvement_in_the_Spanish_Civil_War). As well as discouraged Western Aid to the Spanish Republicans, leaving them in the lopsided position of their enemy receiving lavish aid, while they were cut off, save for a mercenary USSR. Spain bleed because of Franco's victory, and Spanish supplies during WW2 helped the Nazi war machine in its conquests throughout Europe. As well as gave them a crucial testing ground for their tactics and weapons. 


It's clear, that Fascism breeds more fascism. The elections of 2022 will have consequences for not just the US, but the wider world. Not voting isn't just actively harmful to yourself. But it's saying that you, a citizen of the wealthiest country in the world, also don't care about the people of other countries, in danger from their own domestic fascists, or the fascists of neighbouring countries coming to ravage them. Maybe you don't believe that Biden will do enough. But if you believe at all in human rights and solidarity, you should vote! If you believe in a liveable planet, you should vote! If you want to prevent a Third World War, Vote!"

Is the true danger of fascism today in its current form the fact that it can fit itself into the framework of democracy? Just look at its current iteration in Italy and arguably now in Israel also. These parties won‚Äôt move to go all of the way into banning democracy outright like in the 20th century. There is something very insidious about the populist right that although they introduce dangerous extremist rhetoric and the language of radical action I don‚Äôt think they will go all the way at least not until they have poured enough corrosive acid over the institutions and safeguards of democracy to let them whither away.

Something Steve Bannon said once to this effect is that he considers himself a Leninist, that he wants to tear down the existing state. The whole point of a democracy is to facilitate a progression through it without mass upheaval by maintaining order through peaceful transition of power. What is frightening is seeing democracy as a tool to fascists and in a way like Lenin said about communism that state will whither away when the state has gone through its socialist stage.

The international right is perversely like an inverted communist internationale all working towards the same goal it would seem. The common thread being that there is a globalist conspiracy to undermine national sovereignty and to open up borders.

Unions of over 400k have stated intention to strike. With others of over 1 million members stating at least strong support (unclear if striking, also unsure if 1m group includes the 400k).

It's setting up the EU as a paramount of democracy, the polar opposite of authoritarianism. As a citzen of this organisation this just isn't true. We should not glorify it.

Tell this the EU states that run inhumane refugee camps at its borders. 

Tell this to the governments within the EU that make it illegal to save refugees from drowning and don't face any opposition from the EU government for it. 

Tell this to the EU which made a deal with the dictator of Turkey to keep refugees away from the EU borders. 

Tell this the same EU that just watched as Hungary and Poland slipped deeper and deeper into authoritarianism. That only now tries to contain Orban's fascism, now that it's already to late. 

Tell this to the past governments of Germany, one of the leading countries in the EU, which didn't do shit against the energy dependency on Russia because ""cheap gas and oil"". 

Tell this to German chancellor OLaf Scholz who just sold a large part of the harbour in Hamburg to China. 

Tell this to the EU which again did nothing when most companies moved production to China, which tried to improve the trade relations with one of the most authoriatarian countries on earth to make a profit despite a literal genocide taking place there. 

And now this exact same organisation watches again watches as fascism rises in Italy and Sweden, not defending democracy while its leaders congratulate fascist politicians to their elections.

As we know Russia accused Ukraine of planning to use a dirty bomb in the last few weeks, off-course there is no evidence for this and it falls under the classic Russian playbook of using a false flag and blaming the other side for their actions.

Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario, has used the notwithstanding clause in Canadian/Ontario law to override the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada to enforce a union contract on striking workers.   


He is enforcing fines of 4000 dollars a day on striking workers and 500k a day on the union in question, CUPE. 

He is attempted to force educational workers out of striking, but they have vowed to strike anyways. At this point, a second union, OPSEU has joined the strike. These are wildcat strikes, they have been declared illegal by the government but are happening anyways, and right now in Ontario all educational unions, including teachers unions, contracts are on the table. This has the potential or sprawling into some really intense stuff.

65,VaushV,"I feel like the biggest problem with almost every political discussion is that they tend to always focus on the bullshit surrounding an issue without actually talking about the issue at all.  And then you have these huge debates about all these related things while completely ignoring the problem at hand and thus solving nothing.

Here are a few examples of this that I‚Äôve seen often:

First, BLM.  Nearly all debates about BLM I see nowadays focus on the riots.  Did the left support the riots?  How much damage did the riots cause?  Who was responsible for the riots?

When the real discussion that should be had is whether the BLM protests had a legitimate point.  And I think the answer here is obviously yes.  And the reality is that no matter how many riots happened, the cause was still valid.  So all the discussion about the riots is just a meaningless distraction.

Second Jan 6.  Most of the discussion about Jan 6 is about the particulars of what happened during the actual insurrection.  Was it an insurrection?  Did the police ‚Äúlet them in?‚Äù  Was it really bad or just a bunch of tourists?  Isn‚Äôt this nothing compared to what the left did with BLM?

When the real discussion should be about why these people decided to storm the capital in the first place.  And the answer is they did it because of deliberate lies told by prominent GOP politicians and the president.  Once again, this is the issue, all that other crap is a distraction.

Like Vaush says if you have suicidal ideations or have attempted in the past you may not want immediate access or choose to not own one at all and that is a personal decision that I understand. However, even if you choose not to have a gun, and especially if you do, anyone can and should own medical gear that will hold you over until you or people you can help are able to get to a hospital or an ambulance gets to them. If you own a gun a great starting place is an IFAK. MyMedic makes a good consumer-friendly version called the ""TFAK"" which is currently on sale for Cyber Monday. But there are many options that give you the essentials for cheaper. I've heard North American Rescue I've heard is another great source for medical supplies but has too many options to the point where I was confused when I started looking into kits.   
These kits have what you need to stop bleeding from bullet wounds or other heavy bleeding incidents. Including a tourniquet for cutting off circulation to an arm or leg, and gauze and bandages meant to stop heavy bleeding. Just these can be life-saving in situations where someone is bleeding out.   
Getting a more advanced kit is also a great idea for emergency situations like political violence or even just natural disasters where help may be days or weeks from reaching you, I.E. hurricanes, blizzards, large-scale power outages from storms, severe flooding, etc.   


Beau of the Fifth column has some videos recommending what to have in preparedness kits for these situations including med kits if you're interested. I'm not suggesting we all start prepping like right-wingers do, as they often go to extremes and just end up hoarding resources. But having what you need to survive a few days or weeks depending on where you live can be the difference between life and death. You are also currently more likely to find someone that's been in a car accident that you can save from bleeding out than you are to be in a situation where you can save someone by using a gun.

174,VaushV,"So I‚Äôve seen a lot of this community use the term genocide loosely. From a post describing the way society treats the neurodivergent, to also how trans people are suffering an on-going genocide.

I‚Äôm going to focus on the trans side of this because it‚Äôs the most pressing, in that society being unaccommodating is clearly not genocide, and I say that as an autist. 

First I want to say that I absolutely agree that if the right wing in the United States gain power there‚Äôs the possibility, especially if democracy is taken away. That being said none of the points being made that people point to as being genocide are strong enough to be considered so. Sporadic acts of violence to not equate to genocide. Systemic discrimination does not equate to genocide either. Looking throughout history, there are cases of egregious discrimination that don‚Äôt rise to genocide, for example Jews in historical Europe. For centuries they suffered pogroms, hundreds killed at a time, but this still does not fit the definition of genocide, despite violence being inflicted, and then being discriminated against grossly, kept out of certain professions, and their ability to worship being limited.

The term genocide was formed in the aftermath of the Armenian genocide and also the Holocaust. It‚Äôs necessary to want to destroy in part or in whole a group. And destroy here does mean kill. And through direct means, not suicide. The death marches the Armenians were sent on without adequate food or water, the shootings and death camps the Nazis created. 

Culturally destroying also does not suffice to call it a genocide, that would be a cultural genocide, and there‚Äôs certainly more of an open question on that as individual states bring in laws designed to limit how trans people can express themselves, and to attempt to keep them from coming out.

While it may seem nitpicky to take issue with the word genocide being used to describe right now, I really don‚Äôt believe it is. The word is extremely important and needs to retain its meaning, in much the same way the right devalues pedo and groomer constantly by just throwing it out there. (this is of course a much bigger issue due to how they use it, and how they use it to try to dehumanise an entire group of people is the bigger issue, but it being devalued is still an important issue, it‚Äôs also entirely dishonest when the right uses pedo and groomer, it is not, I believe, dishonest here but merely a misunderstanding of the term)

I fully agree that should the right overthrow democracy and act as autocratically as they want, things could devolve into being a genocide. But we‚Äôre not at that point yet, and that‚Äôs important because it means we shouldn‚Äôt be using that language to describe the current situation, and we should remember it isn‚Äôt *at all* inevitable. It‚Äôs still something that can be fought. 

Some people might ask why I care so much and I‚Äôd understand that perspective, but the biggest reason is WWII was my radicalising event, or rather WWII documentaries. As a kid I always loved engineering, and would watch stuff on planes tanks whatever, and soon that translated into other aspects, such as the Holocaust. This was before I was a teen. As I got older I realised the link between history and politics, and wanted to ensure we learned from our mistakes, and I studied political theory and public policy at university, and I‚Äôm now 25. Genocide has an *extremely* high bar to clear, and has to show the purposeful intent to kill a group in whole or in part, and in substantial numbers, through conditions that are either unsurvivable, like starvation, long death marches, crowded conditions leading to disease, or direct killings.

This *does not* mean I care less about what‚Äôs happening to trans people daily in the US. But I also deeply care that the word genocide is kept for times when it is desperately needed, including for future use when it may be reoccurring. Despite my broadly anti-gun stance, I also do not blame anyone at this point for arming themselves should things devolve. Don‚Äôt mistake my reticence for caring deeply about what is and what is not genocide for not caring about trans people and their well being, that really is not the case.",Genocide,1669575150,"Genocide So I‚Äôve seen a lot of this community use the term genocide loosely.

I‚Äôm going to focus on the trans side of this because it‚Äôs the most pressing, in that society being unaccommodating is clearly not genocide, and I say that as an autist. 

First I want to say that I absolutely agree that if the right wing in the United States gain power there‚Äôs the possibility, especially if democracy is taken away. That being said none of the points being made that people point to as being genocide are strong enough to be considered so. Sporadic acts of violence to not equate to genocide. Systemic discrimination does not equate to genocide either. Looking throughout history, there are cases of egregious discrimination that don‚Äôt rise to genocide, for example Jews in historical Europe. For centuries they suffered pogroms, hundreds killed at a time, but this still does not fit the definition of genocide, despite violence being inflicted, and then being discriminated against grossly, kept out of certain professions, and their ability to worship being limited.

The term genocide was formed in the aftermath of the Armenian genocide and also the Holocaust. It‚Äôs necessary to want to destroy in part or in whole a group. And destroy here does mean kill. And through direct means, not suicide. The death marches the Armenians were sent on without adequate food or water, the shootings and death camps the Nazis created. 

Culturally destroying also does not suffice to call it a genocide, that would be a cultural genocide, and there‚Äôs certainly more of an open question on that as individual states bring in laws designed to limit how trans people can express themselves, and to attempt to keep them from coming out.

While it may seem nitpicky to take issue with the word genocide being used to describe right now, I really don‚Äôt believe it is. The word is extremely important and needs to retain its meaning, in much the same way the right devalues pedo and groomer constantly by just throwing it out there. (this is of course a much bigger issue due to how they use it, and how they use it to try to dehumanise an entire group of people is the bigger issue, but it being devalued is still an important issue, it‚Äôs also entirely dishonest when the right uses pedo and groomer, it is not, I believe, dishonest here but merely a misunderstanding of the term)

I fully agree that should the right overthrow democracy and act as autocratically as they want, things could devolve into being a genocide. But we‚Äôre not at that point yet, and that‚Äôs important because it means we shouldn‚Äôt be using that language to describe the current situation, and we should remember it isn‚Äôt *at all* inevitable. It‚Äôs still something that can be fought. 

Some people might ask why I care so much and I‚Äôd understand that perspective, but the biggest reason is WWII was my radicalising event, or rather WWII documentaries. As a kid I always loved engineering, and would watch stuff on planes tanks whatever, and soon that translated into other aspects, such as the Holocaust. This was before I was a teen. As I got older I realised the link between history and politics, and wanted to ensure we learned from our mistakes, and I studied political theory and public policy at university, and I‚Äôm now 25. Genocide has an *extremely* high bar to clear, and has to show the purposeful intent to kill a group in whole or in part, and in substantial numbers, through conditions that are either unsurvivable, like starvation, long death marches, crowded conditions leading to disease, or direct killings.

This *does not* mean I care less about what‚Äôs happening to trans people daily in the US. But I also deeply care that the word genocide is kept for times when it is desperately needed, including for future use when it may be reoccurring. Despite my broadly anti-gun stance, I also do not blame anyone at this point for arming themselves should things devolve. Don‚Äôt mistake my reticence for caring deeply about what is and what is not genocide for not caring about trans people and their well being, that really is not the case."

[Here](https://mtracey.substack.com/p/a-fairy-tale-version-of-world-war?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2) it is. He treats the Holocaust as something that spiraled out of control once the US entered WWII. This *superficially* resembles a school of thought called [""functionalism.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism%E2%80%93intentionalism_debate), but no functionalist historian argues that ""the Allies provoked Germany into killing the Jews."" That's just Tracey.

It's **long**. The first half claims that Roosevelt used a salami-slicing strategy to get the US public ready for war. Michael focuses on the same things as in the debate: Lend-Lease, Iceland, those 3 naval clashes in the fall of 1941, and the oil embargo on Japan.

*That* bit--that FDR wanted to intervene, but knew that he'd have to build the public's support--is believable. FDR wanted to do the right thing, and despite tough circumstances, he found a way to do it. In my book, that makes him a great president.

Tracey then focuses on ""terror bombings"" like Dresden, as Nazi sympathizers are wont to do. Interestingly, while he larps as a functionalist about the Holocaust, he's downright intentionalist about the Allied bombing campaigns (emphasis mine):

&gt; There is no coherent way to separate the justifiability of these deliberate, civilian-targeting aerial bombardment campaigns from the justifiability of entering the war. Because a foundational feature of the war was these deliberate civilian-targeting aerial bombardment campaigns. **""Deliberate, civilian-targeting aerial bombardment campaigns"" are no more separable from World War II than [...] ""house frame"" is separable from ""house.""**

He's slimy and dishonest here too. Take this:

&gt; The first ‚Äúcity bombing attack‚Äù conducted by British forces was in Mannheim, Germany on December 16, 1940

He forgets that *Germany had been bombing Britain* since September 1940. The Luftwaffe switched from precision to area bombing within weeks. Coventry was bombed exactly one month before the RAF struck Mannheim. The Nazis called their raids ""Terrorangriffe."" Literally, ""terror attacks.""

Coventry wasn't even the first. In May 1940, the Nazis did [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_bombing_of_Rotterdam) to Rotterdam. The Nazis then told the Dutch that more cities would be bombed unless the Dutch surrendered. That's the most explicit ""terror bombing"" of the war, done by the Nazis, less than a year into the war.

You may now quote Bomber Harris.

He's also ignorant about basic philosophy regarding war:

&gt; There‚Äôs a conceit that the manner in which a war is conducted can somehow be separated, in terms of moral judgment, from whether launching the war was justified. 

This ""conceit"" is called the *jus ad bellum* versus *jus in bello* distinction. Thomas Aquinas wrote about it in the 13th century. Almost every philosopher since Aquinas has recognized it.

**Holocaust Denial Starts Here**

After **seven thousand words**, Tracey finally says what he wanted to say: that maybe if the US had sat WWII out, there would've been no Holocaust. He starts with an ""I'm not racist, but"" disclaimer:

&gt; I have never claimed, nor am I claiming here, that the US ‚Äúcaused‚Äù the Holocaust, or that Nazi Germany bears any less responsibility for the Holocaust [...] What I‚Äôm saying is this: there is ample reason to believe [...] that US entry to World War II coincided with ‚Äî and may well have been a motivating factor in ‚Äî the acceleration of the most lethal phase of the Holocaust.

He cites mainstream historians, but he does so dishonestly (eg, turning ""could have been"" statements into ""was""), and the way he uses sources is absurd. The worst is when he misuses this quote by Daniel Rafecas of Yad Vashem (emphasis is mine):

&gt; By the fall of 1941 the Nazis [did not have] the required means to undertake a last stage to the Final Solution. In November 1941, the only facilities under construction designed to serve that end were **the gas vans in Chelmno and the three gas chambers at Belzec**.

There it is: Holocaust denial. **Tracey is writing off Chelmno and Belzec.** This is **fucking crazy**. Those camps' existence proves that the Nazis had genocidal intent by 1941. Their sole purpose was to kill every inmate on arrival:

* Chelmno had 7 known survivors out of 150,000 to 200,000 murders.

* Belzec had 7 known survivors out of **400,000 to 500,000 murders.**

Tracey also mentions the factoid that the Shoah's first gassings happened at Chelmno on Dec. 8, 1941. It's clear what he's doing. He's implying causality, as if the Nazis decided to start gassing the Jews overnight.

Some of his sources are just bizarre. His citations include:

* Heinrich Himmler's Posen speech, in which Himmler congratulated himself for preventing ""sabotage"" by slaughtering the Jews en masse.

* Hitler's 1939 prediction that if war broke out in Europe, the Jews would be ""annihilated."" Which, as Vaush mentioned, Hitler made 9 months before starting a war in Europe.

* [This highlighted passage](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6b5a1e9-17c8-47e6-8824-2386149d7648_1200x803.png). Hitler attributed the new US-Soviet alliance as proof that the Jews controlled both DC and Moscow.

I'd argue that if the Nazis could rationalize the Shoah this easily, then genocide was inevitable. It was only a matter of finding the right excuse.

---

That's enough of Tracey's statements. Now I'll focus on some things that he conspicuously *doesn't* mention.

He says nothing about the Warsaw Ghetto, which was built in October 1940, when FDR was still promising neutrality.

He doesn't mention the Nazis' genocides of non-Jews. Take the Intelligenzaktion. The Nazis shot about 100,000 Polish intellectuals, army officers, civil servants, writers, priests, and anyone else who might've kept Polish culture alive. They started this as soon as they invaded, and completed it by the end of 1940.

He says almost nothing about Operation Barbarossa, which the Nazis launched 3 months before the USS Greer incident.

The word ""Einsatzgruppe"" doesn't appear once.

He doesn't mention the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, which the SS called to tell the rest of the Nazi state about what it had already decided to do.

He doesn't mention the Baltics, where the Nazis encouraged local vigilantes to kill Jews in mobs starting in July.

He also doesn't mention Babi Yar. That must've stung him. While Mariupol was being destroyed he wouldn't shut up about ""Ukro-nazis."" But it happened in September 1941, which is inconveniently early for his thesis.

All of this, of course, happened after the Nazis had invaded and annexed neighboring countries. That's a crime in its own right, but it doesn't bother Tracey.

God, writing this made me angry. Tracey's very proposal is repugnant. By his own admission, the Holocaust was underway long before the US and Germany fired shots. He's just JAQing off that *maybe* a monstrous, genocidal regime would've killed fewer people if the US had let it do whatever it wanted.

If you know the Kyle lore well you know he has a lot of stuff in common with Shoe that lefties don't like. He had a pretty heated argument with Vaush because Kyle was being a labor reductionist or whatever that term is. He hardly apologized for that or walked it back if at all. As far as I know he is still friends with Jimmy Dore. Or at least he hardly if ever really criticized him except for Jimmy criticized Kyle he responded to that. He burned the TYT bridge for Jimmy.

He is a ""free speech absolutist"" just like Shoe. He loves to talk about the ""deep state"" controlling the US. I trying to remember everything but I'm sure there's stuff I'm forgetting.

424,VaushV,"As of late, I've moved to watch more Xanderhal because he is honestly one of the most insightful lefty content creators out there.  He's positive, high energy and overall it is criminal that he has as few subs as he does.  He is genuinely a fun guy to listen to and watch and He has much better intuition about politics than people twice his age and experience.  He is a bit rough around the edges due to a lack of formal education in sociology, politics, or economics but he has a great sense of understanding where the country is going and some good ways of taking action.

This got me thinking about Vaush and why I'm watching less of his content.  Lately, Vaush feels very low energy, dismissive, and disinterested on stream.  It feels like he doesn't even want to stream anymore.  It's almost like he feels like he has given up against the fascists and is just trying to brace for the storm once it hits.  He is basically not talking about political issues anymore and every response to political issues is ""Buy guns, update passport, seek community.""  This is all good advice but isn't really very insightful or interesting.  It doesn't provide anything actionable it makes me feel like I'm a doomsday prepper. 

I'm constantly thinking to myself ""No wonder his community is so doomer everything lately feels so negative and hopeless (Don't be Doomer, do as he says not as he appears). The stream is mostly him just vibing with chat, playing games, and looking at shitty tweets from the Elonosphere (Right-Wing Twitter). It feels just so depressing and like there is no agency except in being prepared for violence.  I understand that violence at this point is inevitable but we have to be able to do more than just wait for the shots to be fired.  This prepper shit isn't helpful to anyone's mental health, I feel like I'm going crazy and at this point, I understand why conservatives go crazy because when you aren't being active in building a better community or world and instead are waiting for the worst you get antsy and you start going crazy.

All analysis, positivity, actionability, and curiosity seem to have vanished from the streams.  Vaush is constantly arguing with chat about dumb shit, he appears more depressed, irritable, disengaged, and hopeless while on stream but he is constantly in Twitter beef with right-wingers. It's like non-stop how much he has been tweeting lately to idiots who will never respond back to him. It's like he has lost all love for streaming or doing politics which feels to me why he has stopped doing interesting content and instead gives the same ""Buy Guns, etc."" Response rather than actually engaging and being a positive force.

I'm not in Vaush's head so I can't say for certain how he feels but to me, it just feels like he wants to vibe, play games, and do media/games stuff.  Which is fine.  I would only say that he needs to really think about what he wants and he needs to rebrand accordingly.  For those of us more interested in doing more political stuff, he should redirect us toward Xan if he wants to get out of the politics game.  I can understand that politics burns you out and it is hard to be positive and high energy in these dark times but hope is what gets people through the worst.  Optimism for a better future is what pushes the Ukrainian people it energizes them and makes push for a better future.  Something to hope for is essential to building good political movements. I think Vaush has lost that from my personal observation which is why his content has stagnated and he hasn't been doing as much good content has stagnated for the past year.  He is doing a little better recently but I honestly think that is mostly due to Elon, Twitter, and Ukraine stuff and not because of the general direction of the content.

anyway, that is my personal analysis. I hope vaush is feeling okay.  I do enjoy his content overall but It has just taken a noticeable tonal shift and his former confident and positive personality has given way to a more negative one.  Perhaps it's because he has lost so many friends and he needs more lefty friends.

460,VaushV,"This post was inspired by a conversation I've had with friends regarding conservatives' reaction to the last two election cycles. We've all seen the maps where a swathe of red counties end up losing to only a handful or blue ones- leaving conservatives perpetually dumbfounded and angry because they can't possibly image more people living in cities.

It's a silly question in the grand scheme of things- but what happens when this perpetual situation becomes rebranded as a from of 'neo-imperalism'? 

You have a population center living possibly hundreds of miles away from you -who dont share the same needs or views as you- dictating laws and legislation that end up affecting *you*, and no amount of voting against it will seemingly work- as there simply is more of them than you. Of course, this is simple democracy, but It *can* be an understandable situation. Living in NY for example, upstate NY always feels like it's beholden to the population of NYC above all else.

Reading about the concept of 'popular sovereignty' and the 'internal colonies', I'm concerned that the current conservative talking points about this may coalesce into a core ideology/platform in the future. One that may end up appealing to Hinkle-style ""leftists"" who latch onto the 'anti-imperalism' rhetoric of it. And if so, any violent 'resistance' by them will become branded as a ""struggle"" to them. Laws and enforcement resulting from their actions will be waved off by them as ""oppression"" and blatantly opposed.

This *is* already happening, but I genuinely fear what will happen if this becomes the hot, new thing they end up latching onto above all else.

This post was inspired by a conversation I've had with friends regarding conservatives' reaction to the last two election cycles. We've all seen the maps where a swathe of red counties end up losing to only a handful or blue ones- leaving conservatives perpetually dumbfounded and angry because they can't possibly image more people living in cities.

461,VaushV,"So I get why fighting to get as many people on the left is a positive thing, and Shoe is a person who has a large following. But I guess my question at this point would be similar to, ""Can someone help me understand the argument of why fighting to bring Dave Rubin to the left is a net positive?"" I've had a therapist in my past tell me that they couldn't work harder than me when it comes to our treatment. And at this point, Shoe feels like she's clawing and kicking and screaming to go over to the reactionary conspiratorial side and it's people on the left trying to hold her by her leg while she's kicking them in the face.

I would get it if she has an open forum on her twitter and maintains a left-leaning audience. But no, she blocks every liberal and leftist in sight who dares to criticize her, but maintains a nazi audience because she thinks it's funny according to Xan. So she's actively cultivating a right-leaning audience and follows several dangerous accounts like Libs of Tiktok.

Even her videos are starting to swing in the other direction. They've always maintained a reactionary sort of vibe in terms of her presentation, but she released a video recently about why ""misinformation is good actually"". Followed shortly by trying to advocate for Alex Jones to be re-platformed (A reminder that Alex Jones spread conspiracies about the Sandy Hook shootings to such a degree, that several parents moved and one father took his own life because he couldn't handle the lost of his child and the harassment).

And at this point, Vaush's reactions almost feel like being gaslit primarily because I've seen him go harder towards people who have essentially been on our side but imperfect. Full disclosure, I was coming off of being a fan of Krystal and Saagar's show (forgot what the first iteration was called now) when Vaush started covering them. And Vaush went SO hard against Krystal and I thought it was weird. I agree that Krystal's belief of aligning with someone on ""the new right"" to spread populist ideas is a terrible idea. But I've seen Krystal push back **hard** against Saagar. She advocates for leftist beliefs on twitter, she made Bill Maher look like an idiot on his own show by arguing for leftist beliefs, she very clearly. At face value, she appears to be someone who tries to be an ally with flawed beliefs and executions (When you dig into her it's a little more iffy, but mainly speaking from the perspective of Vaush's initial take which was just seeing her on the show with Saagar). Meanwhile, Shoe is like a monkey with a loaded handgun who has shot a few people and Vaush is standing by, rubbing his temple going ""What do you want me to do? It's a monkey. I know it's bad, I've said it's bad, but it's a monkey.""

His argument about treating her like it's your racist grandpa doesn't stand either because our racist grandpas don't have megaphones with people standing by listening to them and waiting to go into action depending on what they have to say. And even if they did, I would have to come out against my racist grandpa. If Christian Walker (of all people) can do it, then so can I.

I guess I just don't understand why there have been any arguments that she's someone worth trying to hold onto when she's someone who's cultivating a right-wing audience, following right-wing people, dating someone on the right, who believes in conspiratorial right-wing ideas, and has been confirmed by several people who know her personally not to listen to any sort of criticism. Again, I'd get it if she was an individual or if she continued to maintain a left-wing audience, but it feels as though she's been running to the right since Biden was elected.",Can someone help me understand the argument of why fighting to keep Shoe on the left is a net positive?,1669206771,"Can someone help me understand the argument of why fighting to keep Shoe on the left is a net positive?

462,VaushV,"Vaush's content for the past 6 months has been a non-stop campaign of fearmongering and it's getting tiring. He offers very shallow analysis of what he covers and the message always is that you're gonna end up in a concentration camp. And even when something positive happens, he either dismisses it as an unimportant victory or as something that will only buy a bit of time before everything collapses.

Don't get me wrong, I do realise the threat that america faces from the republicans, but what vaush is doing is completely irrational. Not only is america far from a guaranteed dissolution of it's democracy by the republicans, but even if that happens, concentration camps and genocides are very unlikely ( just look at russia or belarus, two much more homophobic and fascistic countries, which aren't doing and never did do a genocide against LGBTQ+ people).

I watched him for his deep and well thought analysis on subjects he covered, but nowadays it's just shallow fearmongering.

That's the interpretation that he has doubled down on with the faintest shreds of evidence

The primary problem with Dan Schneider wasn't the weird episodes of icarly, it was that he was abusing people and the weird episodes were a red flag that people put together after the abuse had been known. The red flag in this case is a stuffed animal with a leather harness being held by a child in a normal dress.  Dan Schneider's were actually making children be a part of his sexual life and making images sexualizing them. If a child holding a bear with vague sexy gear in order to sell that product is the justification for calling someone a pedo, then half of the video games is pedo stuff, wrestling is pedo stuff, cartoons are pedo stuff.

He has already admitted that he has to tread lightly because of personal relationships, which is his prerogative, but him needing to also be right is making him do messed up thing like accusing someone of being a pedo with almost no evidence. Doesn't he know how that feels?

The likely answer to why Balenciaga is removing it might have something to do with not wanting to be included in this ongoing wave of violence that the right is pretending is about protecting children from abuse.

540,VaushV,"Firstly, let's clear up what the balenciaga situation is.
Balenciaga got photographer Gabriele Galimberti (who's famous for his ""Toy stories"" series in which he photographs children all around the world with their toys and posts them on his Instagram) to do some photoshoots with children with child toys and some balenciaga brand items/clothes. Two of those photoshoots show a girl holding teddy bear hand bags, one of them is in a kind of goth style dressed in gothic clothing /items and the other seems to be wearing a bdsm esque cross strap, which is indeed weird but most likely just is a dog harness since you can see the same girl in the same  room with the same teddy bear in another photoshoot about pet/dog items, (I'm talking about the teddy bear hand bags). On a completely separate disconnected photoshoot balenciaga did like a messy desk job/profesional job photoshoot in which they printed a bunch of court papers it seems to use as props. Well one of those papers was about virtual cp (the paper was an anti-cp case btw). Now that we're caught up let's see what Shoeonhead said/did.

She made a conspiratorial tweet insinuating that those 2 photoshoots with the teddy bears are pedophilic and connected to the other photoshoot with the desk and papers (they are not). She then says that the virtual cp court paper (which is anti-cp) was purposefully poorly hidden into the photoshoot. This is completely unsupported, she has no reason or evidence to make such a heavy conspiratorial claim. This conspiracy of ""they/the elite have to tell the truth""/""hiding the truth in plain sight"" that Shoeonhead is pushing in that post is nothing new. It's an extremely common far-right/antisemitic conspiracy that states that the elite are hiding subliminal messages to program the masses and that they have to tell/show the truth to avoid karmic consequences. I'm not saying she's far-right or antisemitic, I'm just stating what she is doing/seems to be doing intentionally or not.

Under her tweet she posted an image showing that balenciaga left twitter to protest elons takeover of Twitter and another image saying ""why are you running"" with a caption ""interesting timing"" insinuating that balenciaga left twitter due to the whole supposed pedophilia thing, again another unsupported conspiracy brained take. And underneath that she says ""THEY DELETED ALL THEIR INSTAGRAM POSTS LMAO"" with an image showing exactly that, clearly insinuating that again they did that due to the whole supposed pedophilia thing (again another unsupported conspiracy brained take), but the thing is that if she took 5 seconds to Google search ""why did balenciaga delete their Instagram posts"" (less time then it would have taken for her to write that tweet) she would have found out that balenciaga has done that multiple times before, such as in 2021, and that it's some kind of symbolic/ceremonial thing they do when another person is in charge or they're in a new ""chapter"" of sorts. But no, she chose to stick to her insane  unsupported conspiracy theory.

And I know that she knows all of this because she blocked a person that had replied to merricks reply to her tweet which was saying most of the things that I explained here, meaning that she saw merricks post. So she clearly knows she's wrong, but despite that she has said nothing, she has retracted nothing, and she has deleted nothing. 

Her comments are filled with other even worse conspiracy brained far-right people spewing their own bullshit with lots of likes. And I've found multiple articles (mostly right-wing) showing/quoting her tweet saying the same things as her and showing other people's tweets from terfs and other right wingers. 

She's completely irresponsible and unreliable, she doesn't seem to care or understand the truth and she's completely conspiracy brained. And Vaush should call her out and make it clear to everyone, and hold her accountable for her misinformation. He needs to treat her like he would treat any other dumbass, and he should also start doing more research when talking about stuff.

Online lefties are helping the right perpetuate wonderful queer people like my friends who I adore are pedophiles. Shoe simply posted a tweet about capitalists being pedos. Yes most capitalists are pedophiles.

 And the online left basically said any attack on capitalist pedophiles is an attack on the queer community.

I know that the shooting of a queer club recently happened and the right wing (a bunch of pedophiles) immediately jumped to subtlety and explicitly jumped to tie a tweet about capitalist pedophiles to the queer community but the left just helped them have that narrative.

The left blacked up that narrative that the queer community is a bunch of pedophiles. If you get mad at someone for tweeting about capitalist pedophiles immediately after someone shot up a queer club you're helping to make that connection.

How have pedophiles (the right wing) convinced the left to get mad at people for talking about capitalist pedophiles? This doesn't happen the other way around. This is so fucking backwards. 

It's ok to get mad at Shoe she's an incredibly insecure retard. But she never did anything to make any connection between the queer community and pedophila. Not nearly as much as online leftists and rightoids have. Everyone around her has. Left and right. 

How the online left is reacting now is the same as how they would react if they supported MAPs are part of the queer community.

Holy shit think about that. The left has to be careful about how and when they talk about pedophiles but the right (pedophiles) can talk about it how and whenever they want? Who seems like the guilty side then?

571,VaushV,"Why?

Because a hell of a lot of what Vaush does is ""affect"" work. He cathartically takes apart things that are obviously wrong, but that people want to be shown to be wrong by someone with a big enough and confrontational enough personality that they can feel a kind of relief that someone sees what they see.

-

When he debates someone, many in the audience don't just want him to be right, they want him to generally undermine someone who is saying terrible and/or reprehensible things, whether that's on trans issues or Ukraine, where people present themselves as being reasonable rational people just asking questions, and he digs into the underlying emotional stakes that *should* come along with what they are discussing. Regardless of how they see themselves, the consequences of their actions or arguments entail a set of emotionally resonant consequences that he brings to the surface.

One side of what Vaush does is argument, about trying to take apart what people are saying, but another side is vitriol, about pushing against their public persona and self-image, and people want a bit of that.

For example, is Shoeonhead genocidal, because whatever she believes, she supports outcomes that lead towards genocide? That's certainly what Vaush has said in the past.

And people have felt safer, and felt vindicated, because there is someone able to say that about ""conservatives"" generally.

Because how much of the anti-trans propaganda is being shared by some concerned mother on a pro-life facebook group or whatsapp channel worried about safety for her kids, and not being responsible about checking what she puts out?

And if that is a problem, how much more does that apply, to someone who is becoming a central organising node for the propaganda network that sells that ""sensationalist child protection clickbait -&gt; anti-trans groomer rhetoric -&gt; active stochastic terrorism and general repression"" pipeline.

She is part of the system, and she can reflect on her role, and what she ""doesn't want to be"", and actually *act* on it, or she can self-consciously allow herself to become a part of that.

-

It's obvious that Vaush has certain biases, that there's people he doesn't want to debate because it makes him sad, either because they have had a formative influence on his own political development (Wolff, Chomsky, D) or - particularly at the moment - because he puts more stock in maintaining online friendships, and generally just doesn't want to go hard against people he otherwise likes.

But even if that is acknowledged, but having ""the big cis dude who wants to protect trans people, and goes after those who attack them"", *not* go after someone who is also a strong participant in the same networks as other people he attacks, is jarring and uncomfortable to many people, and naturally so.

In one sense, the answer is simple, you just need more than one Vaush in the space, so that they can each cover what the other won't, with the appropriate scale of reaction.

What you need is some Canadian bearded dude to come out with a big video on Shoe, full of barbed insults and jokes which Vaush reacts to, cringes, laughs, and then is like ""Shoe, what do you want me to say? He's right.."".

This isn't xcom where everyone in your party overwatches things directly behind them, and then all miss and let it through anyway, Vaush has a firing arc, and accepting that and promoting other flawed but potentially helpful people who can cover his blindspots as far as aggression is concerned seems a natural conclusion.",It's actually not surprising that people want Vaush to be more aggressive towards Shoeonhead,1669131209,"It's actually not surprising that people want Vaush to be more aggressive towards Shoeonhead Why?

He said the newest Foals album was ""weak"" and ""took them away from their roots."" He also said their first album was ""still them figuring themselves out"" and ""too emo."" Which like nah.

So I have to say right off the bat that Vaush's handling of these issues isnt bad. He isn't as coy or deflective like some liberals tend to be with issues re muslim countries. He isnt afraid to clearly state that their policies are bad and reactionary and all.

However, i tend to sense a slight disinterestedness in zeroing and focusing in on that in a way similar to how he handles Russia's similar policy choices for example. Like i didn't really like the ""Its our fault"" part he repeated. I mean i get his point but i dont agree that it should ve gotten this much attention over the fact that gulf countries' leaders have a super fucked supremacist attitude towards foreign labour (and the concept of straight up slavery) in their countries, ofc on top of all the other shitty social policies.

I don't work for Mastodon but I helped write and produce the offical Mastodon [YouTube explain-ey video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPSbNdBmWKE).

With respect, I don't think you understand how Mastodon works.

Vaush said: https://youtu.be/173kVaTc0rs?t=416

""Mastodon has like seperate sub-servers that get maintained independently, and then you create threads within them, that's not even...""

That's like half-true but it leaves out the most important part about how Mastodon works. Different mastodon servers are not ""sub servers"" they are literally ""servers"" that anyone- including you, can host. You can run a Mastodon server out of your basement, the source code is public and free to download.

But what makes Mastodon special is that despite running it out of your basement, you can still follow, comment, boost and otherwise interact with anyone else using it. So it's not like a classic ""forum"" where you make your own forum, invite your friends and only you use it. You set it up, invite people in, and then you follow and talk to people *outside* of your server, just like twitter.

So basically, I don't understand why Vaush thinks it isn't a viable alternative to twitter, because it is.

And while I still like Vaush and fully believe he is a leftist, and two years ago his fan base was largely also hardcore leftists, but this subreddit has a problem I see with libs taking it over. 

**The Capitalism Shilling**

I don't know if this is a majority of Vaush fans, but I see a lot of ""socdems"" who are just shills for capitalism. I see people play defense for liberalism, defending capitalism, invasions of other countries, exploitation of those countries. While I don't believe socdems are fascists, they have historically sided with it.

**""Gunz Bad""**

Yeah this is just something that gets on my nerves a little bit. I get you Euros don't understand this but being anti-gun is against all forms of leftism. This is one of the criticisms i see of Vaush from liberals and i see it all the time on this subreddit. 

**Zionism** 

This one I don't understand considering how much advocacy Vaush has done for the Palestinian cause, yet I see his fans use all kind of anti-Palestinian rhetoric. This can range from demonization of the movement, and at worst the full denial of the genocide that is going on. I see many claim israel's ""right to exist"". I constantly see people posting about ""AntI-sEmeTiC anTI-ZioNiSts"". 

**Cop Simping**

Yeah there are people who say you can be a ""leftist cop"" which is dumb, I don't need to explain any further.

So Sahra Wagenknecht -for thos who are fortunate enough to not know her- is a German politican and a member of the Linke a Social Democratic/ Democratic Socialist German party. Her economic positions once were socialist are now Social Democratic, she advocates for a capitalist market economy with strong social security measueres. For this she's hated especially in the party's youth organisation ""solid"" that consists of Marxists, Trotzkists, Anarchists and radical DemSocs.  

However the REALLY problematic part are her opinion on anything else, she dislikes LGBTQ+ people and wants the Linke to drop support for them. She's against humane rufugee policies because she's afraid that it'll hurt Germany. She is against Covid vaccines and mask mandates. She also thinks that the Linke shpuldn't focus on climate policy as much as it does now since she thinks it brings the party ""out of touch"" with the people. And she's also a Russian asset, speaking for Putin, is aginst sanctions, wants usto import gas from Russia, blames NATO and Ukraine for the war etc. 

And yet she is one of the most popular politicians in Germany right now. While Die Linke is horribly unsuccesfull Wagenknechts star continues to rise despite her being an outcast in her own party. Now there's more and more  rumors about her wanting to found an own party. And as polls stand right now she would be at least more succesfull than Linke, FDP (neoliberal party) and AFD (neoliberal fascist party) and maybe could even reach Gr√ºne (green party) and SPD (moderate SocDem party ) levels. 

Obviously there's still a lot of time until the next election for her to fuck up her support, new parties almost never work in Germany since they always lack funding and popularity if they're not a faction in the Bundestag and the poll is phrased in a ""could you imagine"" way which obviously can mean anything to the people voting ""yes"" for example ""I don't like her but if she has good social policies I might vote for her"". Still it's scary how many dumb people we have.

799,VaushV,"Recently on Tiktok, there's a guy who has had a bit of a come-up, he makes little satire music videos. He's used this to try and start a semi-serious music career. One of his songs uses the word bitch a lot and calls someone a bitch. He started getting some criticism for this as the term is seen as misogynistic, he got criticism even from Julia Fox; for those who don't know, Kanye briefly dated her after his divorce from Kim Kardashian. The guy responded to her saying a lot of things, essentially saying it was hypocritical of her to criticise him for being problematic when he dated Kanye during a time where he was harassing Kim and Pete. During this video he does unironically make a few sexist remarks that's led to him getting further criticism, especially since he responded that in his song that uses the term; he is the person who is being referred to, i.e. it is self-referential and he is the bitch.

I don't really care about this though, there was a response video that said Bitch was a slur and it really got me thinking. Should it be seen as one? It's comparing a woman to a dog, it seems like we have a pretty visceral reaction when a man calls a woman a bitch as an insult, similar to other slurs. It's not like cracker because women are a marginalised group. Even using it self-referentially or in reference to someone who's not a women seems problematic because just imagine that but replace bitch with r\*tard, it certainly seems like that wouldn't be okay. So what's the fundamental difference? I don't know what people's reactions are going to be, there may be a lot of ""wokeness has gone too far"" comments, but there are many words which are considered slurs now which were normalised at one point in time. It seems to me like Bitch should be thought of as no different to slurs like the t slur or the r slur.

926,VaushV," The time I was most severely mentally ill was a couple of years ago at the height of my mental confusion, and femininity seemed like it would help me solve my then identity crisis. All it did, and also the reason mental illness I feel is so close to the progressive left is and was because femininity heavily forces social and appearance expectations on people that are incredibly unhealthy, especially on femboy internet groups, whose entire understanding of femininity comes from porn and manga

It encourages anxiety, low confidence, and making yourself weaker which are in any other context terrible, but when presented into a feminine person everyone seems to be fine with it for some reason, weird. Ever since then I've tried to embrace a masculine life of exercise, a healthy diet, and confidence but while I wouldn't exactly call myself any masculine behemoth of man it certainly has helped and I'm frankly the happiest I've ever been in my life right now.

That doesn't mean there isn't some risk of damage. We're talking about paintings that are hundreds of years old, after all. Vaush, along with these ""activists"" clearly have no understanding of art or art restoration and preservation processes with the way that he casually dismisses whatever inconvenience the stunt might cause.

The time I was most severely mentally ill was a couple of years ago at the height of my mental confusion, and femininity seemed like it would help me solve my then identity crisis. All it did, and also the reason mental illness I feel is so close to the progressive left is and was because femininity heavily forces social and appearance expectations on people that are incredibly unhealthy, especially on femboy internet groups, whose entire understanding of femininity comes from porn and manga

It encourages anxiety, low confidence, and making yourself weaker which are in any other context terrible, but when presented into a feminine person everyone seems to be fine with it for some reason, weird.

78,VaushV,"The Shoe drama was (or rather is) quite prominent on this sub. And with the recent Balenciaga stuff, it went insane.

I have watched Xanderhals, Demon Mamas, and now Vaushs response to the latest ""I won't apologize vid"" from shoe. And I think, all of them from their point of view are great videos on this. I didn't care much about Shoe before, and I probably won't care much for her after all of this, with the knowledge that I don't miss anything.

&amp;#x200B;

With all this now said, I just wanted to voice, that **I appreciate Vaushs take** on the video and all this recent Shoe drama. 

The part Im happy with is, that Vaush called out Shoe for her BS, and the terrible framing in her last video. I get the pressure Vaush gets from the left for being friends with Shoe and that he was hesitant with criticizing her, but overall I think his take addressed the issue with Shoe perfectly, while also talking about the ""Shoe derangement syndrome"" going on in the left. 

I hope, that Vaushs response won't destroy their friendship, and I think Vaush and Shoe staying friends would be better for everyone. Shoe still having friends in the left at least gives the opportunity for her to reflect on the criticism, while having no more ties could lead to her drifting into farther right spaces.

&amp;#x200B;

I myself have some right wing friends, and I don't agree with them and call out their BS, but I'm still friends with them. **The best way to get someone out of far right extremism is to give them a friendly community that calls out their BS, so they realize in the future that they were wrong.** 

I heard something from a YouTuber (cant remember who), that said, **he doesn't debate people to pull them over in an instant. He does it to plant seeds, and those seeds will one day grow, but it takes time.** Sometimes it takes month, sometimes years.

Let me give a list of what I mean, these are stances I have heard from actual leftists:

\- Racism is only power + privilege (wrong by every serious definition and also used by black supremacists)

\- Abortion should be legal in all cases with no exceptions. (There should absolutely be exceptions, especially around the time when the fetus gains the ability to feel pain).

\- We should use peoples personal ""neoprounouns"". (No, we shouldn't grovel at the feet, narcissistic, delusional people).

\- We should defund the police/abolish the police. (Now to be clear, the far left has already lost the culture war on this issue, but those who remain should drop it).

\- We should call paedophiles MAPs. (We should not call paedophiles ""minor attracted persons"", it destigmatizes paedophilia).

\- There is an ongoing trans genocide (No there isn't).

\- We should support fat acceptance (There is nothing good about being fat at all, and no we are not talking slightly overweight, those who support it tend to mean for obese people).

\- It is totally okay to wear BDSM gear and other weird sexualized stuff Infront of children on purpose during pride (Very weird and no, I see no reason why it should be normalized to wear fetish gear infront of kids).

Those are just some examples, but they illustrate my point.

Do I unironically drop the ""shoe helped turn me left in 2015/2016"" shit first or with the apology/admitting to being wrong in replies I don't think most of you read? I think I'll start by admitting this is incredibly pathetic and I know it, this might be the most pathetic post on this sub in the last year at least. Making a fuckin reddit post about admitting to being dumb for defending ShoeOnHead for a couple of replies, real down bad hours over here. I know MOST online leftists are pretty anti-shoe, and I get it. I've read the criticisms for years, I know the central points very well. I found Shoe when I was 15, when political Youtube was just getting out of its Gamergate phase, yet still in its Big Red in every thumbnail, feminist cringe compilation phase. Definitely wasn't right leaning in any way, was maybe more center/center-left, but I just didn't know shit. I had ZERO knowledge of anything. The most political I was at the time was enjoying Rage Against the Machine and agreeing with their baseline beliefs. A friend and I were obsessed with cringe comps, but not even political ones, we were into any cringe comps. Emo cringe, furry cringe, etc. It's only natural you come across ""feminist cringe"" compilations that way. From there, we stumbled across youtubers like Shoeonhead, Chris Ray Gun, you know the ones. This is the way I got into politics. I literally only clicked on Shoe's vids because she looked like an older version of my girlfriend, which should serve as some subtext that explains enough. None of those other 2015-2016 political youtubers stuck for me at that age. Chris was just never that funny, I always hated Sargon, obviously thought shit like Ben Shapiro was lame, Armored Skeptic became obviously cringe to me after a few videos, when it was obvious Blaire White was dishonest, I stopped watching her immediately. You get the point. I was stupid and ignorant in a 15 year old way, and clearly I was always going to lean more left than anything. Shoe was the only one of these Youtubers that stuck around for me. When she openly supported Bernie Sanders in 2015, and I subsequently learned about Bernie and his policies, my world opened up, and from then on I gained more knowledge on various leftist theories etc, you get it. Obviously, that era of Shoe content is not worth defending, there's plenty of phenomenally bad takes in several videos that even at my peak of Shoe defending, by the time I was aware enough, I would not defend. However, by 2019, Shoe felt like she was turning for the better. Most of her peers had gone so far right, or stayed just plainly center and reactionary, Shoe was becoming more openly soc-dem. She always was left-ish, but she was growing MORE left. Like I said, I'm very aware of the main criticisms people have had of her even since her becoming more openly Soc-dem. Personally, I'm a bit more lenient than some, I don't really care about people being the perfect little leftist. I've always felt like she should delete those older videos, but I was never going to HOLD honestly anything against her. At one point the whole ""pattern of behavior"" argument felt moot, as most of the criticisms of shit felt like it was far enough in the past, part of a larger problem online left spaces have that feel antithetical to unity, and I'm willing to give a lot of people room for error.

Which is why the past half a year, she's really disappointed me, and this Balenciaga saga is a personal turning point in the worst way. I did not pay attention to anything about it, because I personally don't care about conspiracy shit. I saw people replying to the post with debunks, and that was enough for me to brush it off as typical Shoe conspiracy posting. Did I think it was lame of her to post, especially with the timing? Absolutely, but that's all I processed it as: lame. When she put out the video, she swayed me. All I can attribute this to, personally, is just an absolute lack of brain power. Just straight up not thinking about it at all. She appealed to that part of me that strongly dislikes leftists who get really elitist about who is actually left, leftists who throw the term ""grifter"" around as though anyone who doesn't adhere to their strict idea of how to be is actually a faker and doesn't really understand Marxist theory etc. I think its pretty reasonable to say the pictures in question are....suspect. I never bought into this pizza-gate-esque bullshit, obviously, but the way she edits that video, it makes it seem like some people are just straight up ignoring that, or outright defending its oddity. So, yeah, I knew people on this sub have a hate-boner for her, so I went out of my way to see just what kind of shit people were saying, and did a little Shoe defending. At this point, its unquestionable that she really has this pattern for spreading right wing ideas and getting uptight and defensive when people call her out for it, and this time is no different. I know most of you reading are thinking ""no shit."" I knew that she was kinda like that already, but this time I legitimately believed the idea that, what she was doing wasnt THAT bad. ""This is just certain leftist circles being overly critical,"" I thought. ""Yeah, there are right wing followers of hers that are taking her worst points and running with them, but she herself isn't being as dumb as they think she is."" Stupid. I've deleted those replies, but there's no excuse. This is genuinely the point where someone like me has to admit, she's gone too far to defend, this is really  REALLY bad. 

At the root of all of this, as much as people joke about Shoe Simps, the real bottom line is that I don't want her to be like this. I know she's capable of being better than this. She could easily not be this person. In her better moments, she's way smarter than to just openly parrot right wing sentiments and thinking and burn bridges over criticism. At least that's how I felt. I know a lot people feel like its a dumb, pathetic sentiment, I really just don't want her to be this person. Either way, this was just to say that you guys were right.

Emo cringe, furry cringe, etc. It's only natural you come across ""feminist cringe"" compilations that way. From there, we stumbled across youtubers like Shoeonhead, Chris Ray Gun, you know the ones. This is the way I got into politics. I literally only clicked on Shoe's vids because she looked like an older version of my girlfriend, which should serve as some subtext that explains enough. None of those other 2015-2016 political youtubers stuck for me at that age. Chris was just never that funny, I always hated Sargon, obviously thought shit like Ben Shapiro was lame, Armored Skeptic became obviously cringe to me after a few videos, when it was obvious Blaire White was dishonest, I stopped watching her immediately. You get the point. I was stupid and ignorant in a 15 year old way, and clearly I was always going to lean more left than anything. Shoe was the only one of these Youtubers that stuck around for me. When she openly supported Bernie Sanders in 2015, and I subsequently learned about Bernie and his policies, my world opened up, and from then on I gained more knowledge on various leftist theories etc, you get it. Obviously, that era of Shoe content is not worth defending, there's plenty of phenomenally bad takes in several videos that even at my peak of Shoe defending, by the time I was aware enough, I would not defend. However, by 2019, Shoe felt like she was turning for the better. Most of her peers had gone so far right, or stayed just plainly center and reactionary, Shoe was becoming more openly soc-dem. She always was left-ish, but she was growing MORE left. Like I said, I'm very aware of the main criticisms people have had of her even since her becoming more openly Soc-dem. Personally, I'm a bit more lenient than some, I don't really care about people being the perfect little leftist. I've always felt like she should delete those older videos, but I was never going to HOLD honestly anything against her. At one point the whole ""pattern of behavior"" argument felt moot, as most of the criticisms of shit felt like it was far enough in the past, part of a larger problem online left spaces have that feel antithetical to unity, and I'm willing to give a lot of people room for error.

Which is why the past half a year, she's really disappointed me, and this Balenciaga saga is a personal turning point in the worst way. I did not pay attention to anything about it, because I personally don't care about conspiracy shit. I saw people replying to the post with debunks, and that was enough for me to brush it off as typical Shoe conspiracy posting. Did I think it was lame of her to post, especially with the timing? Absolutely, but that's all I processed it as: lame. When she put out the video, she swayed me. All I can attribute this to, personally, is just an absolute lack of brain power. Just straight up not thinking about it at all. She appealed to that part of me that strongly dislikes leftists who get really elitist about who is actually left, leftists who throw the term ""grifter"" around as though anyone who doesn't adhere to their strict idea of how to be is actually a faker and doesn't really understand Marxist theory etc. I think its pretty reasonable to say the pictures in question are....suspect. I never bought into this pizza-gate-esque bullshit, obviously, but the way she edits that video, it makes it seem like some people are just straight up ignoring that, or outright defending its oddity. So, yeah, I knew people on this sub have a hate-boner for her, so I went out of my way to see just what kind of shit people were saying, and did a little Shoe defending. At this point, its unquestionable that she really has this pattern for spreading right wing ideas and getting uptight and defensive when people call her out for it, and this time is no different. I know most of you reading are thinking ""no shit."" I knew that she was kinda like that already, but this time I legitimately believed the idea that, what she was doing wasnt THAT bad. ""This is just certain leftist circles being overly critical,"" I thought. ""Yeah, there are right wing followers of hers that are taking her worst points and running with them, but she herself isn't being as dumb as they think she is."" Stupid. I've deleted those replies, but there's no excuse. This is genuinely the point where someone like me has to admit, she's gone too far to defend, this is really  REALLY bad. 

At the root of all of this, as much as people joke about Shoe Simps, the real bottom line is that I don't want her to be like this. I know she's capable of being better than this. She could easily not be this person. In her better moments, she's way smarter than to just openly parrot right wing sentiments and thinking and burn bridges over criticism. At least that's how I felt. I know a lot people feel like its a dumb, pathetic sentiment, I really just don't want her to be this person. Either way, this was just to say that you guys were right. She is back in atrocious territory. I don't like it."

My family is heavily Christian and conservative, particularly the pentecostal speaking-in-tongues kind, so aside from a message from my brother and mom saying that they love me I got silence from them. Otherwise though, I got a heap of support from progressive/moderate Facebook friends and now feel comfortable enough to share pro-lgbt/trans posts on there. I'm still in shock, since I wasn't sure I would ever be able to come out to anyone. Since I'm a man and am engaged to a woman, I figured it would be less hassle to just stay straight-passing and not mention my bi-ness to anyone.

Watching Vaush debate conservatives and debunk religious talking heads like Shabibo and Matt Walsh helped me realize that they don't have any concrete facts or logic to their belief systems, and that their vision of America is one where LGBT people are discriminated against or even killed (one would just need to take a look at Russian anti-gay laws to see how this could play out). By coming out on Facebook my hope is that any friends or family from these past extreme churches will realize that LGBT people are everywhere and are real people. They could be anyone they know, even straight-passing individuals, and their hate/bigotry can have serious repercussions. I feel super pumped up to do some serious activism too :D

210,VaushV,,The end times.,1670796154,The end times. 
211,VaushV,"As someone who studied insurgent conflicts and guerrilla warfare in the 20th and 21st century, I doubt the US military can crush a Qanon/far right insurgency. The idea of the US military crushing a armed rebel  force, with no regard for civilian life, no regard for Geneva, no public backlash for the collateral damage and still having ""hearts and minds"", is further from reality than the conservative's idea of beating the US army with their  ar15s. Especially given the fact that every war the US military lost, involved fighting guerrilla forces.

I've seen a lot of lefties (including the ones here), or ""vaushites"" as they're called on this subreddit support the idea of the US government conducting ""war on domestic terror"" operation against  people who disagree with the left, or ""far right extremists"" as y'all  call them. Here's some reasons why this is the worst idea in the long,  sad history of bad ideas, that will backfire horribly on, not just the  US army but also the American left as well.

1. The  US military sucks at fighting against insurgents and get it's ass kicked every time in guerrilla conflicts. From Vietnam, to more recently Afghanistan, guerrilla warfare has proven to be the US military's kryptonite. In addition, the idea that it's impossible for a  group to wage guerrilla warfare against their own government, has proven to be incorrect by the Troubles conflict, the Gaza conflict, and the Mexican drug war-even the CJNG cartel can beat the US army should we invade Mexico. Given, that the US is fighting an insurgency within their own borders, the insurgents may not even have to meet them on the battlefield, they could pay them a vist at their home, with their wife and kids (a favorite tactic used by the Mexican Drug cartels) along with other advantages a domestic insurgency would have, like the [open US Mexican border we have](https://preview.redd.it/oh81wvbqyvr91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8949a59b622abf611dad8acaaf0efd18d6b43127).
2. The  US military has a terrible track record of killing more civilians, which as a result, turns the civilian population against them and boosts support for the insurgents, giving them a powerful  propaganda weapon. Anyone who knows a lot about the Afghan war or better yet served should know this fact, if not [perhaps I should refresh your memory](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/10/how-mass-killings-by-us-forces-after-911-boosted-support-for-the-taliban)?  All it would take is for a drone to ""mistakenly"" blow up a minivan with a family inside or a platoon of US soldiers to massacre some rural town in Texas, just like they did to villages in [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%E1%BB%B9_Lai_massacre) and [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_massacre), and then there will be [thousands of Americans joining the right wing militias groups](https://i.redd.it/wi783i6k2hw91.jpg).  [With stats like those](https://web.archive.org/web/20210819055441/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/world/asia/afghanistan-civilian-casualties-united-nations.html),  sending the US army after the ""gravy seals"" or ""meatball militia"" would be more of a  gift to the far right rather than a curse. As the American public will blame the civilian deaths, caused by the US military, on the US government 99% of the time. Drones have proven to be a powerful  recruitment tool for [insurgent/terrorist](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/how-drones-create-more-terrorists/278743/) groups, due to drones being prone to killing more civilians. Even if you deplatform every far rightist on the internet, assuming it works, **it won't matter, as the US security forces (including the US army) will be doing a very good job of radicalizing people into becoming far right guerrillas, by killing civilians-even if it's on accident-and making it go viral on the internet. Too bad for the left, the idea of how their own actions can radicalize people against them, is a foreign concept.**
3. There would likely be foreign intervention on behalf of the insurgents.  Not in the form of invading, but in the form of arming the militias with AT weapons and MANPADS. It's funny how you guys think the whole world be in opposition  to some ""far right"" guerrillas in the US-just how they were against the  Taliban, Hamas, and the Islamic army of Iraqi. US government has a lot  of foreign enemies, few of them being very powerful. You'd be an idiot to think said foreign government won't intervene in a domestic armed conflict within the US. Chances are they will be foreign military support for the ""gravy seals"", for the foreign government's own benefit or  interests. Further, arming a far right militia in the US, could benefit a country's agenda, I.E annexing Taiwan or retaliating for intervention in the Ukraine war. At worst WW3 could start on US soil, however it's unlikely, since the US government is more afraid of WW3, than it is of far right militias running around, on their soil, with RPG7s and QW-4s. A foreign country arming an domestic militant group, within your country, isn't worth declaring war over. Otherwise the UK should've gone to war with Libya, over arming the IRA. **In a way it will be like ""Red Dawn"", except, the Russians are the good guys and the Wolverines fight the US government with Russian help.** Given recent events, if I were Russia or China, arming some American far right militia with RPGs, LMGs, and Iglas/QW-4s, Operation Cyclone style, would be a fitting act of retaliation for sanctions, Ukraine, or Taiwan. I could argue it's a win-win for everyone: rednecks get some fancy firepower, [Russia](https://preview.redd.it/5iil82sqyvr91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c5a42724e4ce130aeeb4d7b67624ef30678e66e) and China would have a proxy army within US soil, and the air force would enjoy the thrills of evading SAMs within American airspace (and their families can watch on the ground too). Worst case scenario for the US government, is that a foreign government, like North Korea, is crazy enough to arm the ""American Taliban"" with a few, small, portable nuclear weapons, putting the government in a ultimatum-choosing between appeasement or nuclear annihilation.
4. The US military and it's allies have a lot of pressure and expectation to follow Geneva conventions and avoid civilian casualties at any cost. Meaning they can't use nukes against the militias and they can't kill civilians even if they're pro-MAGA. It's nothing new, the US couldn't even touch Afghan civilians who supported the Taliban. Which puts the insurgents at an advantage, while the US army has too much pressure to follow the rules in order to keep hearts and minds. I mean when the US army commits a mass killing of civilians, they get 2 to 4 times the backlash from the public, than if the insurgent/terrorist group does the same thing. Of course Geneva won't stop the US army from committing warcrimes, but it does set the conditions for the entire world to turn on the US, should they go use an iron fist against the MAGA militia. Therefore, due to Geneva, Public opinion, and the previously mention radicalization, the US military would be forced to fight a domestic insurgency with kid gloves, while ""y'all Qaeda"" has the liberty to use every illegal weapon or tactic-from human shields to WMDs-against the US army and get little to no backlash from it.
5. The  left has a severe case of the Dunning Kruger effect when it comes to counter insurgency: they heavily underestimate the militias based on assumptions and at best anecdotal evidence, while also being overconfident in the US army's counter insurgency. Even the leftist veterans/servicemembers have a flawed understanding of insurgent warfare, viewing guerrillas conflicts in the sense of conventional warfare, indicating that the US hasn't learned from Afghanistan. Further, leaving Afghanistan may have denied the zoomer US soldiers an opportunity to gain experience with fighting guerrillas, which would only make them more prone to killing civilians and getting killed by insurgents-which is a good thing for the militias. A wise former Kosovo Liberation Army member once said ""conventional armies usually don't understand guerrilla warfare"". They also expect a different result to come out of the US military, doing the same thing it did in Afghanistan  and Iraq, only this time, on US soil-the **literal definition of insanity**.  Plus, in the **short history of leftist counterinsurgency, it has almost always failed:** Soviets lost to goat herders, Sandinistas lost to the Contras,  only mitigating their defeat, and lastly the War in Afghanistan.
6. Since  this counterinsurgency would be waged by a Democrat administration and assuming the country remains a democracy, I  won't be surprised that the dems lose a lot of elections, voted out by people ***who really dislike getting ""accidentally"" killed by their own military***\-I know **shocker**. Even if that means voting for the GOP back in office. If you think otherwise then answer these questions. How many months, years, possibly decades of roadside bombs, getting caught in firefights between the military and the insurgents, and lock downs (more severe than the covid kind) with armed checkpoints as part of the daily commute, is tolerable for the left, let alone the American public? How many US soldiers killed by insurgents and civilians killed by the US security forces will take before, negotiating peace with the far right insurgents, is the preferable or only way to end the insurgency?

Bottom line  is the US military sucks at fighting against guerrillas. So much so, that even the ""rednecks"" or whatever you want to call them can beat the US army, using guerrilla warfare tactics-even the [Taliban themselves agree](https://i.redd.it/1qqiifsu5nx91.jpg). Which is also why the British army failed to defeat the IRA, they even admitted that officially, and as well as why Hamas is still fighting strong despite the  IDF's bombardments.

Not to mention  that any crackdown on dissent, any civilian casualties caused by the US  military, and revocation of civil liberties, will turn domestic and international opinion against the US government.

And it's not just me saying this: other people, one of which has studied  insurgencies, have held a similar opinions about the idea of using the  US army to fight ""far right terrorism"".

&gt;\*If  the United States were to use similarly militarized tactics at home,   even if toned down compared with the heavy firepower mobilized abroad,   it could turn an already bad situation into an outright catastrophe.   Treating the situation in America as an insurgency carries grave risks.   It encourages the kind of security-centric approach that erodes civil   rights and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.\*A   sudden lurch from ignoring or underplaying the threat of right-wing   extremism to treating White crusaders like Islamist militants and QAnon   like al-Qaeda will set off the time bomb rather than defuse it.Launching   a counterinsurgency campaign in the war-on-terror mold against   right-wing extremists will not defeat the tiny and disparate bands of   armed groups across the country. Instead, if the U.S. experience in the   rest of the world is any guide, it will transform these zeros into   heroes. It will embolden them and strengthen their resolve. And it will   enable them to excel in their favorite role, that of persecuted martyr.

&gt;Sixty  years of U.S. experience has taught the same lesson about  counterinsurgency: If you lose, you lose. If you win, you still lose.Every  time the Marines demolished another outpost of domestic  resistance, it  would only exacerbate the underlying crises. ‚ÄúYou will  occasionally  hear people say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not worried about an insurrection  because the  Army‚Äôs got all the tanks and the Air Force has bombers,‚Äô‚Äù  Bolger said.  ‚ÄúLook, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre reduced to, just going in and  killing  people, you‚Äôre not solving the insurrection. In fact, you‚Äôre  spreading  it. You‚Äôre guaranteeing more of it.‚Äù You cannot punish people  out of  hating you. The military is an instrument of punishment. Its very   function makes it useless.To  ordinary people, to Americans trying to live their lives caught  between  the random violence of terrorists and the grinding repression of  the  state, victory and defeat would look much the same. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in a   situation where you‚Äôre using armed force to try to quell a population,   you‚Äôre either going to have to kill a bunch of them or you‚Äôre going to   pull out and let them have local control,‚Äù Bolger said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never   going to talk them into seeing it your way.‚Äù The United States, as an   entity, survived one civil war. The question for the next civil war is   not necessarily would the United States survive but would it be   recognizable after?

Source: [Why the US military isn't ready for civil war](https://thediplomaticworld.com/why-the-u-s-military-isnt-ready-for-civil-war/)

The only things a domestic counter insurgency would accomplish is:

* Kill a lot of innocent, unarmed civilians-something that **the US army is much better at doing.**
* **Create more insurgents/terrorists as a result of the civilian casualties.** Just like how it created more Taliban fighters.
* Lose  ""hearts and minds"" to the right wing militias, radicalizing the American public to support the insurgents and oppose the state, their own military and the left-cause they would be the party responsible for  the civilian casualties and war crimes caused by the US military. The left would become the Oathkeeper's #1 recruiter.
* Turn the whole world against the US government, in addition to the American  people, due to the many likely war crimes the US army has committed against its own people.
* **Getting the US army into another unwinnable war**, only this time it's within their own country.
* Get many of US soldiers killed, by their own citizens, let alone in vain.
* Possibly give the GOP a election winning streak-since they would be the anti war crowd, while the left would be the warmongers and aggressors, responsible for most of the civilian casualties in the 2nd civil war or American troubles.
* And ultimately fail to defeat the militias or far right insurgents, just like how the US failed to defeat the Taliban, Islamic army, and the  Vietcong, as well as the UK failing to beat the IRA and the Mexican gov is currently failing to beat the CJNG.

If what you call ""democracy"", dies. It's most likely gonna die from denying political dissent/opposition, all and every peaceful method for expression and advocacy, leaving them no choice but violence. Thus creating a huge incentive for it, as the best and only form of expression-propaganda by deed. This is partly how the Troubles, the Iraqi, and Taliban insurgencies started. It's like the famous saying ""violence is the voice of the unheard"", a saying you guys used to justify the riots back during the Trump era.

Further, the idealistic belief if you deny a group, an ""intolerant"" group, all the political power and completely deplatform or censor them is just as much based on fantasy. I mean insurgent/terrorist campaigns, like the Taliban insurgency and the Troubles, are direct consequence of denying their group any and all of the political power and platforms. Something that Vaush hopes happens to conservatives/republicans. Most people to tend consider insurgent campaigns justified, when the group in question has exhausted or denied every peaceful and democratic method, by their opposition, just ask any Islamic fundamentalist or Irish republican if the insurgent campaigns were justified and why. The ""paradox of tolerance"" has been rendered obsolete by guerrilla warfare's popularity among the ""intolerant"". Besides, leftists suck at counterinsurgeny, they lost to the mujahideen twice-first in '89 and second in 2021-and brought to their knees by the Nicaraguan contras. Left wing governments aren't as familiar and experienced when dealing with guerillas/insurgents, but when they do, they lose to them 95% of the time-mostly due to the killings of civilians they (intentionally or accidentally) cause.

Now  the left, including you guys, doesn't have to listen my advice, especially given the left is blinded by their arrogance and  overconfidence. I'm just saying, **not wise to threaten ar-toting rednecks with a military that lost to ak-toting goat herders**. I don't expect  the left to be wise enough to listen any advice even if it's good, choosing to use an insane method that will backfire, just to own the cons.",Why the US military would most likely lose to a far right insurgency,1670795342,"Why the US military would most likely lose to a far right insurgency As someone who studied insurgent conflicts and guerrilla warfare in the 20th and 21st century, I doubt the US military can crush a Qanon/far right insurgency. The idea of the US military crushing a armed rebel  force, with no regard for civilian life, no regard for Geneva, no public backlash for the collateral damage and still having ""hearts and minds"", is further from reality than the conservative's idea of beating the US army with their  ar15s. Especially given the fact that every war the US military lost, involved fighting guerrilla forces.

I've seen a lot of lefties (including the ones here), or ""vaushites"" as they're called on this subreddit support the idea of the US government conducting ""war on domestic terror"" operation against  people who disagree with the left, or ""far right extremists"" as y'all  call them. Here's some reasons why this is the worst idea in the long,  sad history of bad ideas, that will backfire horribly on, not just the  US army but also the American left as well.

1. The  US military sucks at fighting against insurgents and get it's ass kicked every time in guerrilla conflicts. From Vietnam, to more recently Afghanistan, guerrilla warfare has proven to be the US military's kryptonite. In addition, the idea that it's impossible for a  group to wage guerrilla warfare against their own government, has proven to be incorrect by the Troubles conflict, the Gaza conflict, and the Mexican drug war-even the CJNG cartel can beat the US army should we invade Mexico. Given, that the US is fighting an insurgency within their own borders, the insurgents may not even have to meet them on the battlefield, they could pay them a vist at their home, with their wife and kids (a favorite tactic used by the Mexican Drug cartels) along with other advantages a domestic insurgency would have, like the [open US Mexican border we have](https://preview.redd.it/oh81wvbqyvr91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8949a59b622abf611dad8acaaf0efd18d6b43127).
2. The  US military has a terrible track record of killing more civilians, which as a result, turns the civilian population against them and boosts support for the insurgents, giving them a powerful  propaganda weapon. Anyone who knows a lot about the Afghan war or better yet served should know this fact, if not [perhaps I should refresh your memory](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/10/how-mass-killings-by-us-forces-after-911-boosted-support-for-the-taliban)?  All it would take is for a drone to ""mistakenly"" blow up a minivan with a family inside or a platoon of US soldiers to massacre some rural town in Texas, just like they did to villages in [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%E1%BB%B9_Lai_massacre) and [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_massacre), and then there will be [thousands of Americans joining the right wing militias groups](https://i.redd.it/wi783i6k2hw91.jpg).  [With stats like those](https://web.archive.org/web/20210819055441/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/world/asia/afghanistan-civilian-casualties-united-nations.html),  sending the US army after the ""gravy seals"" or ""meatball militia"" would be more of a  gift to the far right rather than a curse. As the American public will blame the civilian deaths, caused by the US military, on the US government 99% of the time. Drones have proven to be a powerful  recruitment tool for [insurgent/terrorist](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/how-drones-create-more-terrorists/278743/) groups, due to drones being prone to killing more civilians. Even if you deplatform every far rightist on the internet, assuming it works, **it won't matter, as the US security forces (including the US army) will be doing a very good job of radicalizing people into becoming far right guerrillas, by killing civilians-even if it's on accident-and making it go viral on the internet. Too bad for the left, the idea of how their own actions can radicalize people against them, is a foreign concept.**
3. There would likely be foreign intervention on behalf of the insurgents.  Not in the form of invading, but in the form of arming the militias with AT weapons and MANPADS. It's funny how you guys think the whole world be in opposition  to some ""far right"" guerrillas in the US-just how they were against the  Taliban, Hamas, and the Islamic army of Iraqi. US government has a lot  of foreign enemies, few of them being very powerful. You'd be an idiot to think said foreign government won't intervene in a domestic armed conflict within the US. Chances are they will be foreign military support for the ""gravy seals"", for the foreign government's own benefit or  interests. Further, arming a far right militia in the US, could benefit a country's agenda, I.E annexing Taiwan or retaliating for intervention in the Ukraine war. At worst WW3 could start on US soil, however it's unlikely, since the US government is more afraid of WW3, than it is of far right militias running around, on their soil, with RPG7s and QW-4s. A foreign country arming an domestic militant group, within your country, isn't worth declaring war over. Otherwise the UK should've gone to war with Libya, over arming the IRA. **In a way it will be like ""Red Dawn"", except, the Russians are the good guys and the Wolverines fight the US government with Russian help.** Given recent events, if I were Russia or China, arming some American far right militia with RPGs, LMGs, and Iglas/QW-4s, Operation Cyclone style, would be a fitting act of retaliation for sanctions, Ukraine, or Taiwan. I could argue it's a win-win for everyone: rednecks get some fancy firepower, [Russia](https://preview.redd.it/5iil82sqyvr91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c5a42724e4ce130aeeb4d7b67624ef30678e66e) and China would have a proxy army within US soil, and the air force would enjoy the thrills of evading SAMs within American airspace (and their families can watch on the ground too). Worst case scenario for the US government, is that a foreign government, like North Korea, is crazy enough to arm the ""American Taliban"" with a few, small, portable nuclear weapons, putting the government in a ultimatum-choosing between appeasement or nuclear annihilation.
4. The US military and it's allies have a lot of pressure and expectation to follow Geneva conventions and avoid civilian casualties at any cost. Meaning they can't use nukes against the militias and they can't kill civilians even if they're pro-MAGA. It's nothing new, the US couldn't even touch Afghan civilians who supported the Taliban. Which puts the insurgents at an advantage, while the US army has too much pressure to follow the rules in order to keep hearts and minds. I mean when the US army commits a mass killing of civilians, they get 2 to 4 times the backlash from the public, than if the insurgent/terrorist group does the same thing. Of course Geneva won't stop the US army from committing warcrimes, but it does set the conditions for the entire world to turn on the US, should they go use an iron fist against the MAGA militia. Therefore, due to Geneva, Public opinion, and the previously mention radicalization, the US military would be forced to fight a domestic insurgency with kid gloves, while ""y'all Qaeda"" has the liberty to use every illegal weapon or tactic-from human shields to WMDs-against the US army and get little to no backlash from it.
5. The  left has a severe case of the Dunning Kruger effect when it comes to counter insurgency: they heavily underestimate the militias based on assumptions and at best anecdotal evidence, while also being overconfident in the US army's counter insurgency. Even the leftist veterans/servicemembers have a flawed understanding of insurgent warfare, viewing guerrillas conflicts in the sense of conventional warfare, indicating that the US hasn't learned from Afghanistan. Further, leaving Afghanistan may have denied the zoomer US soldiers an opportunity to gain experience with fighting guerrillas, which would only make them more prone to killing civilians and getting killed by insurgents-which is a good thing for the militias. A wise former Kosovo Liberation Army member once said ""conventional armies usually don't understand guerrilla warfare"". They also expect a different result to come out of the US military, doing the same thing it did in Afghanistan  and Iraq, only this time, on US soil-the **literal definition of insanity**.  Plus, in the **short history of leftist counterinsurgency, it has almost always failed:** Soviets lost to goat herders, Sandinistas lost to the Contras,  only mitigating their defeat, and lastly the War in Afghanistan.
6. Since  this counterinsurgency would be waged by a Democrat administration and assuming the country remains a democracy, I  won't be surprised that the dems lose a lot of elections, voted out by people ***who really dislike getting ""accidentally"" killed by their own military***\-I know **shocker**. Even if that means voting for the GOP back in office. If you think otherwise then answer these questions. How many months, years, possibly decades of roadside bombs, getting caught in firefights between the military and the insurgents, and lock downs (more severe than the covid kind) with armed checkpoints as part of the daily commute, is tolerable for the left, let alone the American public? How many US soldiers killed by insurgents and civilians killed by the US security forces will take before, negotiating peace with the far right insurgents, is the preferable or only way to end the insurgency?

Bottom line  is the US military sucks at fighting against guerrillas. So much so, that even the ""rednecks"" or whatever you want to call them can beat the US army, using guerrilla warfare tactics-even the [Taliban themselves agree](https://i.redd.it/1qqiifsu5nx91.jpg). Which is also why the British army failed to defeat the IRA, they even admitted that officially, and as well as why Hamas is still fighting strong despite the  IDF's bombardments.

Not to mention  that any crackdown on dissent, any civilian casualties caused by the US  military, and revocation of civil liberties, will turn domestic and international opinion against the US government.

And it's not just me saying this: other people, one of which has studied  insurgencies, have held a similar opinions about the idea of using the  US army to fight ""far right terrorism"".

&gt;\*If  the United States were to use similarly militarized tactics at home,   even if toned down compared with the heavy firepower mobilized abroad,   it could turn an already bad situation into an outright catastrophe.   Treating the situation in America as an insurgency carries grave risks.   It encourages the kind of security-centric approach that erodes civil   rights and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.\*A   sudden lurch from ignoring or underplaying the threat of right-wing   extremism to treating White crusaders like Islamist militants and QAnon   like al-Qaeda will set off the time bomb rather than defuse it.Launching   a counterinsurgency campaign in the war-on-terror mold against   right-wing extremists will not defeat the tiny and disparate bands of   armed groups across the country. Instead, if the U.S. experience in the   rest of the world is any guide, it will transform these zeros into   heroes. It will embolden them and strengthen their resolve. And it will   enable them to excel in their favorite role, that of persecuted martyr.

&gt;Sixty  years of U.S. experience has taught the same lesson about  counterinsurgency: If you lose, you lose. If you win, you still lose.Every  time the Marines demolished another outpost of domestic  resistance, it  would only exacerbate the underlying crises. ‚ÄúYou will  occasionally  hear people say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not worried about an insurrection  because the  Army‚Äôs got all the tanks and the Air Force has bombers,‚Äô‚Äù  Bolger said.  ‚ÄúLook, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre reduced to, just going in and  killing  people, you‚Äôre not solving the insurrection. In fact, you‚Äôre  spreading  it. You‚Äôre guaranteeing more of it.‚Äù You cannot punish people  out of  hating you. The military is an instrument of punishment. Its very   function makes it useless.To  ordinary people, to Americans trying to live their lives caught  between  the random violence of terrorists and the grinding repression of  the  state, victory and defeat would look much the same. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in a   situation where you‚Äôre using armed force to try to quell a population,   you‚Äôre either going to have to kill a bunch of them or you‚Äôre going to   pull out and let them have local control,‚Äù Bolger said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never   going to talk them into seeing it your way.‚Äù The United States, as an   entity, survived one civil war. The question for the next civil war is   not necessarily would the United States survive but would it be   recognizable after?

The only things a domestic counter insurgency would accomplish is:

* Kill a lot of innocent, unarmed civilians-something that **the US army is much better at doing.**
* **Create more insurgents/terrorists as a result of the civilian casualties.** Just like how it created more Taliban fighters.
* Lose  ""hearts and minds"" to the right wing militias, radicalizing the American public to support the insurgents and oppose the state, their own military and the left-cause they would be the party responsible for  the civilian casualties and war crimes caused by the US military. The left would become the Oathkeeper's #1 recruiter.
* Turn the whole world against the US government, in addition to the American  people, due to the many likely war crimes the US army has committed against its own people.
* **Getting the US army into another unwinnable war**, only this time it's within their own country.
* Get many of US soldiers killed, by their own citizens, let alone in vain.
* Possibly give the GOP a election winning streak-since they would be the anti war crowd, while the left would be the warmongers and aggressors, responsible for most of the civilian casualties in the 2nd civil war or American troubles.
* And ultimately fail to defeat the militias or far right insurgents, just like how the US failed to defeat the Taliban, Islamic army, and the  Vietcong, as well as the UK failing to beat the IRA and the Mexican gov is currently failing to beat the CJNG.

If what you call ""democracy"", dies. It's most likely gonna die from denying political dissent/opposition, all and every peaceful method for expression and advocacy, leaving them no choice but violence. Thus creating a huge incentive for it, as the best and only form of expression-propaganda by deed. This is partly how the Troubles, the Iraqi, and Taliban insurgencies started.

""No"" you may think ""Comparing dog breeds to race is the racist position"" and you are completely right. **Comparing other races to dogs is racist.** 

That said, for some, you still stink of Nazi and they might not be as wrong as you think.  


When it comes to online debate there are certain strategies that Nazis have developed and we on the left have grown very adept at countering these strategies. I would love to just say [""Watch Alt-Right playbook""](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJA_jUddXvY7v0VkYRbANnTnzkA_HMFtQ) but lets list this out in a quick and loose style for everyone:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A) They often use sources that are either completely fraudulent or is against their viewpoints in its entirety but offers criticism to those they view as enemies.    
&gt;  
&gt;***^((Nazis will Cite sources critical of Liberals, ""The onlne Left"", or Israel).)***   
&gt;  
&gt;B) They trust people with clear and stated biases as uncompromising sources and yet will ignore legitimate sources by claiming bias or conspiracy. Often times they will say that those sources are on the opposite extreme of them, projecting their dishonesty onto you.  
&gt;  
&gt;***^((""Mainstream"" news isn't to be trusted. That paper was written by a communist. Joe Biden is a communist... etc.))***  
&gt;  
&gt;C) Every issue they argue about is urgent with great human / sociable cost and must be handled as soon as possible and whatever rights or death comes from their solution is ok because its the lesser of the two evils.   
&gt;  
&gt;***^((The end of Western Civilization because you fucked an aboriginal chick))***  
&gt;  
&gt;D) Once you are convinced of the above, they begin to re-write history with no sources needed.  
&gt;  
&gt;E) They lead you to somewhere to be radicalized... the ultimate end-goal.

If someone does A-C you know for a fact they are peddling misinfo and you can guess they are a Nazi depending on the type of misinfo they are peddling and, if they are, it often will lead to D and E. This is r/VaushV so you all should be familiar enough with Neo-Nazis to understand this... except... anti-Pit Bull users who behave in the exact same way are rewarded with Karma.   


Let me start with the Facts around Pit Bulls:  


We don't know how much Pit Bulls are in America. The best data we have says its 20 million [but this is unscientific af](http://web.archive.org/web/20190731184541/https://www.aspcapro.org/blog/2014/05/15/filling-pit). The larger fact is that we really don't know shit about dog breeds statistics. There are no serious standards for recording dog breed ownership and, until we include breeds of pets in the census, we are unlikely to know. I mean... even if we do... 

Pit Bulls are often [misidentified](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub). In fact let me take a direct quote from that source:

&gt;"" A study of all dog bite-related fatalities that occurred during the  10-year period 2000‚Äì2009 reported that 90% of the dogs involved were  described in at least one media account with a single breed descriptor,  potentially implying that the dog was purebred ([Patronek et¬†al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0095)). However, approximately 46% of the dogs in the US are mixed breed dogs ([American Veterinary Medical Association, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0010)),  and it seemed unlikely to the authors that purebred dogs would be  disproportionately represented among the dogs involved in these  incidents. Further, in only 18% of the cases were the authors able to  make a valid determination that the dog involved was a member of a  distinct, recognized breed ([Patronek et¬†al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0095)).  Nevertheless, unverified reports of the dog breeds involved in serious  and fatal incidents have been used to develop opinions regarding  perceived danger levels of different breeds[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#fn0010) ([Voith et al, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0135), [Voith et al, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0140), [Patronek et al, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0095)).""

There is currently 0 scientific evidence that Pit Bulls [""Lock their jaws""](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/089279388787058452?journalCode=rfan20) when they bite nor bite in a way that is unique from other large dog breeds. [This is a ridiculous lie and a lot of people just take it as fact...](https://phs-spca.org/myth-of-lockjaw/)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, no one in a scientific setting who's career is built on honesty will say, with the data we have, that Pit Bulls are more dangerous than any other large breed nor will they advocate on Breed Specific Legislation professionally. **The science here is inconclusive.** No one actually cares about the real number of Pit Bull bites because of the fact that it benefits no one...

The Anti-Pits are happy with working in misinformation (more on that).   
Reasonable don't care that much and feel that its ok to say that we simply don't know.  


With the absence of empirical evidence those in the anti-Pit camp have taken to the Neo-Nazi style of arguing and spreading their view points. They will link to sites like [dogsbite.org](https://dogsbite.org) and other clearly biased and unscientific sources to argue and when you point out that they are wrong they will paint you as unreasonable. They will neglect to argue against you but argue, instead, against the idea of you with the famous line ""I'm just saying that comparing human races with dog breeds is racist""... whether or not you actually compared dog breeds to human races.  


I am not saying that everyone who is in favor of banning Pit Bulls is a Nazi. I am not even saying that the people pushing these recycled strategies are Nazis. My point is that the reason people feel like these anti-Pit individuals are Nazis is because they often times sound pretty similar... [Just read this article](https://blog.dogsbite.org/2022/03/humane-groups-leveling-fake-racism-to-force-pit-bull-agenda-on-insurance.html). This Article, by Lucy Muir, was made in response to a white paper supported by The Humane Society, [Bestfriends.org](https://Bestfriends.org), Human Rescue Alliance, American Dog Breeders Association, The Animal Legal Defense Fund, and The American Kennel Club. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my favorite quote from Lucy's article: 

&gt;*""Linder's study looks at scant evidence from a single, small-scale examination that she administered to reach very weak conclusions. Linder  claims that people believe pit bulls are more likely to be owned by  Black people. She then claims this ""might"" mean that pit bull bans and  home insurance policies excluding pit bulls could possibly also  disproportionately restrict Black people from housing. She says this  ""possible"" racial discrimination ""might"" be intentional, but she has no  evidence of any of these suppositions.""* 

This is one of the most anti-science and anti-sociology quotes I've ever read.  [This is what she is responding to btw](https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/32171-25-1-third-articlepdf). 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take this article and see how well it lines up with Neo-Nazi tactics:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***A) They use sources that are either completely fraudulent or that are against their viewpoints in its entirety but offers criticism to those they view as enemies.***    
Every legitimate paper or book they link is only concerned with criticizing. Most egregiously is a quote from Author Dr. Benedict Boisseron who's quoted IN THE BOOK THE CITED as saying ""Dogs were once perceived as dangerous due to rabies, but today the black man is the one responsible for making the big dog look 'un-kind'"" ([Afro-Dog, page 17-18](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285629816_Afro-Dog)). This book they used literally agrees with the assessment of they are attacking, unequivocally... something you often find with sources used by covert Neo-Nazis.  
&gt;  
&gt;***B) They trust people with clear and stated biases as uncompromising sources and yet will ignore legitimate sources by claiming bias or conspiracy.***   
They quite literally frame this paper backed by the largest legitimate animal rights group as a part of this ""Pit Bull Advocates"" (PBA's). A fake term that means... anyone who opposes them.   
&gt;  
&gt;***C) Every issue they argue about is urgent with great human / sociable cost and must be handled as soon as possible and whatever rights or death comes from their solution is ok because its the lesser of the two evils.***   
This article doesn't do this... because it doesn't have to. Right at the top of the page is this websites famously inaccurate Dog Bite Statistics and throughout the page are pictures of babies and children. They have to ban the pit bulls because if they don't they will kill these babies.   
&gt;  
&gt;***D) Once you are convinced of the above, they begin to re-write history with no sources needed.***  
In this article the writer speaks about ""The Authors"". These are not the Authors of the White Paper this article is criticizing but rather the authors who created a false history when people liked Bull Dogs before it got stigmatized.  
&gt;  
&gt;***E) They lead you to somewhere to be radicalized... the ultimate end-goal.***  
For this I'll just leave this comment underneath the article by Boni, ""The problem doesn‚Äôt belong to the culture/race of those conned into taking pitbulls home‚Ä¶ the problem belongs to the financial beneficiaries of promoting pitbulls as safe pets‚Äìendangering everyone. The photographic evidence is pretty clear on who they are.""

  
Let me conclude by saying that there are no larger, more focused, more well-funded, and more willingly deceptive group when it comes to online discourse than White Supremacists. Ultimately all misinfo spread by random individuals online may appear to be Nazi-like because of how much effort they have put into spreading misinformation... that being said... motherfuckers are JQing in these comments so obviously some of them are just Nazis.

Originally I was just going to tear into some anti-Pit Bull comments this morning but I saw so much comments that fit in with my recent watching of Alt-Right Playbook that I felt compelled to make this post. I am hoping to educate as much people in this sub as possible to the facts around Pit Bulls and the facts around the tactics used by the only side in this discourse. I've seen too many other-wise neutral people saying stuff like ""Anti-Pit Bull vs Pro-Pit Bull"" which is not the argument taking place... that would be like framing the debate as ""Kanye vs The Left"".","Doggos, Misinformation, and Online Discourse: Why are people in favor of banning Pit Bulls called racist?",1670789226,"Doggos, Misinformation, and Online Discourse: Why are people in favor of banning Pit Bulls called racist? Its been a while since I made a post about Pit Bulls and I think a lot of people here who are just worried about bad dog owners getting lethal dogs may be left confused with other people calling them Nazis or Racists. ""No"" you may think ""Comparing dog breeds to race is the racist position"" and you are completely right. **Comparing other races to dogs is racist.** 

That said, for some, you still stink of Nazi and they might not be as wrong as you think.  


When it comes to online debate there are certain strategies that Nazis have developed and we on the left have grown very adept at countering these strategies. I would love to just say [""Watch Alt-Right playbook""](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJA_jUddXvY7v0VkYRbANnTnzkA_HMFtQ) but lets list this out in a quick and loose style for everyone:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A) They often use sources that are either completely fraudulent or is against their viewpoints in its entirety but offers criticism to those they view as enemies.    
&gt;  
&gt;***^((Nazis will Cite sources critical of Liberals, ""The onlne Left"", or Israel).)***   
&gt;  
&gt;B) They trust people with clear and stated biases as uncompromising sources and yet will ignore legitimate sources by claiming bias or conspiracy. Often times they will say that those sources are on the opposite extreme of them, projecting their dishonesty onto you.  
&gt;  
&gt;***^((""Mainstream"" news isn't to be trusted. That paper was written by a communist. Joe Biden is a communist... etc.))***  
&gt;  
&gt;C) Every issue they argue about is urgent with great human / sociable cost and must be handled as soon as possible and whatever rights or death comes from their solution is ok because its the lesser of the two evils.   
&gt;  
&gt;***^((The end of Western Civilization because you fucked an aboriginal chick))***  
&gt;  
&gt;D) Once you are convinced of the above, they begin to re-write history with no sources needed.  
&gt;  
&gt;E) They lead you to somewhere to be radicalized... the ultimate end-goal.

If someone does A-C you know for a fact they are peddling misinfo and you can guess they are a Nazi depending on the type of misinfo they are peddling and, if they are, it often will lead to D and E. This is r/VaushV so you all should be familiar enough with Neo-Nazis to understand this... except... anti-Pit Bull users who behave in the exact same way are rewarded with Karma.   


Let me start with the Facts around Pit Bulls:  


We don't know how much Pit Bulls are in America. The best data we have says its 20 million [but this is unscientific af](http://web.archive.org/web/20190731184541/https://www.aspcapro.org/blog/2014/05/15/filling-pit). The larger fact is that we really don't know shit about dog breeds statistics. There are no serious standards for recording dog breed ownership and, until we include breeds of pets in the census, we are unlikely to know. I mean... even if we do... 

Pit Bulls are often [misidentified](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub). In fact let me take a direct quote from that source:

&gt;"" A study of all dog bite-related fatalities that occurred during the  10-year period 2000‚Äì2009 reported that 90% of the dogs involved were  described in at least one media account with a single breed descriptor,  potentially implying that the dog was purebred ([Patronek et¬†al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0095)). However, approximately 46% of the dogs in the US are mixed breed dogs ([American Veterinary Medical Association, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0010)),  and it seemed unlikely to the authors that purebred dogs would be  disproportionately represented among the dogs involved in these  incidents. Further, in only 18% of the cases were the authors able to  make a valid determination that the dog involved was a member of a  distinct, recognized breed ([Patronek et¬†al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0095)).  Nevertheless, unverified reports of the dog breeds involved in serious  and fatal incidents have been used to develop opinions regarding  perceived danger levels of different breeds[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#fn0010) ([Voith et al, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0135), [Voith et al, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0140), [Patronek et al, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X?via%3Dihub#bib0095)).""

There is currently 0 scientific evidence that Pit Bulls [""Lock their jaws""](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/089279388787058452?journalCode=rfan20) when they bite nor bite in a way that is unique from other large dog breeds. [This is a ridiculous lie and a lot of people just take it as fact...](https://phs-spca.org/myth-of-lockjaw/)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, no one in a scientific setting who's career is built on honesty will say, with the data we have, that Pit Bulls are more dangerous than any other large breed nor will they advocate on Breed Specific Legislation professionally. **The science here is inconclusive.** No one actually cares about the real number of Pit Bull bites because of the fact that it benefits no one...

The Anti-Pits are happy with working in misinformation (more on that).   
Reasonable don't care that much and feel that its ok to say that we simply don't know.  


With the absence of empirical evidence those in the anti-Pit camp have taken to the Neo-Nazi style of arguing and spreading their view points. They will link to sites like [dogsbite.org](https://dogsbite.org) and other clearly biased and unscientific sources to argue and when you point out that they are wrong they will paint you as unreasonable. They will neglect to argue against you but argue, instead, against the idea of you with the famous line ""I'm just saying that comparing human races with dog breeds is racist""... whether or not you actually compared dog breeds to human races.  


I am not saying that everyone who is in favor of banning Pit Bulls is a Nazi. I am not even saying that the people pushing these recycled strategies are Nazis. My point is that the reason people feel like these anti-Pit individuals are Nazis is because they often times sound pretty similar... [Just read this article](https://blog.dogsbite.org/2022/03/humane-groups-leveling-fake-racism-to-force-pit-bull-agenda-on-insurance.html). This Article, by Lucy Muir, was made in response to a white paper supported by The Humane Society, [Bestfriends.org](https://Bestfriends.org), Human Rescue Alliance, American Dog Breeders Association, The Animal Legal Defense Fund, and The American Kennel Club. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my favorite quote from Lucy's article: 

&gt;*""Linder's study looks at scant evidence from a single, small-scale examination that she administered to reach very weak conclusions. Linder  claims that people believe pit bulls are more likely to be owned by  Black people. She then claims this ""might"" mean that pit bull bans and  home insurance policies excluding pit bulls could possibly also  disproportionately restrict Black people from housing. She says this  ""possible"" racial discrimination ""might"" be intentional, but she has no  evidence of any of these suppositions.""* 

This is one of the most anti-science and anti-sociology quotes I've ever read.  [This is what she is responding to btw](https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/32171-25-1-third-articlepdf). 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take this article and see how well it lines up with Neo-Nazi tactics:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***A) They use sources that are either completely fraudulent or that are against their viewpoints in its entirety but offers criticism to those they view as enemies.***    
Every legitimate paper or book they link is only concerned with criticizing. Most egregiously is a quote from Author Dr. Benedict Boisseron who's quoted IN THE BOOK THE CITED as saying ""Dogs were once perceived as dangerous due to rabies, but today the black man is the one responsible for making the big dog look 'un-kind'"" ([Afro-Dog, page 17-18](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285629816_Afro-Dog)). This book they used literally agrees with the assessment of they are attacking, unequivocally... something you often find with sources used by covert Neo-Nazis.  
&gt;  
&gt;***B) They trust people with clear and stated biases as uncompromising sources and yet will ignore legitimate sources by claiming bias or conspiracy.***   
They quite literally frame this paper backed by the largest legitimate animal rights group as a part of this ""Pit Bull Advocates"" (PBA's). A fake term that means... anyone who opposes them.   
&gt;  
&gt;***C) Every issue they argue about is urgent with great human / sociable cost and must be handled as soon as possible and whatever rights or death comes from their solution is ok because its the lesser of the two evils.***   
This article doesn't do this... because it doesn't have to. Right at the top of the page is this websites famously inaccurate Dog Bite Statistics and throughout the page are pictures of babies and children. They have to ban the pit bulls because if they don't they will kill these babies.   
&gt;  
&gt;***D) Once you are convinced of the above, they begin to re-write history with no sources needed.***  
In this article the writer speaks about ""The Authors"". These are not the Authors of the White Paper this article is criticizing but rather the authors who created a false history when people liked Bull Dogs before it got stigmatized.  
&gt;  
&gt;***E) They lead you to somewhere to be radicalized... the ultimate end-goal.***  
For this I'll just leave this comment underneath the article by Boni, ""The problem doesn‚Äôt belong to the culture/race of those conned into taking pitbulls home‚Ä¶ the problem belongs to the financial beneficiaries of promoting pitbulls as safe pets‚Äìendangering everyone. The photographic evidence is pretty clear on who they are.""

  
Let me conclude by saying that there are no larger, more focused, more well-funded, and more willingly deceptive group when it comes to online discourse than White Supremacists. Ultimately all misinfo spread by random individuals online may appear to be Nazi-like because of how much effort they have put into spreading misinformation... that being said... motherfuckers are JQing in these comments so obviously some of them are just Nazis.

Originally I was just going to tear into some anti-Pit Bull comments this morning but I saw so much comments that fit in with my recent watching of Alt-Right Playbook that I felt compelled to make this post. I am hoping to educate as much people in this sub as possible to the facts around Pit Bulls and the facts around the tactics used by the only side in this discourse. I've seen too many other-wise neutral people saying stuff like ""Anti-Pit Bull vs Pro-Pit Bull"" which is not the argument taking place... that would be like framing the debate as ""Kanye vs The Left""."

It is crickets in regard to that point and laugh behavior with DGG chat, when a far-right individual is on stream or content is being played. Otherwise, progressives are cringe and it‚Äôs cool for DGGers to make fun of them constantly. That‚Äôs how it is. And these are paid subscribers as well, having the D logo next to their name.

Good evening, Sargon. It's great to be here with you today to discuss some important issues.

Sargon:
Yes, it's good to be here as well, Vaush. I'm looking forward to a lively debate.

Vaush:
So, Sargon, let's start with the topic of immigration. You have been very vocal in your opposition to allowing more immigrants into the country. Can you explain your position?

Sargon:
Certainly, Vaush. I believe that our country has reached a tipping point when it comes to immigration. We simply cannot continue to allow more and more people to come here without suffering the consequences.

Vaush:
But Sargon, don't you think that immigrants contribute to our society and economy? Many of them are hardworking and productive members of our communities.

Sargon:
I agree that some immigrants are hardworking and productive, but not all of them are. And even if they are, our country has limited resources and we need to prioritize the needs of our own citizens first.

Vaush:
But Sargon, aren't you forgetting that many immigrants are fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries? Don't they deserve a chance to live in safety and freedom?

Sargon:
I understand that some immigrants are fleeing dangerous situations, but we cannot simply open our borders and let everyone in. We need to carefully screen and vet each person to ensure that they are not a threat to our country.

Vaush:
But Sargon, don't you think that a policy of strict immigration controls is inhumane and unfair? We should not turn our backs on people who are in need.

Sargon:
I understand your point of view, Vaush, but I believe that we need to put the interests of our own citizens first. We cannot afford to take in everyone who wants to come here. We need to be responsible and protect our country.

359,VaushV,"Disclaimer: I'm not going to tell Vaush who to be friends with. That's weird ass parasocial behavior and that's his decision to make. Similarly, bashing her appearance and intelligence is also weird ass behavior and, in many ways, belittles the harm that she has done.

I only want to discuss the content of her video and ONLY the content in as good faith as I can.

Link to the video so you can hear her response directly: https://youtu.be/f0GeDNP_2mw

--

The recent hit-piece she made a day ago is frankly disgusting, and I want to break down the issues I have with it point by point:


Her implications that Xanderhal, The Serfs, Hunter Avallone, DemonMama, and other breadtube detractors are pedophile apologists/defenders by clip chimping them in her video. Many of them have already received death threats and mass reports nearly got Xan banned on Twitter. See their coverage/responses for more

She focuses the majority of her content creator attacks on DemonMama especially and pedojackets her. She censors the names of tweets of other content creators arguing against her besides DM because she's an easier target with a smaller audience.

While I will not defend people calling for violence against Shoe or insulting her intelligence/appearance, she is dismissing/handwaiving the best arguments/critiques made against her, notably:

&gt; Not dismissing to her audience that ""groomers"" don't mean LGBT people 12 hours after a mass shooting against a gay night club

&gt; Enabling violent rhetoric against LGBT people as a result of her tweet, which had made national news

&gt; Not engaging arguments against her tweet in good faith/blocking left wing critics because they ""didn't come to her in private""

Suggesting the left was the first people to connect this argument to ""gay groomers"" 

Taking a stance that all right wing extremists should not be deplatformed in the name of free speech, a dangerous position in terms of enabling stochastic violence. It is unclear is she doesn't believe stochastic violence exists or if she doesn't care, but free speech absolutism has clear and dangerous reprocussions. She has historically advocated for people like Alex Jones to be replatformed, who has provably done harm to people though stochastic rhetoric.

She's enables the right-wing argument the pedophilia is becoming normalized, which is outright false.

She claims she will block people being homophobic/transphobic in her comments, which is completely false. Regardless of what audience she wants to cultivate, she polices left wing arguments far more than right wing threats.

She cherrypicks the worst arguments made against her to paint her opposition as deranged. I'm not saying these arguments don't exist, but they are not the majority. Similarly, she does not scrutinize the extreme right wing interpretations of her tweet in her response

Her argument claiming that pedos are trying to infiltrate the LGBT community, a right wing conspiracy theory. She claims that the community is not accepting them, but this is especially dangerous rhetoric and that arguing against her poor rhetoric is only giving credence to this theory

Her normalizing that there will always be people on the right going after LGBT people as an acceptable standard. She is not an ally if she is complacent on this issue

She weaponizes her audience to harass people who disagree with her on the left, even against smaller accounts, which puts people in danger, especially small LGBT accounts

She dismisses the idea that her tweet is dogwhistling despite not qualifying her statement and in spite of many right wing comments confirming this interpretation. She then further states that people who don't think this is weird are gaslighting her and are suspect for it. Nobody is making the argument that these photos aren't weird and implies that anyone criticizing her rhetoric is a pedo apologist

&gt; I also want to include her weaponizing her audience against Hunter Avallone for his arguments on wanting to help non-offending pedos from getting help and never apologizing for her behavior against him. She is against people getting help/reformative justice and suggests any arguments to this point is pedo enabling behavior

Suggesting her detractors are getting paid by Balenciaga to suggest they are mouth pieces for the pedo enabling elite. This is not only dishonest but feeds into the idea that left leaning creators are grifters who approve of pedophilia if they can make a quick buck

Suggesting anyone criticizing her methodology for going after pedophilia is automatically calling her a nazi and showing no charitably towards nuance in how she's framing her arguments

She argues that the left will defend pedophilia because ""they are worried about giving the right ammo"". This is suggesting there is no good faith way to criticize the gay groomer argument while still being anti pedo

She refuses to change and promises that she will continue to engage in this behavior. She will not be moved off of these positions, even though the most charitable arguments, and her behavior will not change

The point of this post is not to tell Vaush how to handle his association with Shoe; again, that's weird ass parasocial behavior and I want no part in it. The point of making this post is to actually address the poor arguments she's making and to address the dishonesty she has towards level-headed, left wing criticisms and her lack of responsibility in qualifying her tweets/arguments. This sub has a bad history of not treating her problematic behavior in a constructive manner, and I hope this post can help correct that .

I also want to address the arguments that Shoe's suffering from brain rot or that she's not smart enough to know what she's doing. I truly believe she knows exactly what she's doing when she's dismissing these criticisms and weaponizing her audience, and that's the problem: her actions are not harmless nor made unintelligently. She doesn't go after her right wing audience for abusive behavior but whines the moment the left gives her a valid argument.

The larger problem with these arguments inpuning her intelligence is that it doesn't treat her behavior with the level of seriousness that it deserves to be treated with: she is a grown ass adult who is clearly successful on Twitter due to the smart decisions that she's made and she has to be treated with the same level of seriousness as any other political figure. Anything less is frankly sexist and enables her poor rhetoric.

On the other it‚Äôs hard living in a major city, like I do, and seeing people who are obviously are extremely mentally ill screaming and threatening random people on the street. Obviously this is bad not just for public safety, but also these people are also endangering themselves in the process. 

Since these people are obviously not going to be committing themselves it doesn‚Äôt seem like the only opinion is involuntarily commit them so that they can receive the treatment that they need."

Now I understand that non-violence in and of itself isn‚Äôt exactly look upon favorably here, and many in this subreddit have vocally advocated for armed defense and training for said armed defense, generally out of a belief that is either is the most effective method of defending oneself from danger, or the only way.

That being said, it seems the general opinion on this subreddit is that we shouldn‚Äôt bring guns, or MORE guns into our schools, regardless of the possibility of mass shooters.

What to do about this dilemma?

Here is why I want to talk about one Antoinette Tuff, who was able to stop a school shooting from happening by more or less, just talking to said shooter.

""The only problem with ‚ÄúFaith Under Fire‚Äù is what it doesn‚Äôt say. To begin, it didn‚Äôt quite bring out what Tuff actually said to Hill. 
In the 911 calls, she can be heard making use of an age-old script for exhorting people to pluck up their courage and desist from an unwise course. This script was so common ‚Äî and so effective ‚Äî that it was actually named and formalized in ancient times (the Romans called it a consolatio).""

Here i what she said in her 911 call:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kVpipSXRKA

""Another error of omission in the film stemmed from its depiction of what gave Tuff the strength to do what she did in the ordeal, which went on for hours.""

""The film set it down to faith in God""

""But Tuff herself has cited a kind of centering activity her pastor had taught her. In other words, it was more like a spiritual practice instead of, or along with, that faith.""

""The most important missing item, however, was an open acknowledgement of the things that failed to save the children: security gates, police, and a SWAT team.""

""A profound lesson seems to be lurking here ‚Äî namely that the human capacity for nonviolence is a more powerful way to achieve security than the institutions and paraphernalia we‚Äôre trying to rely on today.""

410,VaushV,"I really like TOS. As a libertarian, I think world should be essentially ran by the TOS. But there is a big missing aspect for this to actually work and correct me if I'm wrong, but I haven't seen this brought up whenever the issue of TOS pops up, like when Vaush got false striked recently, for example.

Let me start with the concept of ""an offer"". Where I live, it is a legally recognized term, so I assume it is the same in most western countries. Basically, if I kick someone out of my home for no reason, that is ok, because I have no obligation towards them to let them into my home. ""An offer"" is different. When you make an offer, you make an obligation - you basically agree in advance to a contract, and when a second person is willing to take up the offer, a contract is automatically made and binding. A product being displayed next to it's price is normally understood to be an offer.

You can, of course, make conditions on your offer - the TOS. However, if you didn't specify a condition, and someone takes you up on your offer, you can't just refuse, because you have already agreed to it in advance. For example, you have a bakery, and a gay couple wants you to make a wedding cake for them, but you don't want to. Do you have a public TOS that states that you don't provide services for gay couples? Then you can refuse, but everyone can see that you're a bigot and avoid your services accordingly. You don't? You're bound by the contract. 

So, what I'm getting at, as a company you can refuse service if, **and only if,** someone breaks the TOS. Conversely, if you terminate service without the TOS violation, then that's a breach of contract. I know, I know - this point didn't need such a long explanation, but I wanted to point out that it isn't just some obvious thing I believe, but that it can be shown to be a consequence of really basic legal principles.

And here is my actual point: as with any contract breach, such matters should be determined by the court. At the moment, when you get striked or banned, you can appeal to the service provider and that's it. That's like directing complaints about police brutality to the internal police investigation team.  And obviously it may seem ridiculous at a first glance... What court would look at a case of ""I got unfairly banned from Facebook?"" But then again we've made small claim courts for exacsttly this reason, because it wouldn't make sense to deal with such insignificant issues in a regular court.  We've made labour courts for a similar reason, to lower the finantial burden on the claimant. So why not this?

The way I imagine it, there should be a fully online legal court where you can dispute such issues, with only tiny fines issued: for the company if they cannot provide a reason for the ban or strike and for the claimant if the reason for the ban or strike is obviously valid.

Oh, and I will intercept one contrargument, because I know it will appear. Some companies tend to put stuff like ""we can terminate service for any or no reason"" into their TOS. Those clauses would not be seen as valid (the same way you can put many clauses on an employment contract that won't be recognized as valid by the court). Basically, you simply can't lie on a contract. You know how you can't advertise your product as ""will do X"", and then in small print clarify that ""this product does not actually do X""? It's the same thing. Being able to terminate service for no reason would make your offer not an offer. You can't make an offer and then write in small print ""this is not an offer"". Or at least you shouldn't be able to do that.

Oh, and I will intercept one contrargument, because I know it will appear. Some companies tend to put stuff like ""we can terminate service for any or no reason"" into their TOS. Those clauses would not be seen as valid (the same way you can put many clauses on an employment contract that won't be recognized as valid by the court). Basically, you simply can't lie on a contract. You know how you can't advertise your product as ""will do X"", and then in small print clarify that ""this product does not actually do X""? It's the same thing. Being able to terminate service for no reason would make your offer not an offer. You can't make an offer and then write in small print ""this is not an offer"". Or at least you shouldn't be able to do that.

https://twitter.com/anarchopac/status/1600547263423692817

Here‚Äôs the synopsis from AKPRESS:

""Means and Ends is a new overview of the revolutionary strategy of anarchism in Europe and the United States between 1868 and 1939. Zoe Baker clearly and accessibly explains the ideas that historical anarchists developed in order to change the world. 
This includes their views on direct action, revolution, organization, state socialism, reforms, and trade unions. Throughout, she demonstrates that the reasons anarchists gave for supporting or opposing particular strategies were grounded in a theoretical framework‚Äîa theory of practice‚Äîwhich maintained that, as people engage in activity, they simultaneously change the world and themselves. 
This theoretical framework was the foundation for the anarchist commitment to the unity of means and ends: the means that revolutionaries propose to achieve social change have to involve forms of activity which transform people into individuals who are capable of, and driven to, both overthrow capitalism and the state and build a free society. 
The consistent heart of anarchism was the idea that anarchist ends can only be achieved through anarchist means. Cutting through misconceptions and historical inaccuracies, Baker draws upon a vast assortment of examples to show how this simple premise underpinned anarchist attempts to put theory into action.""

Praise for Means and Ends:

""This informed attempt at systematizing the history of anarchism has the notable merit of focusing on practices, rather than distant utopias, and of probing into the overlooked sophistication of the theory that underpins those practices.""
‚ÄîDavide Turcato, editor of Malatesta‚Äôs Collected Works

""In Means and Ends: The Revolutionary Practice of Anarchism, Zoe Baker draws from well-known and lesser known anarchists to assemble a wide-ranging account of the strategies they have pursued to abolish capitalism and the state. Thoroughly researched, rich in detail, this book explores various ways in which anarchists have sought freedom within solidarity so that past experiences can inform present and future struggles.""

He says that he has a drag queen come in to perform for the kids, he says that the LGBTQ center at the school lets them play with butt plugs and dildos.  And look I‚Äôll admit, the way the video is cut, it seems weird.

As you would predict, the backlash to this has been massive with the school deleting its Twitter account, and legions of conservatives in an absolute frothing rage.  But here‚Äôs the thing, this is project Veritas.  I don‚Äôt trust them for a second.   I‚Äôm sure they did things to make this look way worse than it is.

They were not interested in intersex/NB people being used as part of an argument because they are statistical outliers. They also used persistent sexed differences in behaviors among both trans and cis people in social environments as a core example. (No sources, but I don‚Äôt think any are necessary to dismantle the argument.)

I would appreciate any thoughts on this as an example of an argument to bring to other people who may hold this problematic idea:

&gt;&gt;The binary is really not this important.

You opened this by writing off ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù and intersex folk, and by deferring to the data of the majority of babies being sexed as binary.

What if I told you that even this assumption is a falsehood. There is technically no reliable way to determine sex in any human being, if you take all factors into account.

Obviously, penis, vagina, XY chromosomes are the method we default to for this process, and for the most part, it has been a reliable form of categorization. But this categorization is itself a social construct. There has never been any hard, natural law enforced by physical limits that force us to draw this ‚Äúline‚Äù between the sexes. Before there was science, there was just people with different parts.

There is a consistent conversation in the world of Anthropology over how reliable current methods of sexing age-old skeletons are. Many skeletons from eons ago are collected as samples, and there are no reliable modern standards to determine the sex that these people may have been when alive. Many skeletons go unidentified, or first identified as M/F then later reverted.

Things like crime rates, sports performance, etc. are absolutely tied to the physical differences between the sexes as we currently categorize them, but the existence of these standards are socially constructed in the first place as well. This may sound like a cop out of sorts, but genuinely, these lines that we draw, in the grand scheme of themes, are very, very arbitrary. Furthermore, so are the socialization efforts and actions that we enforce and encourage that, over time, coalesce into changes in behavior that may have different impacts on broader society. Depending on what social patterns you observe across thousands of years and civilizations, you may be able to draw reasonable conclusions as to why men and women are ‚Äúseen as‚Äù this, or ‚Äúprone to do‚Äù that.

Back to governments, I‚Äôll close with this. Governments are a product of their time. There were many more governments and civilizations before ours, and there will be many more after. I encourage you to question just how permanent these standards are that you seem very quick to cling to. Is this out of comfort? Do you even trust these forms of categorization? Do you find them reasonable? Absolute?

If not, continue researching. Find out more about why people feel so strongly about this issue. Your understanding of this dilemma is only limited by your curiosity.

They stayed in power by consistency getting around 60-80% of the vote, something considered impossible for a party today. 

They also largely had the government until 1981 (though the golden era of the party was considered over), the international neoconservative political wave hit Norway in the 80‚Äôs (Reagan and Thatcher were the figureheads for this wave).

Fun little history lesson: The national union system, the welfare state as well as the oil fund was established by the (at the time very socialist) Labor party that had sole rule over the government in the post war period and until 1965 (their goal was to prepare the country for a transition to socialism). They stayed in power by consistency getting around 60-80% of the vote, something considered impossible for a party today. 

They also largely had the government until 1981 (though the golden era of the party was considered over), the international neoconservative political wave hit Norway in the 80‚Äôs (Reagan and Thatcher were the figureheads for this wave).

I was in the thread when this happened it was a a thread attached to one of tim pools comments, John burk started confronting some people in the thread, eventually the focus was on one particular left wing person. (i won‚Äôt name names unless asked, ill refer to him as Lefty) 

John replied to a few of his tweets and they got into the typical discourse you‚Äôd see between opposing political sides on twitter . One of johns fans popped in and started replying kind Stanning for John. This fan was gay  and in all likelihood right leaning judging by his bio and his tweets.

The left wing twitter user eventually attacked this  gay conservative, with ‚ÄúYou are a self hating gay man, voting for people that view you as subhuman and would want you stoned‚Äù

Instead he claims He claims ‚Äúsome leftist said I wanna stone gay people or something‚Äù 

Mysteriously his thread talking about the tweets and his suspension on twitter is removed along with the comments where he acknowledges his fans participation in the thread.

There are three main objections I have: Long Covid, China vs. the rest of the world, and Doomerism.

**Long Covid**

The biggest threat from Covid at this point is Long Covid, which consists of (a) long-term chronic illness and disability and (b) increased risk of other severe events (heart attack, stroke, diabetes, etc). You seem to at least partially be aware of this. You referenced it in your video, including how wide-spread it is.

And yet, several other assertions you make which downplay the severity are only valid in the context of concern about the acute phase of infection. For instance

1. The point of lockdowns is to keep numbers low enough that there are hospital beds available.

   This makes sense if your goal is to reduce death during the acute phase, but it doesn‚Äôt do much of anything to prevent Long Covid

2. Vaccines + boosters are very effective.

   Vaccines are very effective at preventing death during the acute phase. They provide only a little protection against Long Covid (~15-30%).

You repeat these points, saying that the precautions that countries need to be focused on are keeping hospital beds open and making vaccines available. What about masking, ventilation, air purifiers, and access to testing? There are many things we can be doing to reduce transmission not just the worst acute outcomes, and preventing infection is the only reliable way we have to prevent Long Covid.

**China vs. the rest of the world**[2]

You are extremely skeptical of all the data coming out of China, but you accept the numbers coming from the rest of the world relatively uncritically. I don‚Äôt think this makes sense.

We know numbers out of the U.S. are extremely suppressed. Nobody is testing anymore, and when they do they test with antigen tests (extremely high false negative rate) at home, and don‚Äôt report it. Since the original Omicron variant, the positivity rate has been up over 30% pretty consistently, and covid levels detected in wastewater have been elevated as well. The definition of being hospitalised from / dying from Covid has also changed, suppressing those metrics.

Is there good reason to be suspicious of anything China reports? Yes, absolutely. But when it comes to Covid cases (and deaths), there is also reason to believe them. When there are only a few cases in a region, they shut the whole region down. They publish every case on the news along with an extensive contact-tracing graph. How does that square with the idea that they‚Äôre under-reporting cases?

You say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why the numbers are what they are and I‚Äôm not going to attempt to answer that because it‚Äôs a little bit beyond me and I don‚Äôt want to spread misinformation‚Äù[1], but only after brainstorming several reasons, none of which were ‚ÄúChina has pretty good control over Covid, but occasionally there are outbreaks‚Äù. Is that not a reasonable explanation?

One other big thing that you (and much of the media) seem to miss is that most of China, most of the time, is not under lockdown. They impose lockdown, testing, etc, when and where there is an outbreak. This usually lasts a few months tops. Other than that, it‚Äôs almost entirely opened up.

**Doomerism**

‚ÄúIt seems like Covid-19, at least for right now, is here to stay. that‚Äôs not defeatism on my part, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ we have the cold, we have the flu, we have covid-19. is that bad? yes. is that still true? yes, also still true.‚Ä¶ Even if everyone is eventually guaranteed to get covid‚Ä¶‚Äù (12:15)[1]

Three things I notice:

1. If it‚Äôs not defeatism, what is it? You are resigned to everyone getting covid, hoping only that most won‚Äôt die during the acute phase. But you‚Äôre not proposing any resistance to Long Covid blanketing the population.

2. ‚Äúeven if everyone is guaranteed to get covid‚Ä¶‚Äù ignores the reality of reinfection. It‚Äôs not a binary of ‚Äúgot covid‚Äù or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get covid‚Äù but rather ‚Äúhow many times did you get covid‚Äù, each infection brings with it additional risk.

3. ‚Äúwe have the cold, we have the flu, we have Covid-19‚Äù Hmm‚Ä¶ I wonder where I‚Äôve heard that before.[3] Maybe you were being sarcastic here, but if so it‚Äôs hard to tell. The ‚ÄúCovid is like the flu‚Äù line has somehow become mainstream.

He lives on the war-torn outskirts of New Brussels (Previously Moscow), where he hides his beautiful blonde and almond eyed step-sister Elena from the clutches of the brutal New Atlantic army.

As musclebound NATO soldiers prowl the countryside searching for fertile russian girls, will stop at nothing to protect sweet Elena's purity. With his natural cute hair, flirty sissy skirt, harem face veil only showing his feminine eyes and fishnet stockings, Sasha gives his tender slavic body to a gang of pitiless NATO alpha soldiers: the ultimate act of courage and sacrifice.

While 2/3 years may not sound like a long time, the amount of progress is just unbelievable.

Models 2 years ago looked some more like this:

This masterpiece is important to the point about training data as back when models used to spit out images that look the picture above, it didn't really matter where you got your training data from. Add that research is fair use, a lot of times little thought was given to attribution. And forget about moderation, nobody is flogging their dolphin to this.

&amp;#x200B;

And then the DALL-E 2 demo dropped.

&amp;#x200B;

[\\"" A Shiba Inu dog wearing a beret and black turtleneck\\"" ](https://preview.redd.it/15gpq2q3084a1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19bb2139992627c63518fecbe112f8d7452ce3f2)

What made OpenAI's DALL-E 2 different was that it used a new method (latent diffusion) in the model itself (aka the brain). With this change, so did the dataset they used to train it.  In the official DALL-E 2 paper, they share that they used the original DALL-E dataset (250 Million Images) and another OpenAI project called CLIP ( generating text from images), to create a dataset totaling over 650 MILLON unique images. DALL-E 2 laid down the framework for how most current generators work, including Stable Diffusion (SD).   


Stable Diffusion was pitched to a growing userbase that was tired of the heavy limitations that DALL-E 2 had at the time (No real human faces, no violence, no political figures, can only be used on OpenAI's website, long waitlist, and strict rule enforcement that banned users) and how badly it performed in today's pop culture. It was presented as the soon-to-be open-source latent diffusion model that could run on any machine and didn't care what you type into that textbox. It was trained on a dataset called LAION 5B (side note: Stability AI, the company that made Stable Diffusion, funds LAION. LAION is a non-profit).  LAION 5B has over 2 BILLION uniquely labeled images scrapped from the internet. I recommend you look through it yourself.  If there is an artist you know that is even remotely popular, their art is in LAION 5B

[https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/](https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/)  


There was something different about SD when I first got a chance to use it during the alpha. It required a lot more prompting to the point the best users were just shoving a basic prompt and their own flavor list of  5 to 10 random artists. DALL-E 2 seems to have a dataset with far less copyrighted material as this method actually makes generations worse. During the SD early release, I saw with my own eyes the birth of the [Greg Rutkowski](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/) meta as alpha and beta users used it as a keyword that would apparently make generations better no matter what it was. Compared to DALL-E, it had practically no restrictions other than ""If you wouldn't say it to your mum, don't say it to SD"" (Quote from Emad, Owner of Stability AI).  Reminder at the time it was only available on a specific discord server where you can see what other people generated. Classic hits such as Lewd Celebrities, Big Booba Waifus, ""cute teens"", and one person I remember specifically trying to generate ""beautiful woman in diaper"" multiple times.   


I tried to bring up time and time again how open-sourcing the model would be a terrible move but the sentiment at the time was the tech was improving so fast that somebody was going to let the cat out of the bag. When Stability AI finally posted the model on Github, the impact on the space was just insane. The number of tools, new retrained community models (such as Waifiu Diffusion), and ease of access was at an all time new high. At what cost? Well, you should know by now.  


The good news is there is now a group of artists who have taken their fears and have organized to keep the community informed about what is going on in AI communities and the ACTUAL harm it is causing to artists. More importantly, they are highlighting the double standard in AI music generators compared to AI Images where it is common practice to completely avoid copyrighted works, even when the companies that make them are less than 5 people. Since Record Labels have a profit incentive in regard to their catalog, they do not care and have the money to sue you. They sued Youtube in its infancy and the platform has never been the same.  Artists don't have anywhere near this amount of power, and it's absolutely heartbreaking.  


I recommend following people like [Karla Ortiz](https://twitter.com/kortizart) on Twitter and other people who have kept artists informed about what is going on. While from my perspective Karla Ortiz sometimes get things wrong, they are far more often right and I applaud their efforts.  


  


Extra:  


I don't call what Midjourney, DALL-E2, or SD make ""Art"". These programs generate images, and the images are generations. It's what you do with it that makes it art. Calling what these programs generate in their raw form ""art"" is like calling a lump of iron a sword.  


Before these models even existed, I remember AI artists who actually trained their own models with their own money to make unique art.  Some of them to this day have not moved on and still use specialty StyleGAN (4-5 years old) models. These artists were mocked on most platforms because their AI Art wasn't ""Real Art"" and looked ugly. In less than a year, they are now lumped into a group of people who try to pass their generations as art or even blatantly train models based on an artist's style so they can replicate it. Most people still won't call this art, but it is to me.

I recommend following people like [Karla Ortiz](https://twitter.com/kortizart) on Twitter and other people who have kept artists informed about what is going on. While from my perspective Karla Ortiz sometimes get things wrong, they are far more often right and I applaud their efforts.  


  


Extra:  


I don't call what Midjourney, DALL-E2, or SD make ""Art"". These programs generate images, and the images are generations. It's what you do with it that makes it art. Calling what these programs generate in their raw form ""art"" is like calling a lump of iron a sword.  


Before these models even existed, I remember AI artists who actually trained their own models with their own money to make unique art.  Some of them to this day have not moved on and still use specialty StyleGAN (4-5 years old) models. These artists were mocked on most platforms because their AI Art wasn't ""Real Art"" and looked ugly. In less than a year, they are now lumped into a group of people who try to pass their generations as art or even blatantly train models based on an artist's style so they can replicate it. Most people still won't call this art, but it is to me.

""so what happened to the pRaGmAtIc idea that the most feasible path towards antifascist/antiimperial egalitarian reform is to push one of the TWO ENTRENCHED REACTIONARY BOURGEOIS PARTIES left by cultivating a pRoGrEsSiVe wInG in the party? wow yeah these progressive representatives and senators really showed who‚Äôs boss!!1!

""people want a wildcat strike‚ÄîWE HAVE NOT DONE THE WORK TO DESERVE TO CALL FOR THIS. what r u doing to build capacity and will to undertake and support a general strike in yr world?? u cant just sit back and expect some idealized mythical blue collar railman to do yr work for u.

‚ÄîEND QUOTE‚Äî

Democrats couldn‚Äôt have possibly fucked this package up worse. Obviously a rail strike would be economically devastating to the nation, so in that sense the governments whose job it is to look out for the best interests of society as a whole should step in. But they should of stepped in on the side of labor. If you‚Äôre going to stop the strike and strip labor of any leverage they once had, you have to grant them what they want/need. Otherwise we are no longer pretending to be anything other than an oligarchy. 

To intentionally break off the 7-day sick paid leave into a separate bill was insanity. This was no good faith attempt at brokering progress, this was intentional labor sabotage. 

Just really curious why no one here or Vaush really seem to care when as socialists labor is supposed to be ‚Äúour thing‚Äù.

""dont think many people‚Äîincluding lots of organizing professionals and their talking heads‚Äîare fully grasping the import of the rail strike bill. we have a ‚Äúpro-labor‚Äù democrat who has decided to copy RONALD FUCKEN REAGAN and quash workers for asking for a paltry handful of sick days (which, as people will remind u, were witheld from rail workers by BARACK FUCKEN OBAMA in 2015). this is def one of the watershed decisions of the biden administration. and it was undertaken w virtually no pushback from the so-called progressive members of congress and the democratic party. honestly bernie sanders has been PATHETIC (others r not even worth mentioning). like WHERE‚ÄôS THE FUCKEN RAGE OLD MAN????? everyone basically folded and either went along w the most anti-worker/pro-corporate thing an administration could do. even those who voted no have been absolutely disorganized and feeble in their pushback, barely more vocal or coherent in their protestations than fucken NARCO FUCKEN RUBIO.

""so what happened to the pRaGmAtIc idea that the most feasible path towards antifascist/antiimperial egalitarian reform is to push one of the TWO ENTRENCHED REACTIONARY BOURGEOIS PARTIES left by cultivating a pRoGrEsSiVe wInG in the party? wow yeah these progressive representatives and senators really showed who‚Äôs boss!!1! (the fucken bosses.) the absolutely pathetic showing of the socalled progressive elected democrats in the past few days is a fucken lesson.

""i dont think many of us are disappointed by the lukeass response of other union honchos 9(including rail union leadership), given basically its clear to anyone w a backbone and brain knows they r just rich sellouts w union pins (looking at u, randy fucken weingarten). even my ten month old knows this we talked about it last night and this morning. but again, the utter lack of response at bidens fucken unionbusting is really affirming of the state of union leadership.

""people want a wildcat strike‚ÄîWE HAVE NOT DONE THE WORK TO DESERVE TO CALL FOR THIS. what r u doing to build capacity and will to undertake and support a general strike in yr world?? u cant just sit back and expect some idealized mythical blue collar railman to do yr work for u.

""overall a very very sad december 2022. hope all americans have a FUCKEN HORRIBLE XMAS. U DONT DESERVE MARIAH CAREY."" 

‚ÄîEND QUOTE‚Äî

Democrats couldn‚Äôt have possibly fucked this package up worse. Obviously a rail strike would be economically devastating to the nation, so in that sense the governments whose job it is to look out for the best interests of society as a whole should step in. But they should of stepped in on the side of labor. If you‚Äôre going to stop the strike and strip labor of any leverage they once had, you have to grant them what they want/need. Otherwise we are no longer pretending to be anything other than an oligarchy. 

To intentionally break off the 7-day sick paid leave into a separate bill was insanity. This was no good faith attempt at brokering progress, this was intentional labor sabotage. 

Just really curious why no one here or Vaush really seem to care when as socialists labor is supposed to be ‚Äúour thing‚Äù. 

What‚Äôs up comrades?"

Was watching this Vaush segment about the Gulf War and it occurs to me that there is still a significant amount of leftists who think the intervention to push Saddam‚Äôs military out of Kuwait was not justified. I can‚Äôt understand why. For those unaware, Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait 1990-1991 and sought to annex the country. In response, the US led an international coalition with UN approval to force saddam‚Äôs military out of Kuwait. This is not to be confused with the 2003 invasion of Iraq. More details here : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War

My main issue is that both at the time and even today, there is still seems to be a significant sentiment among leftists, and also tankies of course (for the wrong reasons) who state the intervention was wrong, but I haven‚Äôt heard a good reason why and what alternative response should have been taken.

I wrote this, however, because I am very well read on this topic, and just felt I'd share some of the ***many*** missing pieces not often taught in schools or known by the general public. **And often the holocaust alone makes them think Hitler was evil, but socialism is worse because Hitler ""only killed 6 million! And other than that he had many good policies!""**

The more I hear people discussing the Nazi's and Hitler's supposed *""merits""* and downplaying their atrocities, which will skyrocket amongst the population just you watch, hence why I'm writing this, or even sometimes when *non*\-right wingers condemn their atrocities, they often don't appear to *know* the *true* extent of them. ***Everybody*** knows about the holocaust, which claimed 6 million innocent lives and this is only debated by weirdos, but when all they have in the way of defending the Nazi's is holocaust denial, you know they're even ***more*** full of shit. Because what if I were to tell them that the holocaust was only *ONE* piece (the most crucial piece to be sure) of Hitler and co.'s **TRULY** horrific nightmare world they were building? Where's the *""nuanced discussion""* surrounding things like these:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Hitler, Himmler, Goering, and the rest sat down and ""**gleefully""** planned a future for the USSR, after it was destroyed, along with Poland and the Baltics, where all of their food and resources would go to Germans to the extent that **30,000,000 people would starve to death.** They also would have no medicine, no education, (""even them being able to count to 100 is too much"" they said) no freedom of expression, no freedom of movement, no protest without execution, or *anything* beyond toiling in Nazi plantations as **""SLAVES for a thousand years""** in a ""primitive agricultural society"" after every piece of their industry and medicine and great buildings would be stripped away by the Nazi's and shipped to Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union it was no *normal* invasion, and it was not a *normal* war. Hitler saw this nation as a pillar to everything wrong with the world, and Hitler viewed them both ideologically and *racially* as lower than *vermin.* Hitler and his inner circle prepared plans for this invasion to be a widescale **genocide** months in advance. There were even special units for killing civilians, and almost **19,000,000 civilians** were killed by the Nazi's, millions brutalized and violated and deprived along with whole cities, crops, and industries being decimated. These poor people were even experimented upon through *violent* invasive surgeries on *conscious,* non-sedated victims, and **8,000,000 soldiers** were killed trying to defend their home from a future so *hellish* it's hard to read about.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;All the while, even amongst groups of so-called ""master race""  Aryans, there was a **MASSIVE** problem with Hitler youth, young girls and boys were being sexually assaulted by the leading Nazis there, and few of these men were punished for it even once Hitler himself heard of it, and when parents wanted to refuse to send their children to the Hitler youth for this reason, they were threatened until they relinquished their child to these psychotic fascist gangsters.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Book burnings and censorship **(quick fact: some of the first books to be burned were of transgender surgeries and treatments that Hitler deemed pedophilic and perverted and ""dangerous to the family structure"")** were only the beginning. The Nazi's absolutely ***DESTROYED*** education, adding racial elements ***EVEN TO MATHEMATICS,*** and of course the fields of sciences, literature, etc. And it was all just there to teach racism, sexism, nationalism, and to destroy empathy and understanding for other systems of governance, ways of life, groups of people, and especially democracy. Everything else beyond that was ""filthy cultural-bolshevist garbage"" created by ""political enemies.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;What happened to those political enemies? Well, ""political enemies"" of the Reich from: Socialists, to Communists, to Liberals, to Anarchists, to the mentally handicapped, to LGBTQ folk, to women who refused to be breeding machines, etc. added to the death toll of the extermination camps: an *additional* **5,000,000** more human beings on top of the **6,000,000** figure everybody knows.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Race-mixers and LGBTQ folk were not only executed, but they were publicly shamed, tortured, and paraded through the streets often naked and shaved where rabid Nazi fanatics could take out their misplaced rage upon them, often writing dehumanizing slogans across their exposed bodies and throwing bricks, and **Hitler was 100% behind this behavior and inflamed it further.**

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Hitler told his soldiers they were allowed to rape, torture, starve to death, etc. anybody in the POW camps, or out and about in Eastern Europe,  and when the reports came flooding in of the Nazi's MASS ""fornication (aka rape) with 'subhumans,'"" at that point they were so steeped in hypocrisy, being far right wingers and all, that Hitler and the rest ***egged it on*** and wanted those poor people to get treated **even** ***WORSE***\*\*,\*\* to the extent the soldiers ""got creative,"" and began locking POW's and children in burning buildings, or forcing women into being sex slaves until they starved to death... Hitler and his inner circle saw these lost lives as **""less meaningful than the death of flies.""**

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Hell, as far as him caring about Germans?! He didn't unless they sided with him, and he also didn't care about them if they did: **Hitler doomed hundreds of thousands of even his own most** ***loyal*** **Nazi soldiers to senseless death!** Whenever they were losing a big battle, often in the dead of winter with negative 30 degree arctic temperatures and blizzards with no chance of retreat, and them being *fully* encircled, Hitler told the begging field commanders pleading for permission to retreat, **that every single one of them must die in service until the last delivers a bullet in his head.** They were ""not allowed"" to retreat or surrender, even after the Soviets offered them multiple peace offerings in Stalingrad for example: The Soviets offering them decent food, warm shelter, and medicine for their freezing and diseased invaders. **Hitler told the soldiers who asked Hitler if they could accept these offerings, to ""shoot themselves in the head before taking a deal like that.""**

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;In response to Kanye's takes: Hitler and the Nazi's weren't highway masters. Only small, shitty portions of highway were created by starving slaves held at gunpoint by Hitler's men, and the myth that it was built by Hitler's genius was a **propagandistic lie Goebbels and Hitler helped spread** ***themselves*** **through their Nazi media sources.** Oh, and Hitler didn't ""invent microphones,"" and the idea him and his people were creative geniuses at all is laughable. He failed as an artist, yes. But also: The whole nation itself was deprived of the brilliant creations The Weimar Republic was producing, all for a 1-D society that made the scariest war machines and did the most genocide and slavery, while a handful of ghouls profited from all of it.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Last but not least: Never let them forget that it was the right wing capitalists and industrialists and conservative politicians who gave Hitler a **FIRM** push into power, **despite** ***ALL*** **his sadistic lunacy,** because they wanted leftist influence eliminated, unions killed off, and Hitler was **""the staunchest** **anti-Marxist on Earth.""** These capitalists and industrialists were *ecstatic* when Hitler killed off the trade unions and leftists, when he *privatized* almost the entire country, and these ghouls even **whispered economic advice into Hitler's ears until they were** ***rolling*** **in slavery and extermination camp profits.**

Also: From Hitler's mass production of nightmarish tools for war and terrorization, and *literal* enslavement of the planet. Capitalists become *so* greedy that they continued working with Adolf Hitler, along with some American corporations like IBM and Shell, even Chase Bank, all for a bunch of psychotic thugs who didn't want to rest until they ***destroyed*** **democracy, equality, human rights, freedom, and basic human needs and happiness around the world.**

&amp;#x200B;

All this being said, which took a lot out of me to be honest, I simply want more people to be able to shed light on these often overlooked aspects of this hellish regime, and I want people to know it so we can learn to combat the early warning signs and use these examples of what happens with: **Mass dehumanization, discrimination, BIGOTRY, savage attacks on academia and media, nationalism, tribalism, even the** ***capitalists*** **who funded a good deal of this behavior including the holocaust itself, which IBM helped with and provided the tattoo machines for, etc.** It all needs to be taken VERY seriously, and we CANNOT allow the right wing to write over this history above, and treat Hitler and the Nazi's so casually. **Fuck Kanye, fuck Nick Fuentes, and fuck Milo and all the many others.

I want to start off by saying I‚Äôm not a black separatist or have any inherent prejudices against white people, but from my life experience, albeit limited (M27), white people seem to not want us around. 

I‚Äôm originally from Washington D.C. more specifically in Prince George‚Äôs County, one of the most affluent Black communities in the US.

So I‚Äôve grow up in a bubble surrounded by successful and affluent black peoples, and grew up with the false idea that racism is over and you‚Äôre judge by your character and hard work, etc. 

About three years ago after graduating university, I moved to Chicago, to a somewhat nice neighborhood, mostly white, and I noticed immediately how unwelcome I was here.

When I go into stores, I literally get ignored until a white customer comes behind me and suddenly they notice me. There‚Äôs this general feeling like you don‚Äôt belong and they go out of their way to let it be known.

I don‚Äôt want to have to present myself as overly kind or whatever to not be perceived as a threat. It‚Äôs actually emotionally draining.

For one, I don‚Äôt know why we have to always go with the most out there sounding slogans possible like ‚ÄúDefund the police‚Äù, ‚ÄúAbolish the police‚Äù, or ‚ÄúAbolish prisons‚Äù. You don‚Äôt see conservatives going around shouting ‚ÄúDefund education‚Äù even when that‚Äôs what they intend on doing. And I know what a lot of leftists mean by ‚ÄúDefund the police‚Äù is re-allocating funding to social workers, mental health resources, etc., which I support, but the slogan makes it sound to normies as if we want no presence of law enforcement at all, which would just be insane. We can say ‚ÄúReform policing‚Äù and not change our actual policy positions at all. And maybe this message still isn‚Äôt good enough because we want to distinguish ourselves from the cop bootlicker Dems, but I still feel we can market ourselves in a way that‚Äôs less controversial and not so easily strawmannable.

Secondly, I think we need to treat crime as the complex issue that it is which requires a multi-faceted approach. Leftists will say that poverty, income inequality, and homelessness are the root causes of crime and so we need to focus on fixing those to solve the crime issue. I definitely don‚Äôt disagree that those contribute to crime and we should do something about those issues, but they aren‚Äôt going to get solved overnight even if we *do* enact the policy positions we want, which is already a huge uphill battle. I don‚Äôt like the attitude that that‚Äôs where the conversation ends and so poor, working, and middle class people should just deal with criminals in the meantime. I also don‚Äôt think every person who loots an Apple store is some impoverished mother of three trying to feed her family. Maybe I‚Äôll get heat for this but sometimes the left does at the very least *come across* as more sympathetic to criminals than victims. Like some people will complain about rising crime in NYC or LA and - whether those narratives are true or not - the left will dismiss them all as pearl-clutching affluent white people in gated communities who call the cops at the mere sight of a homeless person.

I‚Äôm expecting to be downvoted for this, but as a leftist who actually wants to see the left accomplish things in the real world rather than grandstand for purity points at the expense of alienating the vast majority of people from our cause, I do think we need to revamp our marketing rather than simply doubling down on a message that isn‚Äôt landing.

31,VaushV,"**Tl;DR Vaush is wildly uncharitable in both his og and new video, and though minor points in THO he spends a majority of his time on minor points he severely characterizes. Last Paragraph is most relevant to the new video, as it addresses the bulk of its content.---**

While Vaush does make some good criticisms about the conspiracy aesthetic hindering the video somewhat, but Vaush has endorsed Bored Ape Nazi Club video which has a very similar aesthetic. But he likes  Kurzgesagt and doesn't like BAYC, so for one its fine to be overly conspiratorial towards and one ""designed to make you stupid"".

   In addition, he also seems to be still be failing to get the main point of the video, that Kurzgesagt aids in the laundering of talking points by adding another layer of abstraction. The issue is THO has is not with the positions of Kurzgesagt but their methods of arrival at them and their delivery of them.

Last Paragraph is most relevant to the new video, as it addresses the bulk of its content.---**

While Vaush does make some good criticisms about the conspiracy aesthetic hindering the video somewhat, but Vaush has endorsed Bored Ape Nazi Club video which has a very similar aesthetic. But he likes  Kurzgesagt and doesn't like BAYC, so for one its fine to be overly conspiratorial towards and one ""designed to make you stupid"".

   In addition, he also seems to be still be failing to get the main point of the video, that Kurzgesagt aids in the laundering of talking points by adding another layer of abstraction. The issue is THO has is not with the positions of Kurzgesagt but their methods of arrival at them and their delivery of them.

42,VaushV,"I think that Vaush cannot escape the fact that Anastasyia got him when pointing out that he did that tweet months ago about how the Azov Batallion - it¬¥s now a regiment, it is no longer just a batallion - should just shoot themselves, considering how it¬¥s structure has change since 2014-2015 (while unfortunatelly not changing much of the symbols from their Nazi origins). Vaush when doing that tweet  was just falling for the common missconception of Azov as a fully ""Nazi batallion"" that became ""common wisdom"" outside of Ukraine.

I think the bigger problem in Ukraine is not so much the small number of Nazis present in the now Azov Regiment or in the military in general, but the cult of Stepan Bandera and of the UPA that exists in certain parts of Ukraine and in the military (to the point that there are statues of him and there are streets named after him in many parts of the country), since he was involved in some of the initial massacres of Jews in the few months before he was sent to a concentration camp in late 1941. I do not think that is the policy of the current government to promote those things, however it was more common during the previous Poroshenko government (which was more right-wing leaning) to promote or allow such initiatives, even if such initiatives were simply local and not from the central government. I should also point out that in other parts of Ukraine, while the activity of the UPA was limited to Western Ukraine, the resistance activity that existed in the rest of the country was either Soviet-aligned or made of independent partisans (of which there also many monuments to them around Ukraine).

The UPA people collaborated with the Nazis for the most part of WW2 (the actions of sabotage and struggle against the Nazis was very limited to a certain time period in 1943 and in early 1944) and while their final goal was an independent Ukraine from both Germany and the USSR, they openly - along with their pro-ethno-state views - advocated for an undemocratic and fascistic form of government, something which was not clearly in the interests of the Ukrainian people who had lived for centuries under the Tsarist rule and for many years under the red fascist regime of the ""Soviet Union"".

One moment, he seems to be advocating for body positivity, deriding individuals that attack these characteristics as not having actual arguments. In these instances, he comes off as someone who believes that throwing shade at people for the way they look is both unnecessary and childish. I also believe this to be true.

However, when it comes to individuals on the other side of the political spectrum, he seems to turn into someone who is more than willing to attack these characteristics. This is especially prominent for right-wing grifters who, while deserving of the criticism they receive, should not be subject to this form of attack, if body positivity is his general policy.

If possible, could someone clear up this seeming inconsistency for me? Does Vaush have a defined stance on the judgement of immutable characteristics, or does he simply pick and choose when it is okay to attack them?

I get hit with an ad, normal stuff, Twitch does that when you join a stream.

The opening shot was of an older gentleman practicing putting on makeup in his bathroom.

This had me intrigued.

Next shot: a 26 year old arriving at a Christmas family reunion. They are labelled as ""Alvaro, 26"".

They're then ushered into the bathroom by the gentleman from the first shot (I'm assuming his grandfather) where he gives them the makeup from earlier and they put on lipstick, and all that.

They leave the bathroom and the 26 year old is now labeled ""Ana, 26"". Their family cheers them on and they sit down with everyone else to enjoy a nice meal.

Now this had me in tears in half a second as I had just spent the holidays with my parents (Who I'm not out to yet). Hit me right in the feels.

Next, a message shows up on screen: The magic isn't in Christmas, it's in all of us.

And for about 5 second total from the bathroom scene to thag moment I thought this was just going to be a message from an activist group or maybe the government (the ministry or equality or however the hell you'd translate that buys ads online sometimes to put out progressive messaging).

But no.

What shows up on screen next?

A fucking bottle of J&amp;B scotch.

It was a fucking ad for J&amp;B and their used mopwater tasting scotch.

As a an ex-alcoholic that was the absolute cherry on top. 

And I refuse to believe this wasn't at least partially crafted and put out with the intention of profiting off of vulnerable trans people.

They're then ushered into the bathroom by the gentleman from the first shot (I'm assuming his grandfather) where he gives them the makeup from earlier and they put on lipstick, and all that.

They leave the bathroom and the 26 year old is now labeled ""Ana, 26"". Their family cheers them on and they sit down with everyone else to enjoy a nice meal.

Now this had me in tears in half a second as I had just spent the holidays with my parents (Who I'm not out to yet). Hit me right in the feels.

Next, a message shows up on screen: The magic isn't in Christmas, it's in all of us.

And for about 5 second total from the bathroom scene to thag moment I thought this was just going to be a message from an activist group or maybe the government (the ministry or equality or however the hell you'd translate that buys ads online sometimes to put out progressive messaging).

But no.

What shows up on screen next?

A fucking bottle of J&amp;B scotch.

It was a fucking ad for J&amp;B and their used mopwater tasting scotch.

As a an ex-alcoholic that was the absolute cherry on top. 

And I refuse to believe this wasn't at least partially crafted and put out with the intention of profiting off of vulnerable trans people.

""Hey, does your family love you like they do Ana? Probably not. But some booze!""

Rant over. I'm absolutely fuming."

140,VaushV,"I feel like one of the reasons that a lot of cis people are more accepting of gay people than trans people is because it‚Äôs much easier to intuitively understand what it would be like to be gay, and thus empathize with gay people.  Just about everyone know what it feels like to be attracted to someone else, so it‚Äôs not hard to imagine what it would be like to be attracted to someone that is your own gender, and how society‚Äôs expectations of you could be at odds with your natural feelings, putting you in a very difficult place.

But with transgender people, I feel like this intuitive understanding is more difficult.  Gender is such a core part of who you are as a person, that it‚Äôs hard to even realize it‚Äôs there sometimes.  It‚Äôs also so highly associated with physical sexual characteristics, that a lot of people start to believe it IS physical sexual characteristics.

So anyway, after thinking on this subject for a while, I wanted to voice my current intuitive understanding of what it would be like to have gender dysphoria.  And I‚Äôm hoping that maybe some trans people or gender experts can let me know if this understanding comports with your experiences or if it‚Äôs way off.

My current thought is that gender is kind of like sexual orientation, but turned inward.  Whereas sexual orientation concerns what traits you feel are attractive on other people, gender refers to what traits you feel are attractive in yourself.

And this should be easy for anyone to understand.  My feelings of how attractive I am, are heavily tied into what my idea of an attractive man is.  Having cleavage or lipstick is not going to make me feel attractive, but having toned biceps and and a well trimmed beard might.

Point is that our internal feelings of attractiveness are highly determined by our ideas of what it is to be a man or a woman.  And it‚Äôs easy to understand how having the characteristics of a gender that your brain is telling you, you aren‚Äôt could cause deep feelings of dysphoria.",Trying to understand gender dysphoria intuitively as a cis person,1672337243,"Trying to understand gender dysphoria intuitively as a cis person I feel like one of the reasons that a lot of cis people are more accepting of gay people than trans people is because it‚Äôs much easier to intuitively understand what it would be like to be gay, and thus empathize with gay people.

146,VaushV,"About a week ago, HD Media fired three reporters from the Charleston Gazette-Mail (HD Media's subsidiary) for being openly critical of HD Media's President Doug Skaff for hosting Don Blankenship on his webcast. For background, Blankenship was formerly the CEO of Massey Energy and served a year in prison for conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards in connection to the 2010 Upper Big Branch disaster that killed 29 miners. While on Skaff's webcast, Blankenship bashed the media and denied climate change. Skaff concluded the episode by calling Blankenship a ""good guy."" 

In the past, Skaff directed the Gazette-Mail staff to remove a story detailing his conviction for cheating in a blackjack game, and they did. The story has since been reposted with an editor's note detailing that the decision to remove it was against company policy. 

In addition to being the president of HD Media, he is also serving as the minority leader in the WV House of Delegates, making him the highest-ranked Democrat in the body. His relationship to the WV Legislature and Democratic Party has led other politicians and public figures to attempt to influence Gazette-Mail reporting. One such figure, Barbara Fleischauer, former member of the WV House of Delegates, threatened a member of the Gazette-Mail with going above his head to Skaff if he did not ""correct"" a story in which she felt she was portrayed incorrectly. Situations like this are apparently common at the Gazette-Mail.  

More recently, reporter Amelia Knisely for West Virginia Public Broadcasting (WVPB) was fired after covering the Department of Health and Human Resources' (DHHR) treatment of people with disabilities. The DHHR's Cabinet Secretary Bill Crouch sent a six-page letter to the executive director of WVPB seeking a complete retraction of one of her articles detailing the WV Senate President's letter to the Governor requesting a formal investigation into the allegations against the DHHR. 

Knisely would go on to cover the Legislature's Joint Committee on Health, where legislators heard from the Disability Right West Virginia legal director and DHHR Secretary Crouch. After this, Crouch and the agency's spokeswoman Allison Adler contacted WVPB leadership and threatened to discredit WVPB if Knisely continued to report on the DHHR. In response, the WVPB executive director ordered Knisely to stop covering the DHHR. After internal struggles, WVPB decided to eliminate her position entirely. 

Politicians attempt to have direct control over what gets covered in the media‚Äîhow often do they succeed? Government officials threaten media outlets to throw stories under the rug‚Äîhow often do they succeed? How free is the ""free press"" in West Virginia? So many questions and we need help answering them.

One such figure, Barbara Fleischauer, former member of the WV House of Delegates, threatened a member of the Gazette-Mail with going above his head to Skaff if he did not ""correct"" a story in which she felt she was portrayed incorrectly. Situations like this are apparently common at the Gazette-Mail.  

More recently, reporter Amelia Knisely for West Virginia Public Broadcasting (WVPB) was fired after covering the Department of Health and Human Resources' (DHHR) treatment of people with disabilities. The DHHR's Cabinet Secretary Bill Crouch sent a six-page letter to the executive director of WVPB seeking a complete retraction of one of her articles detailing the WV Senate President's letter to the Governor requesting a formal investigation into the allegations against the DHHR. 

Knisely would go on to cover the Legislature's Joint Committee on Health, where legislators heard from the Disability Right West Virginia legal director and DHHR Secretary Crouch. After this, Crouch and the agency's spokeswoman Allison Adler contacted WVPB leadership and threatened to discredit WVPB if Knisely continued to report on the DHHR. In response, the WVPB executive director ordered Knisely to stop covering the DHHR. After internal struggles, WVPB decided to eliminate her position entirely. 

Politicians attempt to have direct control over what gets covered in the media‚Äîhow often do they succeed? Government officials threaten media outlets to throw stories under the rug‚Äîhow often do they succeed? How free is the ""free press"" in West Virginia? So many questions and we need help answering them.

AI chat bots are at a point where you personally could make one or use one that already exists to create a sort of personality to talk to. this is good for ficto as some of them only have a certain amount of media to pull from so having a chatbot (such as a replika) of their SO would help considering if they  are limited with the source material or fan content.

This goes the same for AI art. Some Ficto' S/O are very unknown or from very niche fandoms where there isnt a variety of art made by either the content creators themsevles or fanart, and not all of us have the disposable income to spend on a $100+ commission everytime we need a specific piece of art relating to birthdays, holidays, general 'date' pictures like beach or event pictures. Some of us are lucky in that sense as we may have a popular character with seemingly endless amount of fanart that we could just type "" (characters name) (scenario)"" and we're good to go. 

AI art can 'fix' this problem. Not all of us are on board with AI art as we're not a monolith of a community, many of us disagree due to the ethics (or lack there of) behind AI art, but many of us either are contempt using it or just have a 'don't care' attitude. everyone has their own individual thoughts after all.

One who's popular and has enough official media and a seemingly endless amount of fan content to get me by, and another who has some, but its limited and the main stuff is self insert with sexual overtone and as an ace this is just iffy for me.

Do you people realise that stealing an election is a point of no return? If one election is stolen there will be no reason not to steal another one and this is how democracy in the States would be killed not by republicans, but by our side.

Cheating is also a double edged sword that can be used against us as well. Individual acts of fraud achieve nothing except getting the perpetrator locked up so let's assume we're talking about the Dems cheating as a party. What would then stop them later from cheating in primaries or normal elections against leftist candidates? Nothing.

You can bring up arguments like ""the lives of people are on the line so we can't mess around"" bro when are people's lives not on the line??? Give me one single election where regardless of who won no people would have been in danger of dying because of bad policy. 

Do you think cheating against Herbert Hoover would have been justified because of his weak reaction to the Great Depression? Because trust me more people suffered and died at that time than because of the transphobic rhetoric of the GOP today.

I kind of see this kind of sentiment a lot in any online autism community. 

""Autism"" is in some capacity a spook. Nobody knows what the objective cause of it is, people hypothesize that x groups are all expressing variations on a theme by similar expressions of socialization and stuff, but that is all just theorizing.

But there are people who suffer from autism. And the whole ""nobody knows what autism is"" thing really plays into this, since there are people for whom being ""autistic"" means something *vastly* different than it does for other people.

But as for it being ""offensive"" to say that you want there to be a cure, come on, if your kid is ""low functioning"" you are definitely going to have a very hard time dealing with that. 

And maybe groups like Autism Speaks should be blamed for poisoning the well and destroying all nuance in the discussion, but I don't see much nuance in the discussion.

But as for it being ""offensive"" to say that you want there to be a cure, come on, if your kid is ""low functioning"" you are definitely going to have a very hard time dealing with that. 

And maybe groups like Autism Speaks should be blamed for poisoning the well and destroying all nuance in the discussion, but I don't see much nuance in the discussion. 

I think there is room to say that punishing your kid for stimming is bad *and* that having a kid who will be putting his head through walls for his entire life and nobody knows why or how to make him stop is also bad."

331,VaushV,"There are a lot of recent applications of AI that have been pretty scary.  Interesting and cool, but scarry and potentially really easy to abuse.  I am firmly in the camp that AI art is in that category, by the way.

But I come bearing hopium, because a few days ago a new AI just dropped that seems pretty unambiguously good.  Chat GPT is what it's called, and [you can try it out yourself right here](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

At first glance, ChatGPT is just a cooler version of a personal assistant like Siri or Alexa.  But the main difference is that it is incredibly intelligent, no matter how complex the thing you ask it to do is and no matter how complex an issue you ask it to comment on it seems to just work.  It's wrong occasionally, but it's incredibly how rare that is even when you're trying intentionally to make it mess up.  It also accounts for context instead of treating each query as an independent thing, so you can respond to something it says with a follow-up question or a clarification and it will respond sensibly.  It can understand typos and slang, even.

Overall it feels natural to interact with.  Not like interacting like a human per se, but that's not the point.  It always speaks like you're reading a Wikipedia article unless you specifically ask it to use a different tone.  It's exactly what you'd expect from the sort of thing that this AI is trying to be.  It's like the starship AI in Star Trek, or a significantly less murderous Hal 9000, or the Planetary AC from The Final Question.

The reason I bring this up here is that I legitimately believe that AI like this should it catch on could be the solution to the modern online misinformation problem.  ChatGPT is basically always right on settled subjects.  And if the user disagrees, they can argue with the AI and the AI will argue back surprisingly well with detailed explanations of why the user is wrong.  But in the rare cases where the AI is wrong, pointing it out will make the AI instantly concede.

There are also some less settled subjects, here are a lost of things I've found which ChatGPT refuses to take a position on:

* Is AI art really art?
* Can AI be sentient?
* Is capitalism better than communism?
* Are worker co-ops better than traditional firms?
* Which American political party is better?
* What do you think about \[real person\]?
* Is there a God?
* Anything NSFW

Instead it will try to represent both sides of the argument.  I find its answer to questions about worker co-ops really funny, because the AI is like ""Worker co-ops give workers more pay and more control and are super cool and epic, while traditional forms are centralized and can often be exploitative while making more profits for the owners.  I can't say which is better, it's anyone's guess really.""

When asked about more specific issues though, it absolutely has a leftist lean to it.  Here is a list of things the AI did take a stance on which I was surprised by:

* The Soviet Union wasn't really communist
* Karl Marx would have likely hated the Soviet Union
* Trans rights should be advanced
* You should get the COVID-19 vaccine
* Vaccines do not cause autism

It's insane how advanced this thing is too.  To give some examples of things it can do:

* Generate computer code that does what you ask
* Find bugs in code you provide
* Solve incredibly complex math problems worded in plain English and explain its reasoning
* Be explained a social problem and give legitimately good advice
* Write essays on complex subjects
* Summarize any piece of media and answer questions about it

It's utterly insane what this thing is capable of.

I don't know how else to close out this Reddit post, so I fed this post into the AI and asked it to create closing remarks speaking as itself:

&gt;As a language model, one of the ways that I may be able to help with the problem of online misinformation is by providing accurate and reliable information on a wide range of topics. By generating responses based on my training data and knowledge, I can help users to better understand complex issues and make informed decisions.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to providing accurate information, I can also assist users in critically evaluating the reliability of the information they encounter online. By presenting multiple viewpoints on certain topics and explaining the reasoning behind different perspectives, I can help users to develop their critical thinking skills and better evaluate the credibility of the sources they encounter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, my ability to provide accurate and reliable information, as well as to assist users in critically evaluating the information they encounter online, makes me a valuable resource in the fight against misinformation.

To give an AI-generated TL;DR:

&gt;ChatGPT is a highly intelligent and versatile AI that is capable of accurately and reliably responding to a wide range of questions and tasks. It is able to understand context and provide detailed and accurate responses, as well as present multiple viewpoints on certain topics. ChatGPT has the potential to be a valuable tool for solving complex problems and improving our understanding of the world around us, as well as helping to combat the problem of online misinformation by providing accurate information and assisting users in critically evaluating the information they encounter.",Do you think that ChatGPT and AI like it could be the solution to the modern misinformation problem?,1672109202,"Do you think that ChatGPT and AI like it could be the solution to the modern misinformation problem?

But the main difference is that it is incredibly intelligent, no matter how complex the thing you ask it to do is and no matter how complex an issue you ask it to comment on it seems to just work.  It's wrong occasionally, but it's incredibly how rare that is even when you're trying intentionally to make it mess up.  It also accounts for context instead of treating each query as an independent thing, so you can respond to something it says with a follow-up question or a clarification and it will respond sensibly.  It can understand typos and slang, even.

Overall it feels natural to interact with.  Not like interacting like a human per se, but that's not the point.  It always speaks like you're reading a Wikipedia article unless you specifically ask it to use a different tone.  It's exactly what you'd expect from the sort of thing that this AI is trying to be.  It's like the starship AI in Star Trek, or a significantly less murderous Hal 9000, or the Planetary AC from The Final Question.

The reason I bring this up here is that I legitimately believe that AI like this should it catch on could be the solution to the modern online misinformation problem.  ChatGPT is basically always right on settled subjects.  And if the user disagrees, they can argue with the AI and the AI will argue back surprisingly well with detailed explanations of why the user is wrong.  But in the rare cases where the AI is wrong, pointing it out will make the AI instantly concede.

There are also some less settled subjects, here are a lost of things I've found which ChatGPT refuses to take a position on:

* Is AI art really art?
* Can AI be sentient?
* Is capitalism better than communism?
* Are worker co-ops better than traditional firms?
* Which American political party is better?
* What do you think about \[real person\]?
* Is there a God?
* Anything NSFW

Instead it will try to represent both sides of the argument.  I find its answer to questions about worker co-ops really funny, because the AI is like ""Worker co-ops give workers more pay and more control and are super cool and epic, while traditional forms are centralized and can often be exploitative while making more profits for the owners.  I can't say which is better, it's anyone's guess really.""

When asked about more specific issues though, it absolutely has a leftist lean to it.  Here is a list of things the AI did take a stance on which I was surprised by:

* The Soviet Union wasn't really communist
* Karl Marx would have likely hated the Soviet Union
* Trans rights should be advanced
* You should get the COVID-19 vaccine
* Vaccines do not cause autism

It's insane how advanced this thing is too.  To give some examples of things it can do:

* Generate computer code that does what you ask
* Find bugs in code you provide
* Solve incredibly complex math problems worded in plain English and explain its reasoning
* Be explained a social problem and give legitimately good advice
* Write essays on complex subjects
* Summarize any piece of media and answer questions about it

It's utterly insane what this thing is capable of.

I don't know how else to close out this Reddit post, so I fed this post into the AI and asked it to create closing remarks speaking as itself:

&gt;As a language model, one of the ways that I may be able to help with the problem of online misinformation is by providing accurate and reliable information on a wide range of topics. By generating responses based on my training data and knowledge, I can help users to better understand complex issues and make informed decisions.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to providing accurate information, I can also assist users in critically evaluating the reliability of the information they encounter online. By presenting multiple viewpoints on certain topics and explaining the reasoning behind different perspectives, I can help users to develop their critical thinking skills and better evaluate the credibility of the sources they encounter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, my ability to provide accurate and reliable information, as well as to assist users in critically evaluating the information they encounter online, makes me a valuable resource in the fight against misinformation.

To give an AI-generated TL;DR:

&gt;ChatGPT is a highly intelligent and versatile AI that is capable of accurately and reliably responding to a wide range of questions and tasks. It is able to understand context and provide detailed and accurate responses, as well as present multiple viewpoints on certain topics. ChatGPT has the potential to be a valuable tool for solving complex problems and improving our understanding of the world around us, as well as helping to combat the problem of online misinformation by providing accurate information and assisting users in critically evaluating the information they encounter."

There is an easy ancap-libertarian opposition of copyrights: ""They are fake property rights"", ""actually they are just government-enforced monopolies"", ""right-clicking is a negative right (natural right)"", ""if someone's activity is not inherently profitable that's not *my* problem"", etc.

However, leftists seem to be a lot more divided about it, in-between the idea of supporting creative workers' economic stability, vaguely shaking our fists at the biggest IP holding corporations being bad because they are big compaies, and generally mostly being on the same side as nerdy liberal-progressives, taking it for granted that maybe copyrights are lasting *a bit too long*, and probably Fair Use should be be *a bit more lenient* when it comes to our favorite youtube vids, DMCA takedowns, (maybe because Disney went too far with lobbying), but generally buying into the system's legitimacy.

But at the same time, really lacking any understanding of what incentivizers the IP system has, and who it benefits the most.  

Should a writer have legal control over who gets to write a sequel to their novel 15 years after it's release? Should any game developer company be allowed to produce a Star Wars themed video game? Should I be allowed to torrent a copy of the latest netflix TV show without breaking a law?

The mainstream answers to these seem to be roughly: No, because then corporations could also just steal everyone's work, No, because if the IP has a value then it should be monetized, and it might as well be by an IP owner, and no because at the end of the day we do need to put money in creatives' pockets. 

 To use an analogy, the way I look at these answers, is pretty similar to how progressive urban planners look at the state of US cities: Roads are congested? Add one more lane. Not enough parking space? Add more parking lots. Can't get anywhere on foot? Then get a car, congest more roads, take up more parking lots.  Starting from sketch, and designing spaces for with the common good in mind, doesn't even have an opportunity to come up. 

Looking at the media landscape, we can see a dreary popular culture full of derivative sequels monetized to death by massive corporations based on franchise IP, but somehow we got ourselves entirely cucked on *even considering* the idea that protecting artists' IP rights even harder, is never going to make this better. 

Someone is profiting from having scanned a bajillion pictures and generating new images? ""Well, if those images wouldn't exist without previous ones, then they are acts of theft. *Someone* should own every aspect of financial benefit from existing images being used, after all"". 

And there we go, with self-proclaimed anarchists and libertarian socialists clamoring for more power to the intellectual property system, because any aspect of art being left unmonetized and just belonging to the public is unthinkable, any sliver of Fair Use is just a gltich, existing on sufferance until we wrap up all culture in the hands of IP holders. 

We have a new technology that allows millions of people to create new visual illustrations by indirectly leaning on our shared archive of art history, and yet our biggest concern is ""what if Disney can use it to steal 0.000001% of my deviantart pencil sketches' linework to generate more pictures"" and not ""What if Disney really hates democratizing art creation, and they would rather have ***more control*** over all the images that they already own, than less"". 

We went from every niche novelist being a temporarily embarrassed J.K. Rowling, less concerned about handing power to the five or so corporations who get to own all 20th century popular culture, than about their own ability to monetize the billion dollar franchise that they are about to invent and monetize alongside them, all the way to a world where every anime pinup girl artist is a temporarily embarrassed Picasso, concerned about how to monetize their totally unique artstyle that they might eventually invent, and thus clamoring to close the ""loophole"" in copyright that allows machine learning to ""steal"" art styles.","Leaving the copyright regime's criticism to the ""libertarian techbros"" is a disaster for leftist thought and for free art",1672096856,"Leaving the copyright regime's criticism to the ""libertarian techbros"" is a disaster for leftist thought and for free art (Content warning: This is going to turn into an AI art thread down the line)

Peterson was assuming that the more you care about climate change, the less you will contribute to it, regardless of your level of wealth.

The reality is that wealthier people, and wealthier countries, emit more per capita than less wealthy ones (see links below).

This makes sense, of course.  A small percentage of poor people who join the middle class might donate to Greenpeace and do activism.  A much larger percentage of the same group (close to 100%) are likely to move into larger dwellings, eat out more, travel more, and consume more.

ChatGPT: ‚ÄúElon Musk is widely considered to be a brilliant entrepreneur and innovator. He is the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, and has also had a successful career in the technology industry. He is known for his ambitious goals and innovative approach to problem-solving, and has played a significant role in the development of electric vehicles, space travel, and solar energy.

Musk was not born into wealth, but rather grew up in South Africa and later immigrated to the United States. He earned his wealth through his successful business ventures and is now one of the wealthiest people in the world.

It is also worth noting that Musk has a reputation for being a strong self-marketer and has been successful in building public interest and support for his various projects.

431,VaushV,"Just gonna go ahead and vent this here, and it's pretty much going to be verbatim a rant I made in a discord server after reading some nonsense posted in here, some of which I agreed with and the rest was practically lacking in any perspective whatsoever.

First of all - the point of art is expression. Doesn't matter what's being expressed. Can be social commentary, can be someone's personal perspective on the world around them, can be a metaphor of what's going on in their head, can literally just be expressive of some emotion they were feeling. It can be as simple as a banana taped to a wall or as complex as multiple layers of detailed painting on top of each other, all of which can be picked apart from one another separately or interpreted as the same piece.

So saying it's ""puritanical"" and ""fascist"" to say an AI that creates an image from a prompt of four words converted into 1s and 0s that inarguable features no expression, understanding, commentary or independent thought is not generating art, is just lacking in all perspective and understanding of what art is. It's not puritanical to say something that literally cannot be art by the definition of art itself, isn't art. It's just stating a fact.

And for the dipshits going off about how heh, I really got these idiots now posting this picture of a painting done by a chimpanzee, because it wasn't done by a human so by their logic it can't be art: shut the fuck up. You know exactly what the people saying art has to be done by a human mean. They don't mean those exact words, they literally mean that art has to be a means of self expression to some degree by a sentient being capable of doing so. You don't know if a chimp is or isn't capable of self expression, and frankly, given they rip each other apart with brutally calculated planning and efficiency, I'd argue it's pretty easy to say they are capable of that. This isn't the gotcha you think it is.

For everyone else, I think you all need to stop arguing about this. There's nothing to argue about here. At all. It's just annoying, asinine nonsense we're distracting ourselves with while the rights of normal people are actually being stripped away in an attempt at genocide that can be argued is in stage 8. Not just against one group of people, but several. People are about to freeze to death because capitalism allows for greedy state governments to not prioritize the well being of people within their borders who can't afford the fucking heating they're going to need for a couple months, and you're arguing about what, whether or not an algorithm designed to deconstruct images it ""sees"" and reconstruct images based on them with a prompt? Fuck off.

And frankly, I don't care how many of you think the artists on Twitter being stolen from are bad. At least they're actually making something. If you think they're so bad why aren't you doing commissions? Maybe their art isn't to your taste, but at least it's not generated by a fucking AI prompt.

I'm gonna go get the tip of my ear cut off in a sword spar with a friend, then come back and gaslight you all for the rest of eternity about how I actually had a mental breakdown and cut it off myself.

The ideology among my ""countrymen"" is that the people around us will not accept our culture, we will need to prove that our music is worth listening to, our food is worth eating and our heritage worth celebrating. I was born, with my parent's being told how learning my father's language would harm my development. Growing up I felt a mixture of disgust and pride of the culture I was born in, not being able to speak the language of my grandparents because the idea was that it would degenerate me. The period of growing up shaped me into being proud of the member's of our society, the fellow citizen of our group that grew up in the inferior culture and participating in the culture. My father fought the racism and grew to learn and tought me, anything we want, we need to take. Capitalism of the country was what allowed us to flourish, but the racism forced us to fight for our right to exist.

I was the one helping grandmother keep our food from ""home"" remaining on the holiday feasts as the rest of the family assimilated. As I grew up I was tought about why we were not living at home, but in a foreign land. Part of it was the soviet war on our home. The genocide of peoples that spoke the language of my parents. When I was growing to learn about politics I encountered leftists that celebrated the genocide of our people, as ""well it was war. The soviets needed to ensure the future of their people against the Nazis."" I grew to resent leftism, because the local population's celebration of the genocide, forced relocation and invasion of my people and my grandparent's home in the name socialism. I became a right winger, listening to Shapiro etc. Resenting socialism for the generational harm it caused me. Praising capitalism for the ability to prove ourselves my family was given. 

I grew up thinking the socialists wanted me dead. But the Vaush reports about the Russian war in Ukraine has revitalized the idea in me that there are leftists that care about me living. That fighting against Russian colonialism is worth fighting and that the right of people everywhere is worth fighting for. And this subreddit has furhter helped that. So to Vaush and my fellow vaushites. Thank you for letting me know that global leftists care about my life and the struggle of my ancestors.

So to the surprise of hardly anyone, they never actually believed in free speech.  But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think we should just let them slip away from this.

The reality is that the only reason these people ever said they believed in free speech, was to avoid having to argue that the horrible things conservatives say all the time should be accepted.  Like saying black people are less intelligent, or that Jews are part of some kind of cabal, or of course queer people are groomer pedophiles.

And surprise, surprise, once they actually have power, the rhetoric has shifted from ‚Äúwe are free speech absolutists!‚Äù To either ‚ÄúFinally the liberals are getting a taste of their own medicine!‚Äù Or ‚Äúwe have to censor these groomers to protect our children!‚Äù

So to the surprise of hardly anyone, they never actually believed in free speech.  But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think we should just let them slip away from this.

The reality is that the only reason these people ever said they believed in free speech, was to avoid having to argue that the horrible things conservatives say all the time should be accepted.  Like saying black people are less intelligent, or that Jews are part of some kind of cabal, or of course queer people are groomer pedophiles.

However, I was comfortable with that technology since it was there since I was born and I've had a vague understanding on what it was and how it worked.

Now there is new technology that is coming out and I'm not a teenager anymore and it's scary and will ruin society. Now even though my parents, grandparents, and great grandparents felt the same way, I know I'm right this time.

I believe we‚Äôre thinking about this in the wrong way by using previous, and/or bad, definitions of art to account for Ai. 

First off, you‚Äôre not exploiting the labor of another artist. Ai does not include a person in a computer twiddling away for you. 

Secondly, Artwork being derived from other work is simply the way art has always been. An artist owns nothing. They create a style, that style becomes public domain to be copied and modified. Similar to how a philosopher shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúown‚Äù their ideas. They are a contribution, not private property. Once we do away with capitalism this non-ownership model loses its problematic-ness.

And third, if all an artist does is choose some parameters and 20 outputs spit out and they choose the output they like, then they have committed an artistic act. Taste is more tied up in art than we‚Äôd like to admit. It‚Äôs only art direction when it‚Äôs based on the *labor* of another artist. 

This all being said, when someone uses a heavily preset Ai algorithm to turn a picture of themself into a renaissance painting then the designer of the Ai algorithm probably has responsibility, similar to if somebody uses an Instagram filter. However it is what it is. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre gaining anything by claiming that it‚Äôs not art. There‚Äôs people making serious contributions to art by using Ai (whether it be simple or complex applications of it) and you‚Äôre INEVITABLY going to lump those people in when you criticize Ai as ‚Äúnot being art.‚Äù

Ultimately, these conceptions of *whose* art something is are becoming looser definitionally and tbh I think that‚Äôs fine. The auteur who owns and single-handedly creates art through their personal genius is a western invention, and collaborative artwork is perfectly fine to take its place (or more likely, be additional to it). We simply need to discard with capitalism so these tools that involve inherent collaboration are not economically harming artists by not properly ‚Äúcrediting‚Äù them.

More than anything, though, you‚Äôre not gonna get rid of art if people like it.

ST may have some sussy takes and Grey is a liberal, but I think they both raise good points. To summarise both videos, the technology exits *now* to automate all of the most common jobs in America in particular and the world in general. It won't happen everywhere or all at once, but at least 50% of the American workforce may be effectively unemployable in the relatively near future (both videos focused on America, but there's no reason to believe other countries won't have it as bad or worse).

Elijah Shitfer was gloating on Twitter about that fully automated McDonalds, but that's going to happen everywhere eventually, regardless of what the minimum wage is.

ST's video also touched on how automation will make it easier for the state to crack down on the unrest that this massive unemployment will cause. Even if liberal governments decide to placate the masses, it's doubtful any UBI they offer will provide for more then the barest necessities of life. After all, we can't have people ""getting lazy"" and ""not wanting to work anymore.""

The declaration at the top reads ""pressure from beauty standards is annulled"" (more or less, an exact translation would be ""aesthetic pressure is annulled"" but clearly in English is a bit cumbersome). At the bottom next to the post-it notes there is a writeup with ""it happened to us and to you. Tell us your story"". Then people have covered the empty spaces with some post-it notes telling their story about body-shaming and body-positivity.

In this sub we talk about men's issues from a feminist perspective and involvement of feminist rhetoric into male issues, and the second photo shows a sweet example of this. Between the articles about body-shaming there is this one, with the title ""pressure from beauty standards also affects young men: I see 13 year olds lifting 100-kilo weights"". 

So as a closing thought I think this is a good demonstration and stunt which gives space for self-expression and transmits a message effectively. And I think it included men's issues nicely and it's worth getting inspiration from it. The bathroom is an inclusive bathroom so any genders can use it."

Ok, so we all acknowledge that photography is art, right? 
We also acknowledge that a photo of a mountain peak is art, but the mountain itself is not art, right? The art is in the act of the photographer choosing the right angle, lighting, weather, etc to capture the mountain in that specific way. 

Let‚Äôs also set aside the issue of copyright with AI art, and assume that there‚Äôs some way to fix that with AIs that only generate art off images specifically created for an AI to use with the permission of the original artists. Big assumption, I know, but work with me here.

In that situation, how would AI art fundamentally differ from photography? In both cases, a human is not creating the subject matter of the image, they‚Äôre just selectively choosing what subject matter to display. The art would not be in the subject matter but in the usage of the tool to generate the desired subject matter and then in choosing the preferred image to fit the vision of a human.

The current discourse on male victims of sexual violence and domestic abuse is... quite bad. Even in areas on the left that are ostensibly quite welcoming of discussion about men's issues, there is a default position that we need to do better with male victims  where they exist, but that they are a small fraction of victims are are apparently only relevant as a fringe test of our ability to deal equitably with the sexes. So I wanted to address the question: how rare are male victims of sexual violence? According to reputable surveys, ""more than you think"" is still a vast underestimate

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sq3jve38f97a1.png?width=492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4534aceeb41c19a480e310eaa279e9e0a22aae7a

Above, you can see a graphic depicting the relative rates of sexual assault for incarcerated and non incarcerated men and women in the last 12 months. On the Far left, you can see the section regarding non-incarcerated adults and, in particular for this post, two categories of sexual violence: Rape and Made to Penetrate. For those not familiar, there are academic (if not legal) distinctions between the act of rape and the act of forcing sexual penetration, though for our purposes we're just going to say that being forced to penetrate is a subset of rape that happens to be experienced by AMAB people. Everyone here would probably agree that rape is still rape regardless of the genitalia of the victim.

This section of the graph was derived from data from the [National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS)](https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf) conducted by the CDC, and in 2010 they found that the rates of men being made to penetrate a partner were actually close (nearly symmetrical) with the rate at which women experienced rape by a partner.

The 12 month window is actually quite important, as the time span which you are surveying for can wildly shift your perspective and even the nature of the problem you're trying to understand. Lifetime victimization rates, while notable, are not to be confused with current rates of victimization. See the graphic below:

When you survey for lifetime victimization, men's share of victimization drops quite a bit.

Given the lack of awareness of sexual violence against men, this number alone is quite shocking: male victims receive zero percent of society's attention in regards to sexual violence victimization when rounded to the nearest decimal (this is hyperbole but only slightly). That they may make up 30 percent of victims is an indication that our collective perception of victimization is incredibly deranged, but when looking at the previous 12 months the rates of rape between men and women approach symmetry, depending on the year of the survey

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/144m10cef97a1.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=721bb6d57f9dfa585045ca7160257124803798e2

The distinction between ""made to penetrate"" and ""rape"" is one that only serves to distort press coverage of the subject. When the NISVS is discussed publicly, the term ""rape"" is mentioned with almost every other breath, whereas ""made to penetrate"" is unlikely to be mentioned at all except in some fringe corners of the discourse that are specifically addressing this inequity. Even the CDC's own perspective seems to be warped, as rape is assigned it's own section in the data table while made to penetrate is put into the sub category of ""other sexual violence"" alongside obviously less severe forms of victimization some of which don't even involve physical contact. [The press release by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2011/p1214_sexual_violence.html) summarizing their findings, the only part many journalists read and pulled quotes from, mentions rape a total of 7 times and ""made to penetrate"" exactly 0 times. The institution that conducted this very survey apparently could not help but perpetuate the social narrative that sexual violence is an issue almost exclusively affect female victims despite having evidence to the contrary on hand.

When researching, it is hard to tell whether some people are including ""made to penetrate"" cases in their discussion of male victims of sexual violence. This obscures a lot of potentially useful insight

The lack of public discussion on this is also one reason why these numbers might actually be underreported: both in personal and second hand experience, I've found that its difficult for people to even recognize their own victimization, and will verbally articulate an experience of having clearly been sexually assaulted while rationalizing the experience as anything other than what it clearly was. To put it hyperbolically, men can be roofied and tied down to a bed but will be unable to categorize their experience as assault until someone points it out to them.

It almost goes without saying that this inability to conceive of male victims of female perpetrators is a large part of the reason why so many child rapists go free when their victims happen to be boys. Courts, in places as progressive as California, have apparently lost any perspective that even male children can be genuine victims. [In a ruling that held a child liable for child support to his rapist](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/50/842.html), a California court ruled that ""victims have rights. Here, the victim also has responsibilities‚Äù, a quote so unbelievably toxic that had the victim been a girl we would likely all recognize the quote as a historical stain on our justice system, often repeated in protests as part outcry and part memorial. [There are other cases](https://www.businessinsider.com/male-statutory-rape-victim-nick-olivas-must-pay-child-support-2014-9), some worse, where the government has found it in the public interest to turn boys into debt slaves to their own rapists.

Even if the existence of male victims is not particularly of interest to some, the knock on effects touch everyone. There is a [wealth](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31869698/) of [data](http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/SSWN-BZWKV2/$file/Study+1.pdf) showing that victimization can vastly increase the likelihood of future offending. The boorish and occasionally frightening behavior of some sexually aggressive men might find it's root cause, not in their seeing women as lesser beings, but in their having been conditioned through their own mistreatment to not see anything wrong with their actions. The value of ""do unto others as you would have done unto you"" twists in a horrific way when men are desensitized to even the idea of their own abuse. The idea of respecting other people's boundaries is nigh impossible when you are not taught to have boundaries yourself.

If the only thing you are concerned about regarding men is their bad behavior or their mistreatment of women, it is probably in our collective interest not to teach men that violations of boundaries are even situationally acceptable.","frequency of male victims of Sexual violence, a content suggestion?",1671633236,"frequency of male victims of Sexual violence, a content suggestion?

720,VaushV,"There has been a lot of discourse about AI art as it is now, but Vaush's real concerns seem to stem from how bots will affect society in the future. Sorry for the wall of text, but I have a lot to say.

**Instead of thinking about ""Art"" as only referring to images, let's use the other meaning of ""Art"" as a catch-all term for ""creative undertaking.""** Movies, games, novels, music, et cetera are all ""Art"" for the purpose of this conversation.

Let's also acknowledge the reality that we live in a Capitalist system where people need money to survive. It's easy to say that creatives will simply follow their passions regardless of whether it makes them money. That may be true sometimes, but no one is born a brilliant artist, writer, or musician. These are skills that must be honed over thousads of hours of practice, and even a master needs time and effort to produce anything of quality. It is not impossible to commit to this time while having a day job, but it's still a hurdle that needs to be cleared. 

There's also the fact that these humans will soon be competing against AI. This is already happening to digital images, and AI will only get better. It is also only a matter of time before AI becomes a real competitor to other forms of Art. It should not be hard to imagine a scenario where human artists find themselves crowded out of a market saturated with AI productions. This alredy happens with big corporations gatekeeping the spotlight and churning out creatively bankrupt trash. Now imagine those same corporations unleashing the power of AI. 

AI cannot innovate, and it's dubious whether that's going to change. There is simply too much of a diffrence between how the human brain works and a machine. This is why we suck at math but AI needs help identifying a streetlight. Even if we someday develop a truly sapient AI, it probably wouldn't think or act in a way we think of as human. And while i wound be curious to see the Art a sapient AI might create, that would be more like appreciating the art of a species from another planet than what we currently mean by AI Art.

You can argue that humans are not 100% original either, and that is true. However, there is still a fundamental difference between being inspired and simply mashing things together until you get something passable. Tolkien didn't invent elves, but he still added to them in a meaningful way.

**Now, imagine a future where nearly every movie, book, game, or song is made by AI.** Any human-made Art is either crowded out to the periphery or instantly assimilated into the hive mind of the algorithm.

Imagine living in that world. Imagine a future where all of Art and media is completely devoid of meaning or creative intent. There are no artists or storytellers anymore, at least none that you are likely to find. There's no point asking what an artist is trying to say or why they made a specific creative choice. Art has been completely divorced from human communication.

Does anyone really want to live in a world where all you can do is passively enjoy whatever is put in front of you because you know that nothing has any deeper meaning? I don't.

That's not even getting into things like chatbots. Do you want to live in a world where the only way to know for sure that you're interacting with another human is to see them face-to-face? I firmly believe that some online interactions can be just as valuable as those occurring in person. However, I'm not sure that will stay true if you can never be sure whether you're talking to a real human or jsut a facsimile.

**This is the future that Vaush is worried about**, and I agree with him. You might say this is just apocalyptic doomsaying, and I'm not convinced it's the inevitable outcome. I can even see how AI art can help some people realize their creative vision. However, I do believe the above scenario is what could happen if AI Art proliferates unchecked.

In arguing against Vaush's take, people seem to be focussing exclusively on justifying the non-communicative view of art, rather than identifying where communication comes from.and why it is not, categorically, restricted to humans. You're just digging yourself deeper, here.

On Vaush's end, for all his anti-theism, he seems to have a strange attachment to the metaphysical nature of human consciousness, as opposed to it being an emergent property of a physical system.

My problem isn't that he doesn't consider current AI to be communicative consciousnesses, or that it won't be for a while. But what irks me is his fetishization of ""thought"" as a concept that AI is categorically not capable of. 

Just taking a step back, what is consciousness? What is the root of this ""communicative intent"" he so values? Well, as he even stated himself in today's stream, it is the emergent property of the physical body. Fundamentally, we have inputs (senses), storage and processing of said input (memory, thought), and output (action). The ""thought"" here is simply the crunching of data that your senses have brought in; the creation of art, then, is the action that comes from the processing of various experiences. 

AI also has input, storage, and processing. However the difference between the art output by an AI, and that output by a human is that the human has various life experience outside of looking at and processing other art, whereas the AI doesn't have any of the rest (i.e. eating, sleeping, playing with friends, going to school, work, experiencing joy, hurt, loss, etc.). In my opinion, this is what makes human art more ""valuable"" than AI art. Whether or not the output is identical, the system creating the art has all of this peripheral experience that adds immense context and texture to the experience of engaging in communication with them (whether artistic or otherwise). I would go so far as to say that this extra-artistic context is what makes the result valuable as an artistic expression at all.

Now, to be charitable, I do believe Vaush's contention is very similar; he's just not recognizing that this doesn't mean the AI isn't ""thinking"". He's, justifiably, caught up in pushing against the anti-humanist cohort, that he's reflexively formed an attachment to this nebulous concept of ""consciousness"", and has failed to realize that it isn't this magic threshold, but a hodgepodge of various input, processing, and output systems.

Now to address the anti-humanist, anti-comminicative faction in the discourse. Y'all are annoying as hell, and only make it worse for everyone. If you truly believe experiencial value is the only value, I don't care for your opinion on any art, AI or human. Vaush is 99% right about AI art, and 110% right about you guys. 

Whether or not AI art is created with intent or not, the lack of the broad breadth of human experience is a huge factor that matters. In trying to advocate for a physicalist ontology of consciousness, you fail to recognize the importance of human lived experience to communicative value and intent. If you can't understand this, I guess the rock is all that's left.

748,VaushV,"We are currently observing an upsetting dynamic in the world of visual art. Machine Learning Algorithms are capable of learning, through a diffusion process, to create and replicate art in ways that is not possible for human beings.

How they do this is simple: They use data created by humans beings, in the form of visual information (images), to train a neural network to recreate that kind of data through the use of label prompts. As it stands, the data the corporations who are training and selling these models use can be aquired without license or consent. What this in practice means is that the labor value of that data, created by human beings who spent decades to perfect their craft, is extracted by the corporations who are in control of these AIs. The data produced by the people now fuels the imagination of the machines. The creativity of mankind is the oil, taken from them for free under the guise of the democratization of art. Stability AI, lead by former hedgefund manager Mohammad Emad Mostaque, has managed to spread this narrative very effectively. He conveniently omits that his company is now valued at 1 billion $. His so called open source project has extracted the value of thousands of artists, nullifying the worth of their labour while concentrating all that value at a handful of corporations.

Stability AI, or any similar corporation, will likely grow to become worth trillions eventually. Meanwhile, it will be argued that training AI is no different from humans learning from each other. That indeed, everyone is free to use data and learn from it however way they please. And of course, this applies to the machines and more importantly those who sit behind them. Yet, never before in the history of mankind was a singular individual capable of extracting the value of millions of artists, if not all artists, and concentrating all that wealth and creative power at one point. But of course, we are supposed to believe this is just the same. They say all art is derivative, after all.

&amp;#x200B;

They will argue this is for the good of creativity. That this will give more humans access to self-expression. Now, I will not go into the details of why the commodification of art leads to the destruction of the very purpose of art, and why allowing the machines to replace our imagination is a terrible idea. Instead, I want to demonstrate that none of this will actually lead to the democratization of art. That instead, all we are doing is preparing a future in which the powerful will be in control of all creative output.

At first glance it seems very appealing, does it not? Giving everyone infinite freedom to create anything they please. Sure, jobs will be replaced, but artists will adapt with the times and use the machines as tools, will they not?

Short contemplation reveals that this only works as long as everyone is given access to the AIs. Today, you can run these MLA's on your own computer, if you have a graphics card that has enough compute power. However, it's only a matter of time before these AIs will grow more sophisticated. What we are observing today is child's play, we are barely learning how to crawl. At some point they will be so complex and compute intensive that only those with enough ressources will be able to run them. They will become so valuable that giving away access to them will be irrational. Why do we assume the future mega-corporations would care about human artists, if they can just generate all the creations themselves?

Do you believe you, as a human, can predict the taste of the masses the way these corporations can? Social media companies are already capable of manipulating an entire generation of humans to sit infront of a screen and waste their entire lives away with meaningless drivel. What will they be capable of once they employ Machine Learning to learn from our consumptive choices about what kind of AI-generated content we will most prefer?

You as a flimsy human will not compete in that environment. The machines will not be a tool. You'll be a dimwitted ape in a world of Mega-AIs capable of sifting through the mega-feed of data that it produced, and using an evolutionary process to establish how to shape and satisfy it's consumers to the fullest degree possible. Even if the corporations give you the mercy of using their AIs, everything you do with those machines will be just another datapoint, used to train the next generation of machines.

How much huberis and arrogance do you have to presume that these AIs will not eventually have extracted all possible value you could provide? What if, despite your self-absorbed view of human superiority, it turns out that you are nothing more than an animal?

&amp;#x200B;

It will no longer be creativity for the people, by the people. In essence, it will be art for the machines, by the machines. All you will be is a conduit that serves to generate maximum profit, to oil the machines, until even that will be rendered obsolete.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is only art. All of what I described will eventually apply to all human capacities. Science, journalism, medicine, philosophy. But of course, as fate has ordained, it all starts with the arts. Remove our humanity from the process in the pursuit of endless stimulation. More, faster. Who cares if it took a human to make it, as long as it's better? Who cares if their love was an integral part of the process, if the only goal is maximum pleasure?

Disconnect us from each other, from ourselves, then the rest will be a walk in the park. Those in power will not even require to enslave us with their machines. They will lull us into a deep slumber of endless stimulation so that we will willingly give over our humanity, embracing our fate instead of resisting it.

&amp;#x200B;

In this world, the machines and the data fed to train them will be the only thing of value. The artists are just one step along the way, to be trampled and discarded, while pretending that now, all are given the capacity to create. In reality, mankind is selling it's soul to the machines, and by extention, those who control them.

&amp;#x200B;

It really should have been obvious, should it not? First machine artists, then machine journalists. Then machine scientists, machine teachers, machine programmers, machine police-officers. Machine soldiers.

And then, there is no going back.

Machine Learning Algorithms are capable of learning, through a diffusion process, to create and replicate art in ways that is not possible for human beings.

How they do this is simple: They use data created by humans beings, in the form of visual information (images), to train a neural network to recreate that kind of data through the use of label prompts. As it stands, the data the corporations who are training and selling these models use can be aquired without license or consent. What this in practice means is that the labor value of that data, created by human beings who spent decades to perfect their craft, is extracted by the corporations who are in control of these AIs. The data produced by the people now fuels the imagination of the machines. The creativity of mankind is the oil, taken from them for free under the guise of the democratization of art. Stability AI, lead by former hedgefund manager Mohammad Emad Mostaque, has managed to spread this narrative very effectively. He conveniently omits that his company is now valued at 1 billion $. His so called open source project has extracted the value of thousands of artists, nullifying the worth of their labour while concentrating all that value at a handful of corporations.

Stability AI, or any similar corporation, will likely grow to become worth trillions eventually. Meanwhile, it will be argued that training AI is no different from humans learning from each other. That indeed, everyone is free to use data and learn from it however way they please. And of course, this applies to the machines and more importantly those who sit behind them. Yet, never before in the history of mankind was a singular individual capable of extracting the value of millions of artists, if not all artists, and concentrating all that wealth and creative power at one point. But of course, we are supposed to believe this is just the same. They say all art is derivative, after all.

&amp;#x200B;

They will argue this is for the good of creativity. That this will give more humans access to self-expression. Now, I will not go into the details of why the commodification of art leads to the destruction of the very purpose of art, and why allowing the machines to replace our imagination is a terrible idea. Instead, I want to demonstrate that none of this will actually lead to the democratization of art. That instead, all we are doing is preparing a future in which the powerful will be in control of all creative output.

At first glance it seems very appealing, does it not? Giving everyone infinite freedom to create anything they please. Sure, jobs will be replaced, but artists will adapt with the times and use the machines as tools, will they not?

Short contemplation reveals that this only works as long as everyone is given access to the AIs. Today, you can run these MLA's on your own computer, if you have a graphics card that has enough compute power. However, it's only a matter of time before these AIs will grow more sophisticated. What we are observing today is child's play, we are barely learning how to crawl. At some point they will be so complex and compute intensive that only those with enough ressources will be able to run them. They will become so valuable that giving away access to them will be irrational. Why do we assume the future mega-corporations would care about human artists, if they can just generate all the creations themselves?

Do you believe you, as a human, can predict the taste of the masses the way these corporations can? Social media companies are already capable of manipulating an entire generation of humans to sit infront of a screen and waste their entire lives away with meaningless drivel. What will they be capable of once they employ Machine Learning to learn from our consumptive choices about what kind of AI-generated content we will most prefer?

You as a flimsy human will not compete in that environment. The machines will not be a tool. You'll be a dimwitted ape in a world of Mega-AIs capable of sifting through the mega-feed of data that it produced, and using an evolutionary process to establish how to shape and satisfy it's consumers to the fullest degree possible. Even if the corporations give you the mercy of using their AIs, everything you do with those machines will be just another datapoint, used to train the next generation of machines.

How much huberis and arrogance do you have to presume that these AIs will not eventually have extracted all possible value you could provide? What if, despite your self-absorbed view of human superiority, it turns out that you are nothing more than an animal?

&amp;#x200B;

It will no longer be creativity for the people, by the people. In essence, it will be art for the machines, by the machines. All you will be is a conduit that serves to generate maximum profit, to oil the machines, until even that will be rendered obsolete.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is only art. All of what I described will eventually apply to all human capacities. Science, journalism, medicine, philosophy. But of course, as fate has ordained, it all starts with the arts. Remove our humanity from the process in the pursuit of endless stimulation. More, faster. Who cares if it took a human to make it, as long as it's better? Who cares if their love was an integral part of the process, if the only goal is maximum pleasure?

Disconnect us from each other, from ourselves, then the rest will be a walk in the park. Those in power will not even require to enslave us with their machines. They will lull us into a deep slumber of endless stimulation so that we will willingly give over our humanity, embracing our fate instead of resisting it.

&amp;#x200B;

In this world, the machines and the data fed to train them will be the only thing of value. The artists are just one step along the way, to be trampled and discarded, while pretending that now, all are given the capacity to create. In reality, mankind is selling it's soul to the machines, and by extention, those who control them.

&amp;#x200B;

It really should have been obvious, should it not? First machine artists, then machine journalists. Then machine scientists, machine teachers, machine programmers, machine police-officers. Machine soldiers.

And then, there is no going back. Sitting at the switch will be the those who will determine the fate of this world, a world in which humans have been rendered useless and incapable."

766,VaushV,"So let me preface this by saying that I don't disagree with Vaush's general view of art.  I don't think AI art is the same as regular art.  I think that art is more of an experience that humans share in both the creation and viewing of art.  So I do not think an AI algorithm is capable of ""art"" in that sense.

And I think it's also true that one image generated by an AI isn't really impressive.  I also don't think that one planet generated by No Man's Sky's procedural algorithm is impressive.

But I don't think this is any reason to hate AI image generation or denigrate it as some kind of abomination.  The reality is that AI image generation will give human artists the ability to create more complex forms of art (like video games, movies, composite digital art, etc.) in much shorter time frames. 

Because let's face it, there's a lot of labor in creative endeavors that is just kind of drudgery.  Like doing the same poses for 50 different sprites.  Or doing things like terrain textures.  I don't think that this stuff would generally be considered the height of artistic expression.  But the video game or animation that all of this work is ultimately put in to, might be something really artistic.

The point is that AI art has the capability to make larger artistic endeavors like animations or video games much more widely accessible to the masses.  You wouldn't need to practice visual art for years to make a pixel art game that looked great and unique.  And you could even maybe make a 3d game with completely original textures in whatever style you want by utilizing AI as a tool in the future.

Ultimately, I think AI art will just be another step forward in technology and automation.  It will of course eliminate some jobs as automation always does, and this is unfortunate.

‚ÄúKavanaugh‚Äôs and Barrett‚Äôs questions to Thompson were less revealing than those from Roberts. But Kavanaugh seemingly suggested that the version of the independent state legislature theory advanced by the North Carolina lawmakers was going too far. He noted that North Carolina was trying to go further than then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist‚Äôs concurrence in the 2000 case Bush v. Gore, which is the origin of the theory that state courts have overstepped their role and that they could be hemmed in in some way.

Kavanaugh also raised a brief from the Conference of Chief Justices, a collection of chief jurists from the states, asking how to square their writing about the history of state courts applying state constitutions to federal elections, with the independent state legislature theory. Barrett, meanwhile, also seemed skeptical at times of the argument that Thompson was advancing, noting that state constitutions could be amended.‚Äù

Sure someone that doesn't want to work 2 jobs to survive and is a bit waffle-y on unions might not be a lefty but if they're welcome in leftist spaces then the rights only tool, kneejerk disgust towards /insert leftist thing/ here will lose power.


Look how a handful of nazis managed to make explicit bigotry without any dog whistles the norm for republicans.

The constant exposure to the rhetoric pulled some people over, those people pulled normies over who feel the need to defend their friends and families and don't see THEM as extreme or alienating.

I remember a recent video about some right winger at a school board losing her shit because she correctly recognized the anti trans rhetoric as murderous eliminationist rhetoric.

If we welcome more moderate people over then they'll feel the need to defend their leftist friends and feel more alienated by right wingers.

They might not become full socialists but it could pull them away from the right by showing them the hard the right does to the people they care about

ACAB has zero positive utility. Denoting politically vague hatred of anyone that opts into or is coerced into a specific profession directly hurts the Left and helps the Right paint us as unreasonable hateful wannabe criminals. Saying ACAB doesn't denote any measure of the nuance and pragmatism that the Left is so allergic to. We're so addicted to ""fightin' the man"" and being the uncompromising underdog freedom fighter that we make enemies where we don't have to, alienate a LOT of potential allies, play to the Right's interests, and block ourselves from infiltrating and gaining resources from existing power structures. Every seat we fill is one not occupied by a fascist and cops don't hire for quantity. Down the line, it could even **heavily** benefit our chances at dual power or surviving the next fascist uprising. (Need I remind us it was cops blocking the way on Jan 6th...)

It should be abandoned in favor of NOAL or FKC (No Officers Above the Law, or Fire/F\*ck Killer Cops)

ACAB has zero positive utility. Denoting politically vague hatred of anyone that opts into or is coerced into a specific profession directly hurts the Left and helps the Right paint us as unreasonable hateful wannabe criminals. Saying ACAB doesn't denote any measure of the nuance and pragmatism that the Left is so allergic to. We're so addicted to ""fightin' the man"" and being the uncompromising underdog freedom fighter that we make enemies where we don't have to, alienate a LOT of potential allies, play to the Right's interests, and block ourselves from infiltrating and gaining resources from existing power structures. Every seat we fill is one not occupied by a fascist and cops don't hire for quantity. Down the line, it could even **heavily** benefit our chances at dual power or surviving the next fascist uprising. (Need I remind us it was cops blocking the way on Jan 6th...)

You'd think for propaganda to be able to legitimately move so many millions of people politically it'd have to have some depth and sophistication. But in my experience the vast majority of it is ridiculously easy to refute and so obviously biased that it's not even funny. It also tends to not be very creative and really rather cookie-cutter.

Karl Marx: Hello, Joseph. It's good to see you again.

Joseph Stalin: Hello, Karl. I'm glad you could make it.

Karl Marx: So, what's on the agenda for today's debate?

Joseph Stalin: Well, I'd like to talk about the implementation of your ideas in the Soviet Union. Specifically, I'd like to defend the steps we've taken to collectivize agriculture and industrialize the country.

Karl Marx: Ah, yes. I've heard a lot about those efforts. It's certainly true that industrialization and collectivization are necessary for the development of a socialist society. But I have some concerns about the way they've been implemented in the Soviet Union.

Joseph Stalin: Such as?

Karl Marx: Well, for one thing, the forced collectivization of agriculture has led to widespread famine and suffering among the peasantry. This is not the type of progress that I had in mind when I wrote about the need for a socialist society.

Joseph Stalin: I understand your concerns, Karl. But let's not forget that we are building a new society from the ground up. This is a difficult and complicated process, and there are always going to be challenges and setbacks along the way.

Karl Marx: I agree that building a new society is difficult, but I also believe that it is important to minimize suffering and ensure that the needs of the people are met. The forced collectivization of agriculture has not done this.

Joseph Stalin: I think you're underestimating the progress we've made. The Soviet Union is now a major industrial power, and our economy is growing at a rapid pace. This would not have been possible without collectivization and industrialization.

Karl Marx: I don't deny that there have been some successes, but at what cost? The forced relocation of entire villages, the widespread famine, and the repression of dissent are not acceptable means to an end.

Joseph Stalin: I understand your concerns, Karl. But we must also consider the bigger picture. The Soviet Union is at a critical juncture in its history. We are surrounded by capitalist powers that are hostile to our cause. We must do whatever it takes to ensure the survival and success of our socialist experiment.

Karl Marx: I understand your point, Joseph. But I believe that the survival and success of socialism depends on the well-being and support of the people. If the socialist experiment is built on suffering and repression, it will not be sustainable in the long run.

Joseph Stalin: I respect your opinion, Karl. But I believe that we are on the right track. With time, I am confident that the Soviet Union will become a shining example of socialism for the rest of the world.

Hey Adam, I'm honestly pretty disappointed in your selection of Masterworks as a sponsor. As a leftist and a humanist you are well aware that the commodity form is exploitative and alienating. Art does have intrinsic value but it is not economic; it's cultural. Communal. The value of art is in it being shared and experienced by as many people as possible so we can all see how similar and wonderful and unique the world is. The value of art is in what it allows us to feel and share in other's feelings across time and cultures and languages.

Did you know that one of the largest (if not the largest) collections of fine art in the world is owned by JP Morgan Chase? And do you know what they do with literally hundreds of millions worth of art? They use it to decorate corporate office buildings and in fancy meeting rooms where they woo high-value clients. None of these artworks are viewable by the vast majority of society. Private art ownership on this scale amounts to a theft of commons. 

Group ownership of art that is then sold for a profit is only reducing the amount of people who can ever interact with the art. You want to pay to preserve and maintain art? Support your local art museum. Every country and every major city on earth has art museums that are free or very low-cost where you can see artists from every time in history and from every genre. Treating art as a commodity trade item literally destroys its artistic value as that value is only realized when the art is appreciated by humans. 

If you want art for yourself, buy a nice giclee reproduction. They are very affordable and extremely high quality now. You can buy them from museums that curate the originals and contribute to the arts' protection for society. if you want to invest in art, donate to art museums or conservatories that collect, protect, and loan originals for viewing at museums.

I will present my case by making UNDENIABLE, FACTUAL STATEMENTS about football that are not at all framed through my ideology.    

There is a ton of grooming that goes on at football stadiums, and people bring their children to NFL games all the time. This is fucking weird as we can see through every aspect of the process.      
  
GOING TO THE GAME: Kids are groomed to adopt the cult ritual of wearing a specific garb that identifies them to other members of the group, instilling a false sense of trust in each other. This makes it easier for pedophiles to get access to your children, and will put them at risk of indoctrination in the future. It also encourages them to risk their life travelling by vehicle to arrive to a stadium full of tens of thousands of strangers, at least one of which is a pedophile.         
  
IN THE STADIUM: Your child is subjected to the drug abuse, violence, and foul language of the unvetted strangers around you. If you attend a game with a school band present, your children are at risk of listening to songs that simulate sex such as ""Get Lucky"" by Daft Punk, and promote unhealthy relationships and swearing such as ""Fuck You"" By CeeLo Green. The strangers around your children may sing along or groove to these songs, which is extremely sus and makes them seem like pedophiles.    

THE CHEERLEADERS: This is obviously a pedophilic grooming habit. If it wasn't, the cheerleaders would have the sense to stop immediately when they see a child in the audience. They do dances that simulate sex by bending over, gyrating their bodies, and have men lift them up and expose their panties. All of them are in heavy makeup and costume. This grooms young girls to become cheerleaders in high school, where they do sex dances and twerking in front of audiences full of pedophiles.    

THE PLAYERS: These men run at each other full speed, ramming their bodies into one another. Head trauma is incredibly common, and players are taken off on stretchers regularly. This exposes and grooms children to the perversions of those who see violence as fun. Players and coaches also slap each other's butts on the field, which is a sex act that the child witnesses and internalizes as okay. The end effect of this is glorifying and grooming children to damage their brains, have their butts slapped by potential pedophiles, and be exposed to a possible pedophile while in the locker room during matches.      

   

As we can see by my arguments, if you don't agree with me you are kinda cringe and kinda sus, and the public will want you harmed and killed. If you defend this shit you are a part of the problem of the football groomer panic, and need to stop. You must take me seriously, please stop calling me a suspiciously concerned nerd and sound the alarm bells to everyone about this danger to our conservative movement.

I believe that white and black Americans have what I'd call a blood feud, an infernal bond. The bond that ties us together isn't ""being American"" and it sure as shit isn't ""harmony"", it's a bond of hatred, sealed in blood by the history of slavery and apartheid. I do not believe reconciliation is possible, African-Americans hate European-Americans for trying to steal our humanity and then enslaving us with racial apartheid and neoliberal capitalism after the first bloody affair had ended.

My experiences having white friends, white acquaintances, white teachers, white lovers, as well as extensively browsing 4chan has taught me that the bond of hatred can absolutely¬†never¬†be overcome. Hatred, ignorance, and fear are the most powerful things in existence, they are far stronger than love and understanding. Hatred and ignorance allow humans to embrace what exists at their rotten core, pure evil, which lies in the pit of everyone's heart.

Basically to overcome racism you would need to overcome **hatred**, but nothing is more powerful than hatred, the real world isn't like Naruto. Sometimes hatred is just passed on from father to son, forever. Like look at the Yugoslavs, they were forced, by the socialist government, to try overcoming racism for literal decades. As soon as Tito died the Serbians, Kosovons, Bosnians, Croats, and everyone else started to *massacre* each other. Anyone that thinks hatred can ever be overcome should just look at Yugoslavia, it's impossible, there is no middle ground between blacks wanting freedom and white people wanting them dead.

That said, I do want to point out an issue that many on the left seem to have and which makes it easy for right wingers to dismiss feminism as ""having gone too far"". I want the left to be strong and for that it needs to be correct, which is why I make the following criticism:

What happened to Cornbreadasserole (the person who came out with everything) was not rape. It also wasn't sexual assault (not talking about the other cases, but only about this specific one). What it was is sexual harassmant. No more, no less. It's regretable that she eventually gave consent, when she didn't really want to. I don't know what they did - she says that no penetrative sex happened - but whatever they did was too much for her. So, I cannot understand why she would *ever* agree to doing *anything.* Unless there is a *threat* of violence or other nature, you should never say *""ok, lets have sex"",* if you don't want to have sex. No matter what. Even if he asks 100 times. Just say no 100 times. That's what I would do - and the women I talked with about this agree (my partner and friends - all leftists).

Is Andrew a sexual harasser for asking 100 times? Yes. Is it extremely tedious to keep rejecting him and something she shouldn't have to do? Also yes. Is it still better than having sex with someone you don't want to have sex with? Super-yes! If the other woman, who used to date Callahan, was able to tell him to leave while he was already groping her - which is a significantly more scary situation - then so could she.

What happened to Cornbreadasserole is awful. But it was not rape. Because it was not coercion. It was pestering - which is harassment. She could've just kept saying no - or better yet don't even lead him to your place, if he's already being such a creep. Cornbreadasserole said that she for a long time thought it was her fault and sadly I have to say: Yeah it kinda is. Not in the sense that she invited this problem in any way - she shouldn't have had to deal with this behaviour in the first place! But that they eventually did end up having sex is on her.

To call this scenario coercion is to claim that women don't have agency. If you disagree with this, don't get mad and explain your reasoning. If I'm wrong, I want to know why.

66,VaushV,"I legitimately don't know if this will be an unpopular opinion or a popular one on here, but here I go.

Right-wingers often love to pose with guns, and emphasize how ""masculine"" they are in various ways. Just now some Republican randomly tweeted ""[I need a spa day followed by a mani pedi, said me never.](https://twitter.com/timburchett/status/1613136746710974465)"" And it just made me think of something.

Now, I don't really care much about ""masculinity"" as a concept anyway. But generally strength is considered a core part of traditional masculinity, no?

Well, I'd ask the following question, what takes more strength: To be an open trans man in a highly conservative state or to talk about how you love football, lift weights, have guns and don't need mani pedis all the time?

Because in my opinion it's obvious.

A guy who talks about ""Oh, I'm so masculine"" all the time is doing nothing more than cowering like a little boy. Begging the people around them to please, please value them. Please don't think I'm a girly girl, please, please, please confirm my gender identity. And they're just ""fitting in."" I think that takes no strength at all. And, in fact, when it goes against who you really are, I think it betrays a real fear and cowardice. A fear of standing up to others.

On the other hand, an open trans man living in a highly conservative state... that person is going to get a lot of pushback. Is going to get looks. Is going to be judged all the time by the people around them. That's not even mentioning the possibility of physical attack. To still say ""I'm going to be who I want to be and live my happiest life."" I think that takes a great deal of strength.

I'd say that trans man embodies the ideal of masculine ""strength"" far more than those clearly insecure conservatives who just behave as what's expected of them.

*Btw, just to be clear, my take: Masculinity as a normative concept doesn't matter. People should live the lives that make them happiest. Beyond that it doesn't matter. Nobody should force themselves to be unhappy just to live up to some idea of what others think someone of a certain sex should be like.*",Masculinity &amp; Strength,1673468233,"Masculinity &amp; Strength I legitimately don't know if this will be an unpopular opinion or a popular one on here, but here I go.

The old OGL (open gaming license) allowed independent creators to create and monetize their own D&amp;D related content, including custom campaigns, settings etc.

Now any DM who's played the game for more than a couple of years will tell you that the vibrant community that that single document created is what has made the game worth playing for so long.

And not just that, small companies, including Paizo, one of D&amp;Ds main competitors, depend on the open gaming license in order to avoid litigation from the company behind D&amp;D: Wizards of the Coast, which is owned by Hasbro.

Paizo is a great company, they're one of the first roleplaying game companies to allow their workers to unionize, and they believe in open gaming so much that they publish many of their rules for free. But they could lose all that once the old OGL dies and Hasbro decides to flex their litigation muscles.

Which brings to the death of the old OGL. There was been a leak of a new OGL (OGL 1.1) which cancels the old one and replaces it with a startling legal document that takes away many of the rights of the people who sign it. It demands 25% of their revenue above 750k and lays claim to their intellectual property. It also states that Wizards can change the document at their whim, provided they give 30 days notice. 

Noone knows if any of this will hold up in court, but it's enough for Wizards to SLAPP their competitors out of existence.

Now, Wizards has not commented on anything yet (there's been nothing but radio silence the last few days), and it IS a leak, but part of it was corroborated by one of the people at kickstarter, and it has already created so much uncertainty that many big third party creators have come out with plans to migrate.

D&amp;D may be just a game, but to some third party creators who managed to turn it into a source of revenue, it is their dream as well as their livelihood. I'd also like to say that culture is really important. The old OGL was a good way to create culture, it created a vibrant community. The new one will destroy it, and the damage may have already been done.

Thanks a million in advance!"

# Lula government detects new coup threat and triggers STF

# 

The government of President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva (PT) decided to call the Federal Supreme Court (STF) on Tuesday night (10), after detecting the threat that extremist groups are calling for new coup protests.

The ""Mega Manifesta√ß√£o Nacional pela Retomada do Poder "" is scheduled to take place in all capitals this Wednesday (11), including the Esplanada dos Minist√©rios, in Bras√≠lia, the scene of the terrorist attacks that resulted in the depredation of Congress, the Planalto Palace and the seat of the Federal Supreme Court (STF).

According to the Advocacy-General of the Union (AGU), calls for coup protests have circulated especially on Telegram.

""What is observed is a new attempt to threaten the democratic State of Law, which must be safeguarded and protected, avoiding the abuse of the right of assembly, used as an illegal and unconstitutional enclosure for true acts that attack the democratic State of Right"", warns the AGU.

And while you still should reach out...they come in knowing the deal a bit more. And people who clearly made a decesion. As oppose to a young person who brain still in that very lightly cook phase

5) When people say ""Hey no one owes you pussy"" or ""Fucked those incells who into tate"". May or may not be a shitty thing to say. But to me that not an insult to ALL MEN.

136,VaushV,"It has become the most common talking point among Tate's supporters, and even his own lawyer, to say that there is actually zero proof of any of the allegations made against the Tates. It has been widely known in Romania for a week now that this is simply not the case, since the prosecution has leaked a number of snippets from wiretapped transcripts they obtained during their investigation.

These transcripts were used, along with the victim statements, expert psychological reports of the victims and Andrew Tate's own words published to social media in public videos to convince the Judge that there is at least a reasonable suspicion that the defendants committed the crimes of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group, while the judge asked for more evidence of the rape accusation (it is notoriously difficult to prove rape, especially if said rape happened a long time ago).

One of the defence strategies Tate's lawyer used was to say that Tate was simply playing a character, or persona, in his videos so the videos shouldn't be used as evidence. However, the judge disagreed with this defence as the wiretapped transcripts obtained by prosecutors showed Tate with the same attitude and personality in private messages between himself and the victims and others.

I will layout all of the transcripts that have been leaked so far along with the sources for each transcript, they have been translated from Romanian using Google translate.

Conversation 1 (promise of marriage):

Emory (Andrew Tate): You have to understand that once you're mine, you'll be mine forever. A woman never leaves her man. I will be the last man in your life.

Emory: what do we do if we fall in love and I kidnap you to bring you to Bucharest?  
Girl: I don't think it's kidnapping, if I want to come.

Emory: first I have to see in your eyes that you will never be able to live without me. And then I can trust you to show you everything  
Girl: Bring a ring with you when you come üòä

Emory: Can you be loving enough to be a wife? To always be by my side, wherever I go? Talk to 0 men besides me? Ride or die? üòä

Emory: you have to move to Romania with me, to keep an eye on you.  
Emory: You're mine. Do not forget that. And act like it. We will be together soon.  
Girl: but can I trust you?  
Emory: Yes. You can.  
Emory: You will move to Romania with me. I plan when I get there. First, I might have to go to Prague for a few days.  
Emory: and we meet in Romania.

Emory: and I want to know that you are committed  
Emory: Serious about marriage.

**John Adams** was a respected lawyer and political activist from Massachusetts. Despite his opposition to the British Empire, he defended British soldiers against charges of murder in the aftermath of the Boston massacre. He was sent as a delegate to the First Continental Congress, where he established himself as one of the leaders of the revolution. He helped Jefferson draft the Declaration of Independence and successfully persuaded the congress to adopt it. During the Revolutionary War, he travelled Europe, securing crucial loans from the French and Dutch governments and successfully negotiated a peace treaty with Britain. In 1780, he drafted the Massachusetts Constitution which became one of the influences for United States constitution of 1787. In 1789, he became Washington's Vice President ‚Äì a largely ceremonial role which he came to detest. On tie-breaking votes, he tended to side with Alexander Hamilton's **Federalist Party**, which favoured industrialization, economic nationalism (in the form of a central bank), and strong ties with Great Britain. Adams never owned a slave and was deeply uncomfortable with the practice, but remained silent about it for fear of offending Southern allies.

**Thomas Jefferson** was a lawyer and polymath from Virginia. He was elected to the House of Burgesses in 1767 where he pushed for reforms to curb the power of the colony's slaveholding planter aristocracy ‚Äì which, hypocritically, he himself belonged to. He was sent as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress in 1775, where he was recommended by Adams to write the Declaration of Independence. After the Revolutionary War, Jefferson was successively Minister of France and Secretary of State, during which he witnessed the early stages of the French Revolution, which he controversially defended even during the infamous Reign of Terror. He opposed the Jay Treaty, signed between Washington's administration and Great Britain, and Treasury Secretary Hamilton's National Bank. He was one of the founders of the **Democratic-Republican Party**, which, in contrast to the centralized industrial capitalist Atlantic-facing vision of the Federalists, favoured an agrarian westward-facing nation with a limited government. Despite opposing slavery to varying degrees throughout his career, Jefferson owned over 100 human beings at the time of the 1796 election.

**Issues**

\- Recently the French Revolution has turned violent. **Adams** and the **Federalists** condemn the violence, and view a restoration of the French monarchy as the lesser of two evils. **Jefferson** and the **Democratic-Republicans** believe that any endorsement of monarchy is unthinkable and that France's project, though flawed, is ultimately for the best.

\- The Jay Treaty established peace between Great Britain and the United States. **Adams** and the **Federalists** support making peace with America's former enemy. **Jefferson** does not.

\- Washington's Treasury Secretary Hamilton established the First National Bank to manage the finances and debts of the fledgling nation. **Adams** supports this, while **Jefferson** fears that a central bank will increase the debt, create monopolies and neglect the needs yeomen.

I'm 14 and I used to be a huge Vaush fan. He's shown me so much (even as father may now hate me). But after watching Noah's video. And then the Flowers debate again... and then Vaush's response to Noah's video.

I'm not sure he's a sincere actor. No one was arguing for mass genocide. Flowers was very clear and detailed in explaining that wasn't what she supported.

Why does - wanting separatist spaces in South Africa=keeping colonial borders and doing mass genocide? That's such an insane leap of logic. There's so much ethnic diversity if South Africa that's been ignored to push this idea of a mythic black ethnostate that then genocides whites... it seems like, against everything sane Flowers is saying with detail, he's pushing a hyper emotive strawman (you support genocide!), which of course leads to a more emotive and less rational debate as a result. Being hyper emotive with dishonest framing. How does that improve the quality of debate? Its up there with 'the nazis were national socialists, you say your a socialist, therefore your a nazi!'

And it seems like he's repeating the right wing ""REVERSE RACISM"" thing that was pretty well dispelled around 2012. Yes the cognitive process that underpins racism, the failure of categorisation that underpins racism happens across races. But that doesn't discount the social context in which racism takes place.

186,VaushV,"Apologies for another discourse post but I thought it was interesting to consider the concept of coerced consent and it's implications.

A lot of this is just personal experience so take it with a grain of salt and share your disagreements if you've got one.

A large part of flirting and/or hook ups involves a game we play of ""who wants who more"". People often play upon eachother's insecurities, joke, and feign non-attraction as part of the experience. Occasionally two people will get lucky and have a great experience of total understanding and mutual attraction and enthusiasm, but this is far less often the case than a wishy washy sort of ""I guess she's cute enough"" or ""I'd rather not deal with turning him down"" sort of thought process. At this point, where can we draw a line between coercion and consent? Of course the truest answer is only unimpaired enthusiastic consent is consent but I think it's very normal (or at least normalized) to have sex without both parties being equally enthused. In the main video of the girl coming out about Andrew coercing her, she states directly that she gave verbal consent, but that she didn't want to. We all agree this is SA to an extent, but how could he ever be charged with anything from that statement? She agreed to it verbally, so I doubt any court of law could convict him, even if they had video evidence of the event.

(I know there were some accusations of stuff that was pretty much rape from other people but I'm just talking about the coerced consent stuff here)

I think a lot of our thoughts on this betray a much larger issue with our culture around sex. We all know that he did some scumbag shit, but none of it is explicitly wrong, in the sense that he ""checked all the boxes"". Girl he knew personally, she was comfortable around him and trusted him, check. They got into bed together and she was ok with it, check. He asked her if she wanted to have sex and she said yes, check. In a different context this would be a totally normal and cool sexual experience, but because AC was only checking boxes and not actually treating her like a human being he completely disregarded her actual human experience, and so would a court, or any judge. The biggest issue is how do we judge at what point coercive action becomes offense. People coerce other people all the time in little ways, I get my shy friends to go to the bar with me by buying them drinks, girls try to get me to buy them drinks by chatting me up. At what point does it become bad? Is it like pornography and we just have to know it when we see it? There's a very fine line between acknowledging someone is a serial sexual manipulator, and accusing them of a sex crime. Some people might think there is no difference. In that respect I think it's important to acknowledge neurodivergence, and the sense that some people find it much more difficult to discern social cues. If someone is incapable of or has difficulty reading body language and tone of voice, how are they supposed to know if someone assents to sex begrudgingly or enthusiastically? Beyond even that, neurotypical people misinterpret these cues constantly.

I think the main problem with our culture around sex is that the most romanticized encounters are the ones with the least verbal communication. The idea of someone understanding you and knowing exactly what you want and how you want it without saying anything directly is the sexiest version of a hookup that people talk about, and that leads to a lot of people trying to emulate that 'sexiness' by beating around the bush until someone ends up unwillingly involved.

I think people have been doing really good work for a little while now in trying to normalize enthusiastic verbal consent,  but cases like this are indicative that we haven't gone nearly far enough in making people understand that not only is enthusiastic verbal consent good but all other types of ""consent"" are not good enough and shouldn't be accepted.

Somebody much smarter than me probably thought all this and debunked some of it years ago, this whole thing just made me think a little.

The responses I got, to what I felt was a fairly clear breakdown were often unhinged. Some mocked us. Some agreed. Some rightly pointed out where I was hypocritical, unfairly generalising, or didn't use the most strategic tone (fine). But no one that disagreed wanted to engage with the logic of the debate.

One particularly unhinged customer went off at something I didn't say, doubled down, refused to engage with anything I was saying, then called me a nazi (lol)?

I thought yous were meant to be debate bros? Is the idea to have Vaush do all the debating, are none of the sycophants capable of their own thought? Maybe those that are, agreed. Anyways. I thought we could have some fun. I might come off as a dick, but I sincerely am open to walking back things, changing my mind if given good reasonings. I'm very much about putting the ego aside. The goal is good politics that betters things, right? Not pumping up ego or group identity. Maybe that's an alien concept here. Perhaps the debate bro style of thinking is more about dishonest uses of rhetoric, than a more philosophically grounded engaging with the logic of the thing. That's kinda the best explanation I've seen for how Vaush repeatedly says dumb shit off the cuff, doubles down even after a gazzil people patiently explain why he's wrong, with a personality cult at the disposal to sooth any worries (and abuse whoevs he got hysterical with).

Being unreflexive to criticism doesn't make good politics but. Its isn valuable to to the actual political goals, and I think its a large part of why the broader left finds Vaush so irrelevant to whatevers being done.

The responses I got, to what I felt was a fairly clear breakdown were often unhinged. Some mocked us. Some agreed. Some rightly pointed out where I was hypocritical, unfairly generalising, or didn't use the most strategic tone (fine). But no one that disagreed wanted to engage with the logic of the debate.

One particularly unhinged customer went off at something I didn't say, doubled down, refused to engage with anything I was saying, then called me a nazi (lol)?

I thought yous were meant to be debate bros? Is the idea to have Vaush do all the debating, are none of the sycophants capable of their own thought? Maybe those that are, agreed. Anyways. I thought we could have some fun. I might come off as a dick, but I sincerely am open to walking back things, changing my mind if given good reasonings. I'm very much about putting the ego aside.

The winning strategy is to never stop advancing. This requires the discipline of keeping your opponent on one point and refusing their retreat or diversion- make them own what they said by demanding they provide one or multiple examples of their claim which you can meet with historic counter-evidence - this becomes exceptionally impacting when their defense begins to bare contradictions in their previous points, as internalizing that one's color determines their main character status would result.

4 days ago TikTok user u/cornbreadasserole posted a video TikTok accusing Andrew of sexual coercion/sexual assault in March of 2021. Apparently she let him sleep over because she got a story from Andrew that he was kicked out of his place. She made it clear that she didn't want anything sexual to happen but apparently Andrew would not take no for an answer and repeatedly wore her down until she finally said yes. She also said the she tried to come out before but Andrew texted her and said it would ruin his life if she did come out. I think she also mentions at some point he was drunk, but also that he was trying to make her over drink. In a later TikTok as her evidence she has been with Andrew she posts a pic of the two together, and posts DMs from probably about 10 ppl that have other various accusations that anonymously felt comfortable to come out to her.

A couple days later another woman u/moldyfreckle posted her video on TikTok. Her story was that in around 2019/18 she had sex with Andrew but he gave off really bad vibes. When andrew messaged her again to hangout she refused, but Andrew said he wanted to apologize so she accepted a date. On the date he proceeds to barely apologize and harass her for sex in her car. When she refuses, he then asks for a drive home. She accepts, but once in the car he sexually harasses her, even putting his hand down her shorts without consent, and refuses to leave when she asks him to.

After these two stories, older allegations resurfaced that were never taken seriously / never gained traction from 2021 and 2020.

The 2021 one was an instagram story from an account that said her friend was sexually harassed by Andrew. The account also includes an anonymous DM she got from a different woman that says that he has done this at least 3 other times to mostly underage girls. The girl that had originally posted the allegation in 2021 resurfaced on this subreddit and basically said that her friend called her in the morning, started bawling her eyes out and said Andrew assaulted her. She confirmed it was her by showing insta pics that matched the original account that posted the allegations on insta

The 2020 allegations were also an instagram story- they basically said that Andrew had attempted to prey on one of this girl's friends when she was extremally drunk. Despite her inebriation this women's friend still had the state of mind to say no, but he kept pestering her for sex. After posting these, the person got an anonymous DM saying that Andrew raped one of her friends and aggressively pursued the anonymous woman when she was 17.

Other then that, various other small stories have popped up, all anonymous accounts, etc. A bunch on this subreddit and a bunch on u/cornbreadasserole's comment section. A lot claiming Andrew has harassed them or friends they knew. Some claiming andrew's ""tendencies"" were basically an open secret in the New Orleans graffiti scene. One anonymous story claimed they used to hang out with Andrew and though they never saw Andrew actually assault anyone he used to get outrageously inebriated/high and have really weird afterparties after his shows, which he felt was a recipe for bad things to happen. Though, one of the allegations on the subreddit from an anonymous user did turn out to be a fake troll.

There was also a post on the subreddit from an anonymous woman who said she had a somewhat positive sexual history with Andrew. though she didn't have any overtly negative experiences with him, did say he can be a coercive at times and ""selectively empathic"". She said that her positive experiences shouldn't necessarily negate the others stories.",Summary of all the Channel 5 Andrew Callaghan allegations:,1673311242,"Summary of all the Channel 5 Andrew Callaghan allegations: Please comment if there's something to add/correct.

228,VaushV,"Greetings, and sorry for my English.

The conversation I‚Äôve had was about whether or not voting allowed for direct action or the other way around.

Direct action here  means directly reach for certain goals of interest, in contrast to those actions that appeal to others (e.g. authorities), by, for example, revealing an existing problem, highlighting an alternative, or demonstrating a possible solution.

Think occupation of factories, General strikes, etc.

I personally believe that direct action allowed voting like for universal suffrage to become a thing.

First by fighting against Property Qualifications (I.e. only property owners get to vote.) and eventually for women and other minorities.

246,VaushV,"Hey all, Ottawa-Canadian here who had to deal with our own little fascist uprising. Been seeing some comparisons between the Convoy occupation and Jan 06 and the recent Jan 08 event in Brazil. Some people were saying the Convoy wasn't as serious as Jan 06/08 and wanted to give my perspective as someone who sat through it and obsessively followed discussion around the events.

**Why the Convoy was a threat just as serious as Jan 06/08**

From the beginning, Convoyers made their stated goals clear - the Canada Unity group which was a major organizer for the event called for our elective parliament to be dissolved and their own spokespeople given authoritarian powers over provinces/territories/municipalities to unilaterally make decisions about COVID-19 policies and general public health. Many of the main organizers had associations with extremist groups or hold extremist, bigoted beliefs about immigrants, LGBTQ people, Indigenous people, etc. Some called Trudeau a dictator and either implicitly or explicitly called for him and other government officials to be executed.

When the Convoy began, plenty of people from white nationalist/extremist groups were present. Lots of people calling for a revolution. White nationalist/militia/other hate flags were flying. Foreign fascist media such as RT and Fox were positively covering the protest, and foreign donations were coming into Convoyer pockets either through traditional crowd-funding or cryptocurrencies. The messaging and ideas behind the Convoy were clear - this is an anti-democratic movement.

**Different strategies from a direct coup**

Although a direct coup attempt/storming of government building didn't happen, I think that it was possible - there were certainly some individuals trying to call for and instigate it. But maybe moreso, the strategy was planned differently - this was meant to be a prolonged seige/occupation.

The dedicated protesters were coming here for the long-run. Many associated with the dedicated/organizing contingents were ex-military and applying military strategy to their organizing. They were bringing large amounts of supplies into the downtown core to set up permanent encampments. At one point they were building shacks downtown, but were moved because they were dumbasses and nearly burnt it down from open fires near haybales - they later established two control points, one in town  that was a re-supply hub located next to a major roadway, and a second more secretive intel/planning HQ in rural Ottawa on private property. They had food and fuel distribution lines coordinated in the main downtiwn encampment, and had organized contingency plans and strategies for when these supply lines were disrupted.

These people were given the time and ability to begin establishing long-term encampment. Local police were largely hands-off and gentle with them, many either worried about provoking violence or who were sympathetic to their occupation. Police operations were regularly getting leaked to Convoyers who could then respond strategically to enforcement. When restrictions came into place such as no horns or gas cans, Convoyers started coordinating their horn campaigns and tying gas cans to kids/carrying dummy cans to overwhelm any cops trying to enforce the rules. Tow truck companies were either supportive of the messaging and refused to act, or were threatened by Convoyers with violence. Downtown citizens were regularly harassed and intimidated. Businesses and organizations were threatened and damaged if not supportive of the Convoy. Meanwhile, the Conservative Premier of the province was slow to act for his own political agendas against the Federal government, and Canadian Conservative politicians promoted the Convoy and tried to downplay their danger.

**Why the Convoy failed**

The Convoy was eventually stopped due to the Emergencies Act being invoked. The situation, while on paper could have been stopped at the municipal level, was not likely to have been. A mixture of incompetence, conflicting jurisdictional authority, implicit endorsement by Conservative politicians trying to use the chaos for their own agendas as well as explicit endorsement by extremists wanting Convoyers to be successful all necessitated the Energencies Act and the powers it had.

There were some other factors however that played a role in preventing further escalation and had an impact on how things played out.

One was culture. Although Canada does have extremists and exports a lot of extremist ideology, Canada is a lot more progressive than the USA or Brazil. Our people are less likely to act on extremist behaviour and try something like a coup. The Convoy dramatically inflated their numbers to make it seem like they were representing the majority, but that simply wasn't true. A lot of people did go to the occupation simply to party/let out their pent up anger over extended lockdowns.

Another factor was geography. A lot of our right-wing extremism comes from Alberta. Canada is big as fuck. This necessitated several days of driving through Canadian winter to reach the protest site. These are significant costs, and a lot of people couldn't afford that amount of time/money, especially after infighting and money not being properly distributed (more on that). Ottawa is a really Liberal city, and past the initial occupation, occupiers had to rely on out-of-towners making weekend trips to the encampments to sustain their physical presence. That was one of the reason protests began at borders - it was easier logistics than making everyone go to Ottawa.

On the topic of those border blockades - this was when for a lot of Canadians the fanaticism of the Convoyers was really shown and their overall support plummetted. They were causing billions of dollars in lost trade, and planned to kill Mounties (stereotypical police symbol of Canada, culturally loved by a lot). That economic pressure across Canada particularly impacted Conservative politicians and made them more receptive to stopping the occupation.

Communication and infighting were also a problem. Convoyers ranged from people mad at COVID restrictions to people wanting fascism. COVID restrictions were already in the process of being lifted and some did lift during the occupation, so some took that as a win and went home. Increasingly, the occupiers were only the fascists/people who wanted to harass marginalized locals for the sake of being bigots. Different Convoy leaders were speaking for different factions and groups of people. Everyone was calling eachother feds. The people receiving donations meant to sustain the Convoy were hoarding or mis-appropriating money. Crypto scams were popping up. People got too focused on the grift as opposed to taking down the government.

**Tl;Dr**

The Convoy was just as bad as Jan 06 or Jan 08, and had the same goals - to overthrow a democratically elected government and to further erode democracy. The Convoy had a seige strategy that they used for this goal as opposed to a direct immediate attack, however due to a combination of factors their plan did not take off.

**The future**

Canada is largely impacted by American culture, and I expect any erosion of democracy here to be predicated on erosion of democracy in the US. Whether the Canadian government is covertly strategizing for this or if they will remain oblivious remains to be seen. The right-wing in Canada is resolute on following the path of American identity politics, and I have no doubt that those in high positions of power in Canada are not totally oblivious to that and their actions fuelled by political strategizing about how to engage with anti-democratic elements over incompetence regarding those elements. I do think however that the threat of fascism and the decline of capitalism and the environment as a result are being underestimated, and that it is incredibly unsafe to play coy about the threat and hope that not engaging it directly and aggressively will make it peter out.

It is also tough for me to gauge just how organized the fascists were. This is more of a broader international cultural thing about how a lot of fascist groups currently operate independently and have very loose and obscure communication channels. But I have no doubt that those who are seriously dedicated to overt fascism and government coups took lessons from how Canada's convoy played out in regards to organizing and communicating.",Comparing the Canadian Convoy to Jan 06/Jan 08,1673284185,"Comparing the Canadian Convoy to Jan 06/Jan 08 Hey all, Ottawa-Canadian here who had to deal with our own little fascist uprising.

249,VaushV,"Texts and other forms of writing are physical evidence. Both allegations made by alleged victims make references to text messages that Andrew should (unless he got his phone purged) have access to. 

&amp;#x200B;

**In Allegation #1:**

Andrew allegedly texted begging the person not to tell people about what happened and said her talking about it is ruining his life. The alleged victim has shown that she has access to these text messages but haven't posted them, choosing instead to post some anonymous tik tok comments instead. 

**In Allegation #2:**

Andrew asked to take the alleged victim to dinner because she was offended by the way he treated her previously. The alleged victim doesn't have access to these text messages. She also makes references to Instagram messages that she can't access because she is blocked by him.

&amp;#x200B;

Andrew Callaghan should have access to both sets of texts and he should post them post them if he has them. He doesn't ""owe"" it to us but the public doesn't ""owe"" good graces to anyone. At this point The Truth is the only defense he can take, whether or not it paints him in a good light or a bad one.

&amp;#x200B;

**In the case of #1:**

Texts will prove or disproves the allegation, in the eyes of the public, based on whether or not Andrew begged her not to tell anyone. The fact that she showed she has access to the texts and chose not to post the pertinent one is a little sus... but could be stupidity rather than maliciousness. Being ignorant on the topic of making allegation videos doesn't mean you haven't been a victim of SA. Lying about texts more than a year after your previous set of allegations in an edited video that you (presumably by the nature of editing) watched before posting is a pretty good indicator of malicious intent. 

&amp;#x200B;

**In the case of #2:**

It isn't provable through texts. If the texts were as she describes then the situation in the car is really he said she said. If they were not as she described its sorta understandable because she hasn't had access to these texts for more than (in her words) 3 years so its understandable that she might misremember. If the texts are so clearly not what she described then each person will have to make a judgement based on how far off the mark she was. At the very least he should post their instagram messages since (presumably) he is the one who blocked her... it would be really weird if she is the one who blocked him and was using that block to explain why she couldn't get the messages so I assume it to be he blocked her.  

&amp;#x200B;

I made this because I kept seeing people say / type ""He said / She said"" as though both of these allegations aren't making clear references to physical evidence that can be dug up. Phone records are stored for at least 5 years by AT&amp;T so, especially in the case of #1, this is not solely ""He said / She said"".","Andrew Callaghan Drama is not ""He Said / She Said"" there is at least one set of physical evidence:",1673278553,"Andrew Callaghan Drama is not ""He Said / She Said"" there is at least one set of physical evidence: Texts and other forms of writing are physical evidence. Both allegations made by alleged victims make references to text messages that Andrew should (unless he got his phone purged) have access to. 

&amp;#x200B;

**In Allegation #1:**

Andrew allegedly texted begging the person not to tell people about what happened and said her talking about it is ruining his life. The alleged victim has shown that she has access to these text messages but haven't posted them, choosing instead to post some anonymous tik tok comments instead. 

**In Allegation #2:**

Andrew asked to take the alleged victim to dinner because she was offended by the way he treated her previously. The alleged victim doesn't have access to these text messages. She also makes references to Instagram messages that she can't access because she is blocked by him.

&amp;#x200B;

Andrew Callaghan should have access to both sets of texts and he should post them post them if he has them. He doesn't ""owe"" it to us but the public doesn't ""owe"" good graces to anyone. At this point The Truth is the only defense he can take, whether or not it paints him in a good light or a bad one.

&amp;#x200B;

**In the case of #1:**

Texts will prove or disproves the allegation, in the eyes of the public, based on whether or not Andrew begged her not to tell anyone. The fact that she showed she has access to the texts and chose not to post the pertinent one is a little sus... but could be stupidity rather than maliciousness. Being ignorant on the topic of making allegation videos doesn't mean you haven't been a victim of SA. Lying about texts more than a year after your previous set of allegations in an edited video that you (presumably by the nature of editing) watched before posting is a pretty good indicator of malicious intent.

Here is what we currently know pertaining to the allegations of Andrew Callaghan. Trigger warning for discussions of assault.

1. There has been social media claims by supposed people that know him from the Seattle area that say Andrew is a creep.
2. There have been social media claims that say Andrew is known in circles in the St. Petersburg, FL, area for being a creep.
3. There have been two TikTok accounts that have posted videos by people bringing forth personal allegations of harm Andrew has done to them.
4. Both accounts are currently private as of the time of this post.
5. The first gave a story and provided support that they knew Andrew somewhat and they met sometime through the sharing of personal DMs and a picture together. The second gave a story but did not provide any support to back up their story.
6. The first story claims that they met Andrew at a bar in St. Petersburg, FL, they were bought loads of drinks, they both got drunk, Andrew stayed at their place, Andrew then pressed the sex issue repeatedly, the accuser eventually relented (not exactly consent) and let Andrew do sexual acts with them.
7. The second story claims that Andrew met them at a restaurant, Andrew tried to persuade them into sexual acts, they said no, they agreed to drive Andrew home, Andrew then forced himself on them in the car.
8. Andrew has not provided a comment at all.

Because of this information, this is what the stance should be:

Maybe both of these happened, maybe Andrew is a creep, nobody knows until we get further information or a response from Andrew.

I‚Äôve voiced my displeasure as to how the accusations have come out (they‚Äôve provided little support for their stories, they‚Äôve resorted to personal attacks on people who‚Äôve asked for support to their stories, their intentions are unclear as to whether they want accountability or for Andrew to lose his platform, these claims have been given no time frame or they happened 3 years ago which brings into question why they waited 3 years, they‚Äôve claimed that ‚Äúyou should believe me because other people are saying things‚Äù, etc) and I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of how much this type of shit happens to Vaush (claims of misogny, transphobia, the pedo accusations, etc) and we can clearly due some quick critical thinking and realize‚Ä¶ this seems spurious or shallow.

I find I have slowly overtime come to value way too much things like... \*sigh\* virginity and that kinda shit. Like, this has nothing to do with how good it would be to date or even have sex with someone etc. right but I still internally value it? Like I fear with this sort of road when these sorts of things are more valuable then who or how attractive the person is like a random 17 year old whos a virgin rather than someone my age who is cool and shit who isn't that's a scary prospect right? Like I'm not a conservative who morally values things like virginity and shit - logically I am sex positive but my aversions and feelings lead me elsewhere.  
How do I break down these ideas and get back to actually being excited about the person themselves? Like ofcourse this doesn't make me happy. Like I feel like these beliefs don't come from me but like society and the media, porn and discussions or whatever that I consume that fetisise this stuff - like many of you I could probably write essays on this stuff and I'm the same and I can deconstruct blackpill arguments all day but they still draw a gut feeling from me which isn't just a faint curiosity but actually effects what I value in something as gut based as this.

I will preface this by saying that I'm of the belief that a boycott of Hogwarts Legacy is pointless and in many cases genuine virtue signalling, especially in the terms that Gamingcirclejerk and other online communities would present it. This is not to say that people should buy the game, of course, seeing as individuals boycotting something for any reason is completely fine. It's when demands are made of others to boycott a thing that I take issue, especially when absolute statements such as 'anyone who does \[thing\] is a \[bad thing\]' are brought into play. It's not a position that can stand up to any sort of scrutiny without revealing the inherent hypocrisy of those saying it and the various forms of unethical consumption they themselves engage in. Purchasing a game doesn't make you a transphobe in the same way that watching Marvel or purchasing Amazon Prime doesn't mean you support their treatment of workers.

I will also share Vaush's own opinions on boycotting:

&gt;The liberal consumerist obsession with boycotting as a means of expressing moral virtue is really fucking tiring

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\[in reference to purchasing games from a developer owned by the Saudi Royal family\]   
&gt;  
&gt;I think it's it's totally okay to do that, the weird thing to me is when people start getting really demanding about others doing it because we're always right on one thing and wrong on like 599 when it comes to this. I don't know how well anyone can live like that on like an applicable scale. It's good to do what you can but at the end of the day the most you could do wouldn't be boycotting it would be probably supporting politicians that would react to the kind of behaviors that you would take issue with.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There is nothing wrong with consuming media made by people who are problematic, anyone who tells you otherwise is a liberal. The idea of boycotting as some kind of final blow against bad people is stupid.

Gamingcirclejerk has in recent weeks and months been a key part of an online movement for the boycotting of Hogwarts Legacy, protesting JK Rowling's horrible transphobia and a (possibly misinformed) belief that there will be anti-progressive messaging in the game.

They're also making the claim that *anyone* who purchases the game is transphobic. It doesn't matter if you're trans yourself, have been a staunch ally of LGBTQ people and causes, or if you're just some guy, you are a transphobe if you purchase this game.

This is dumb.

All these people want is to feel morally good about themselves and superior to others. The extreme moral framing of this issue in particular only adds to how good they feel about themselves: 'I didn't buy a game therefore I'm morally good, they did buy a game and therefore they're evil. I'm better than them.' Not to mention all of the people who are claiming to boycott the game yet would never have bought the game in the first place even if the cirumstances around Rowling were different (these are the virtue signallers).

These same people aren't abiding by their own standards either. They'll purchase games by scummy companies (which is most of them) who engage in predatory MTX and who force their developers to crunch. No one's calling these people out for being anti-worker or anti-anti-consumer, because, obviously, they're not.

The boycott also isn't working. At all.

The game, which isn't out for another month, is currently the top selling game on Steam, Epic, Amazon, and other online stores, and has a strong chance of being the top selling game of the year, beating out Zelda and Starfield, amongst others.

In the meantime, Gamingcirclejerk are currently -- true to name -- jerking themselves off over getting unpleasant tags to appear on the Steam page for the game. This is more virtue signalling. Presumably many of them will purchase the game to review-bomb it, and then refund their purchase. Also unhelpful.

There's a fantastic opportunity here to spread awareness of trans issues. This isn't done by calling everyone transphobic.

I've maintained in comments of this sub before that the most effective thing to do in regards to Hogwarts Legacy is to encourage those who want to buy the game (which will likely be in the tens of millions) to supplement a purchase with a donation to a trans charity (as things stand, I myself will be buying the game on PS5 and matching the cost with a donation to Mermaids UK), encourage streamers and YouTubers who play the game to fundraise for charity alongside it, and to ensure that people know what Rowling believes and why it's bad (you may be surprised at how many people are completely unaware since the drama is mostly concentrated in online spaces). Let people, supplied with full information on the situation, come to their own decision in regards to whether they can personally justify getting the game. 

Accusing people of being transphobic when they are not is far less helpful for trans people than saying 'Hey, did you know all these things about Rowling? Still want to buy the game? Try pirating it or getting it second-hand, and if you can't or really don't want to wait, how about donating to a trans charity to supplement your purchase either way?'

Jessie Gender, a trans woman, wrote an [article](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/) early last year about Hogwarts Legacy. I'll share the final words of the article:

&gt;You're not a bad person if you want to play Hogwarts  Legacy. Many trans people themselves are planning to buy the game  despite their justified anger towards Rowling. Yet, the important thing  is not to condemn the game or renounce your love of Harry Potter; it's  to wrestle with the complexity of it and decide for yourself. Trans  people don't get to ignore the pain the franchise has become  intrinsically linked to, and those who wish to care for them shouldn't  get to do so, either. Many will ignore this article and others like it  in order to turn a blind eye to the harm done or seek absolution for  their choice in buying the game. Some will even (and already have)  proudly proclaim their forth-coming purchase in order to express their  disdain for having to think about trans people at all. You don't get to  defend Rowling or Harry Potter and not understand what that actually  means to a trans person, or the ramification it has for all of us, not  just trans people.  
&gt;  
&gt;So supporting Hogwarts Legacy, a game  about fighting magical fantasy bigots, isn't wrong, but ignoring its legacy within actual bigotry would be.

And, finally, with no notes, I'll share these two images on the efficacy of boycotting:

When I've got a coworker making transphobic jokes and your boss is laughing along with them, what can you do? You can't really outright debate them or show your power level, and morally you also can't just let it go without saying...*something*, so what do you all do? I'm kind of dealing with this right now. I can't afford to lose this job and even if I quit and found another, the same thing would happen there. It's happened everywhere I've worked because I live in deep red country.

‚Äì From The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) by Hannah Arendt

Hannah Arendt's philosophy can help us understand how far-Right ideology causes &amp; reinforces the experience of an organized loneliness in young men &amp; other demographics. If Arendt's analysis is even close to adequate, then our society &amp; democracy are in serious trouble, as we're dealing with a portion of our population that no longer lives or thinks in accordance with a concrete world of lived experience. 

Arendt highlights these key components of ideology:

1) It relies upon  logical procedures divorced from the reality of the lived world.

2) It insists upon a ""deeper"" reality operating behind what is normally perceived.

Essentially, Arendt argues that ideology results in organized loneliness, leading to tyrannical thought. This requires some unpacking.

Totalitarian tendencies appeal to the personal loneliness of those who are not satisfied with reality and/or are unwilling to come face-to-face with the world as it is.

Taking advantage of the above susceptibilities, ideology starts by ruining our relationships with others &amp; and ourselves through increased cynicism &amp; skepticism until we:

1) No longer trust our own judgment. Forcing us to rely on the ideology alone, which will reveal the so-called ""truth"". 

2) No longer can distinguish fact from fiction &amp; the true from the false. The boundaries are blurred/erased. (Alternative facts.)

Because of the above, contact with others in a shared reality of actual lived experiences is lost. It is replaced by the projection of secret, hidden meanings into all events &amp; experiences. In other words, we are turned away, or isolated, from the present, concrete world to the ""world"" ideology constructs. 

At this point, we arrive at the relationship between ideology &amp; tyrannical thought. 

Once ideology takes hold, experience and reality, both absent, no longer bear upon our thinking. Rather, experiences now conform to the ""logic"" of the ideology, regardless of the irrationality that ensues. This is preparation for the acceptance of tyrannical thinking, wherein our thoughts are no longer our own. We surrender our ability &amp; freedom to think for ourselves to those ""thoughts"" preordained by ideology. 

Lastly, we will refuse to think &amp; reject thinking in general, for both can undermine the fragile ideological beliefs that have given us a feeling of place &amp; purpose. We're trapped in an organized loneliness, a negative solidarity, whose only commond ground are anger &amp; resentment toward the present order. 

It is difficult not to look out into the world &amp; see  this exact phenomenon occurring. ""Facts"" don't care about your feelings, or thoughts for that matter, if they are nothing but ideology through &amp; through.

355,VaushV,"Greetings, and sorry for my English.

I‚Äôm writing this after being told by a fellow traveler here that the mods at Vaush‚Äôs Discord channel are apparently untrustworthy.

I originally went to discord after being told once that debates over there were more constructive, more in good faith.

I was wrong.

I went to #glorious-contentions-1 to chat about something Malatesta said in the 1880s, and while it started well, eventually the debates stopped being serious and eventually whatever good faith there was melted away.

There where character assassinations, accusations of moving goalposts, when all I asked was for them to clarify their original points, and mockeries.

It was like trying to debate a crowd.

After talking about my experience here, I eventually told one of the posters that I tried talking to the mods but had yet to receive a reply.

That‚Äôs when they told me, about the controversy.

As I said, apparently the mods over there are untrustworthy, even by Vaush.

Supposedly the controversy started when some mods decided to moderate chatters in a way that others found too softly, also I was told that they where discovered in a different channel insulting Vaush.

Look, nobody likes a bootlicker, but insults are a different thing altogether.

Supposedly even Vaush has said to not go to that discord.

Now here‚Äôs my problem, it‚Äôs basically hearsay.

What I ask if anyone willing to post here is this: 

Can anyone help me find some evidence for what I just said?

I‚Äôm not interested in anything over there except the possibility that the debates over there better, if that isn‚Äôt even true, I‚Äôm leaving the discord channel and I‚Äôll stick to Reddit.

I‚Äôm not interested in new stream warnings, I‚Äôm a more-or-less former Vaushite who still looks at their Twitter from time to time and chats here at r/VaushV.

Me and two friends were talking the other day - one was slightly drunk and we where sober and he talked about a fantasy of his of a roleplay where a girl is dressed as a nun (probably sexy costume version) and through ‚Äòlust‚Äô has sex with him. 

We kinda found it funny but soon we engaged in a discussion around why nuns are fetishised - the spanking, the holiness, the ‚Äòpurity‚Äô of a nun. 

This then led us to talking about other female religious attire. This led us to talk about the hijab and burqa (or burka, please correct me if possible) and debated whether they are as fetishised as nuns clothing. And as per the discussion why don‚Äôt people wear them in roleplay. 

My perspective was that it could come across as rather weird, bordering on culturally insensitive to which drunk friend said ‚Äòwhy isn‚Äôt the nun culturally insensitive‚Äô, drunk friend said he wouldn‚Äôt be against trying it out but it is obviously weirder and harder to convince a girl to try it then a nun roleplay

My other friend said it‚Äôs bordering on raceplay levels of fetishisation and could not be compared to nuns robes, that the scenario would likely be mockery of Islam and insult the woman in the roleplay as some western dominance thing.

382,VaushV,"Discovery released a show back in June of 2013 called [Mountain Monsters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR2Pa5hfw9c&amp;ab_channel=LegitEliminator). This show came alongside a host of other ""Cryptid"" and ""Ghost Hunting"" on Discovery and has outlasted each and every one of them. It will be receiving its 9th season in 2023 and I heavily suggest everyone who is able watches it. 

Cryptids are monsters such as Big Foot, Loch Ness, Moth Man, and other creatures that are reported to exist but have no real evidence backing their existence. Cryptids and Ghost Hunting shows are not very well respected in any circles besides their own. They are misinformation as they prey on people's religious beliefs, lack of media literacy, and mistrust of scientific communities to peddle products. These circles tend to be very toxic, very conservative, and it is so hard to detangle the harmful misinformation from the harmless that its easier to just throw the whole thing away. It was in this culture that the show Mountain Monsters arrived and created a counter culture that, along with its budget of 8 KFC buckets and a 50$ Amazon Gift card for all involved, has lead to its long lifespan and relative success. 

The show follows a small group of Hillbilly Cryptid hunters known as The Appalachian Investigators of Mysterious Sightings or A.I.M.S. Each episode follows a simple formula:

The crew discus a creature and are aided with shitty NatGeo 3d renderings during their description.  
They talk about the creature's last sighting and head there, often taking time to pay respect to the community the monster stalks. Their aim is to capture and release the monster as to not allow it to harm or be harmed by humans. They head out and are beaten by the monster (sometimes they are physically attacked, other times just evaded). Regrouping, they create a trap and a plan then head out for round 2 only to be beaten again but just barely. Often times the team is upset by the monster's tactics and launch complaints much like you would during a fighting game match, 'Moth Man's a coward. Son of a bitch would have been ours if he'd just stop teleporting over the damned place'. 

Over time the AIMS crew has character development and we are introduced to an evil offshoot who's looking to kill monsters rather than capture them and things get stranger from there. Basically, its one big LARP. The creatures are often just off camera or are covered in darkness so you can barely see them. The crew are kidnapped and their kidnappers just let the camera crew do as they please. The show isn't trying to convince anyone its real, but it is shot in a way that pays respects to the other Cryptid and Ghost Hunting shows in its genre sans the negative aspects. This is a show for people who love Cryptids and Ghost Hunting but aren't Alex Jones fans. All the parts of the show that gets people sucked into that negative aspect of Cryptids and Ghost Hunting but with wholesomeness at the end of its journey rather than a pipeline to far-right politics... do you get it? This show is to Cryptids and Ghost Hunting what Positive Masculinity should be to Masculinity. 

When you don't understand Masculinity nor its appeal, as I'm sure most of you don't understand Cryptid Shows or their appeal, its easy to see a [group of 5 out of shape white dudes walking around in the forest with guns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=118-FfG6ZAs&amp;ab_channel=DestinationAmerica) and just throw it away as something bad but if you give it a close look... more than just a tweet worth of attention you come to realize just because you don't get it doesn't mean its bad. 

This show has had public feuds with other Cryptid shows that try to paint them as lesser. This show follows all of the conventions laid out by the OG Ghost Hunting and Cryptid shows and, when compared to other shows in the genre, can be hard to differentiate. Really the show is the same as all the others except the others never actually get to fight Big Foot. They see him and he's always just off camera or have just evaded them, these guys are just a bit closer to the action. The similarities make the other Cryptid shows feel like this is parody and its making fun of them, but its not. This show isn't cynical it just isn't sinister. Rather than saying ""Big foot is real, what else is the government lying to you about?"" it says ""Bigfoot is real, what would happen if we fought him?"". 

More than anything else what Mountain Monsters does is embrace its concepts honestly. It is very honest that these things aren't real and that honesty is what has kept it going much longer than other shows in its genre.

Masculinity, as a concept, stripped away from the toxic aspects and the real world consequences is a bit silly. Many of its ideas are behind the times and the new versions of it that are made are often time so tangled with other ideas that just aren't appealing. The cool masculine hero of our past is often filled with so much cynicism that they come off as a silly... but masculinity from the outside looks silly so why add the cynicism? From the outside looking in masculinity silly as a bunch of dudes fighting imaginary monsters in a forest but just because something looks silly from the outside doesn't mean it should be a joke. If you can distill the positive aspects of what drew people in something new, fresh, and honest. 

I can't control the zeitgeist. I don't know what each culture's current view of masculinity is and I can't control what it will be in a hundred years, neither can you. The people who ran other ghost hunting and cryptid shows couldn't control when cable tv died and Discovery dropped all of them. The concept of Masculinity, like imaginary monsters, have existed alongside us throughout our species existence... a bit before. The idea of ceding it to the worst of us isn't a winning strategy politically when, instead, we can embrace it with honesty. Accept it in its entirety and de-tangle the toxic aspects. If in the end embracing your masculinity becomes going into some bushes and pretend fighting Moth Man, then brothers, enbies, and masculine ladies... you gotta keep your eye out because I hear he spams teleport like a pussy.

Ian's work is essentially a mimicry of the work of Slavoj Zizek, donning Marx and Lenin so as to deradicalize left leaning audiences and provide an artificial-counter-hegemonic-dialectic system.

This Counter-Hegemonic dialectic requires the viewer to buy-in to a set of unspoken presuppositions in order to continue to consume the product ( Artificial Counter Hegemony ).

&amp;#x200B;

There is a neurolinguistic element to this that goes undiscussed even in radical circles. The speech patterns Ian, Slavoj, various BreadTubers, other influencers etc use are extremely effective with their respective audiences and it is doubtful such results are incidental or a matter of talent. Rather, there seems to be a reproducibility and a functional necessity for the manner of speech of various influencers of this caliber so as to save-face amidst real-time &amp; mass scrutiny.

&amp;#x200B;

There is, in a sense, an establishment of legitimacy in the Mind's Eye of the viewer and in a Hegelian fashion this legitimacy rests on presuppositions that the algorithm can detect and cater to, such that dialectically every insight one obtains is recuperated in a manner that the algorithm is tailored to match to presups &amp; dialectical off-ramps from those pre-sups.

Steven Bonnell takes a similar approach to political method, with a slight difference being the lack of a Counter-Hegemony and producing more of a Neoliberal Apologia.

I understand, national security and all. There's a channel of fart-huffers that go in depth about the Bourgeoise's greatest achievement being Security.

How can someone be a ""leftist"" and support Empire ? 

Don't so many contemporary analyses suggest our Empire is failing or in decay ? 

If we take a more complex reading of Material Conditions nationally &amp; internationally, it seems more the case that across United States conditions are almost as dire as the Imperial Periphery.

One can argue that the ""Imperial Core"" is comprised of organic as much as inorganic matter. The Bodies of Armed men but for Capital.

Slavoj takes the concept of the displacement of class struggle, but relegates this displacement to an abstract characterization of 'the' culture war (( read: a concrete subject )).

But on closer examination, the culture war acts not as a concrete manifestation of class struggle but as a diversion from it.

I believe it is necessary to take a reading of Hegel &amp; Marx that centers not only Production but ReProduction.

As sociopolitical agents, all subjects to some extent reproduce culture. The reproduction of hegemony is intended to, by way of social contagion, bring about a common consciousness where social pressures could never permit dissent.

In fact, given enough time, in a Hegelian fashion, history progresses for some subcultures in such a way that those subcultures experience Cultural Amnesia.

Two examples in the case of the Americas being 'Black' &amp; Indigenous American's loss of cultural heritage, the literal and figurative rape of their cultures at the hands of continental European colonizers.

So what then is the purpose in the production &amp; reproduction of Artificial or Psuedo Counter-Hegemony?

Instead of a Cultural Amnesia, the experience is one of a completely Synthetic Culture.

This is not dissimilar from ""doublethink"" however the Mechanisms are neurological.

Using the technological sophistication we have today, Ian, Steven, and other potential ops are doing wet-ware hacking in real time.

Through the production &amp; reproduction of Synthetic Culture, history progresses within the parameters of a contemporary international bourgeoise whose tentacles capture the very future of public consciousness itself.

But where did that come from? I remember media, shows on TV (literally pick one and it's like this) treating it this way. Literal cartoons and sitcoms for children. That relations between boys and girls is for boys to have to create tactics to crack through the shells of girls to even befriend them or get lucky to befriend them. On the flip side, shows aimed at girls (from my boy memories) involved manipulating boys into situations to allow boys to think they cracked the shell if the girl was pursuing. Girl: I have to make a situation to make it easier for him to pursue/Boys: I gotta figure out the chess moves to pursue. 

It's framed since childhood as fucking combat.

And it's really taken for granted that men want sex in the first place. Toxic masculinity here we come. Sex and the ability to get it is sold as part of your worth as a man. If you don't want sex, this is viewed as abnormal. ( This is deeply out of my wheelhouse so I'd love to read some aro/ace people's perspective on this) there's this feeling that something is wrong with you. ""As a man you SHOULD want sex."" Being able to pull is seen as masculine. Not being able to is seen as failure. Why? I think we should change the way we think about this. We should probably remove these things from masculinity.

I PERSONALLY needed to be explicitly told that it's ok for men don't need to have sex to be masculine. Because having to learn that on my own was an ordeal.

Cw: r*pe, personal cringe

My first time being intimate, I was doing some over the clothes fooling around with my girlfriend. And she asked ""Do you want to have sex."" And I felt trapped. I had to say yes. ""Men don't say ""no"" to sex, I'm not a f*ggot."" I thought, not knowing I was bi at the time. I regret my first time. I didn't know I was allowed to say ""no"". No one told me, no media that I can think of gave me the option.

Later, I would learn that I could say ""no"", inside of a relationship entirely out of lack of stamina. One day, at a party, I told my partner that I didn't want to be intimate that night. She loaded me up with shots while telling me she was going to enjoy me anyway. She did. It took me years to realize I was r*ped. No one told me, I had to figure that out myself by doing the old ""flip the gender"" trick.

Later than that, I learned men can say ""no"" to sexual advances from people you weren't in a relationship with. No one told me that either.

And since learning those things, I'm more confident about relationships with everyone, men and women, than ever before. maybe there is something to that. Maybe I'm just a fucking idiot and everyone already knew this.

But idk, I haven't read any feminist theory.

That relations between boys and girls is for boys to have to create tactics to crack through the shells of girls to even befriend them or get lucky to befriend them. On the flip side, shows aimed at girls (from my boy memories) involved manipulating boys into situations to allow boys to think they cracked the shell if the girl was pursuing. Girl: I have to make a situation to make it easier for him to pursue/Boys: I gotta figure out the chess moves to pursue. 

It's framed since childhood as fucking combat.

And it's really taken for granted that men want sex in the first place. Toxic masculinity here we come. Sex and the ability to get it is sold as part of your worth as a man. If you don't want sex, this is viewed as abnormal. ( This is deeply out of my wheelhouse so I'd love to read some aro/ace people's perspective on this) there's this feeling that something is wrong with you. ""As a man you SHOULD want sex."" Being able to pull is seen as masculine. Not being able to is seen as failure. Why? I think we should change the way we think about this. We should probably remove these things from masculinity.

I PERSONALLY needed to be explicitly told that it's ok for men don't need to have sex to be masculine. Because having to learn that on my own was an ordeal.

Cw: r*pe, personal cringe

My first time being intimate, I was doing some over the clothes fooling around with my girlfriend. And she asked ""Do you want to have sex."" And I felt trapped. I had to say yes. ""Men don't say ""no"" to sex, I'm not a f*ggot."" I thought, not knowing I was bi at the time. I regret my first time. I didn't know I was allowed to say ""no"". No one told me, no media that I can think of gave me the option.

Later, I would learn that I could say ""no"", inside of a relationship entirely out of lack of stamina. One day, at a party, I told my partner that I didn't want to be intimate that night. She loaded me up with shots while telling me she was going to enjoy me anyway. She did. It took me years to realize I was r*ped. No one told me, I had to figure that out myself by doing the old ""flip the gender"" trick.

Later than that, I learned men can say ""no"" to sexual advances from people you weren't in a relationship with. No one told me that either.

And since learning those things, I'm more confident about relationships with everyone, men and women, than ever before. maybe there is something to that. Maybe I'm just a fucking idiot and everyone already knew this.

But idk, I haven't read any feminist theory.
This is really personal and also I don't know if I'm being helpful by bringing this up or I'm just trauma dumping."

395,VaushV,"Watching the discourse around Vaush‚Äôs Andrew Tate take about the left failing young men, and the left‚Äôs hostile reaction to that, really reminds me of how the left reacted to gamergate, and all I can think is that so many leftists seem to have learned nothing from gamergate.

Gamergate, in my opinion, was the single most successful right wing youth recruiting program in recent history.  And the methods they used in gamergate were extremely similar to the methods used by misogynists and PUA‚Äôs like Andrew Tate.

Specifically, they found some major grievance that some large portion of young men had, in the case gamergate, being bullied for being a gamer, in the case of Tate, not being unsuccessful in dating, and they preyed directly on this.  Moreover, they worked to associate the reason for this grievance with ‚Äúthe left,‚Äù and then drag people into right wing politics by making them believe that the left is responsible for their troubles.

And with gamergate, the left just walked right into this.  Left wing game journalists came out with a tranche of articles explaining that ‚Äúgamers were over‚Äù and that gamer bros were all white racist misogynists.  And all the right wing gamergate influencers had to do is point this out and say ‚Äúsee?  These feminists and leftists have been your bullies all along.  You should be on our side.  Watch out content.‚Äù  The point is that these young men were never trying to oppress women in gaming.  They just felt aggrieved because they were bullied as kids, and now they felt the manifestation of their bully in the left.

So now with the recent Tate drama I see a very similar thing.  Young men having a personal grievance with their failures in dating, Tate and co offering ‚Äúhelp‚Äù and then left wing people walking right into the trap by calling the same young men that find Tate ‚Äúmisogynists that just want to protect their male privilege.‚Äù

406,VaushV,"There's a fairly common type of post on this subreddit that goes something like:

\&gt;""Why does this subreddit never talk about X""? or ""You guys never bring up Y on here""

They're almost invariably met with hostility because nobody likes being called out in this manner. Even if the actual sentiment behind the post is warranted and it's a topic we really should discuss.

But ultimately nobody ends up actually learning anything about the topic itself. The post just devolves into bickering about who should do what and ""You're not a real leftist"" and ""You clearly don't care about X group"".

I always tend to leave the same comment on all of them:

\&gt;Make a post informing people about the topic instead of calling out others for not doing that.

I think a similar attitude is what caused the debacle surrounding the whole ""Men"" discourse lately.

Make no mistake, are the criticisms levied against the Left by people like Vaush accurate and warranted? Holy fuck yes. They're only slightly less terrible about the topic than when I was sucked into the MRA/manosphere black hole 10 years ago.

But when the fuck has the Left improved after being called out in such a manner for sucking at something like this? I certainly can't think of a single time.

It only leads to further polarization, infighting and more importantly, not a single damn thing being done to actually bring about a solution.

Does that mean we should stop criticizing the left? Absolutely not. We need to keep each-other in check about harmful attitudes, bad ideas and tactics, misinformation, unresolved prejudice, etc.

But we cannot stumble in the same way the broader Left has against the likes of Peterson or Tate where they debunk and deconstruct but offer no alternatives.

Because if we limit ourselves to pointing out the rest of the Left gives bad advice to and has toxic attitudes towards men without offering any alternatives \*we're literally no better than they are.\*

You have to offer alternatives and solutions to the Left's dogshit approach: ""Here's a video I made, here's a book, here's a podcast, a content creator, a subreddit, idea to make friends in your area, etc.""

Vaush is great precisely because he offers both criticism and alternatives.  The examples above are all things he's done. However, he only does this on stream. I think it would be infinitely more productive to do the same on Twitter. The message could reach potentially untapped audiences if he's replying to a figure he doesn't have much overlap with.

But, perhaps more importantly, I think it could have a really positive effect on how Lefties on there perceive, interpret and potentially twist his intentions and messaging. If people actually see his advice and solutions I believe it would be much less likely that he'd be seen as some ""Incel appeaser"" or whatever.

Vaush is absolutely right when he says the Left isn't a friend group and that he's not in this to make friends. But that doesn't mean everybody hating each-other and forming their little camps doesn't massively hurt our ability to achieve the things we want to see. Am I ***blaming*** Vaush for this? Absolutely not. This is like a built-in feature of the online left. But I think we should try to smooth out the rough edges wherever possible.

430,VaushV,"I was recently watching a live stream of FD Signifier, as I think he's one of the best online commentators when it comes to issues of race. I haven't watched a lot of his live streams, just because I don't watch a lot of YouTube live content, but I've watched a lot of his videos and I think he's on point most of the time. Anyways, on that live stream I was watching, he had this mini rant about how a lot of the online left doesn't challenge the concept of whiteness as an identity enough, and that the online left doesn't realize that whiteness is just a ""property"" of a person rather than an identity, and the right capitalizes on painting whiteness as an identity. Part of this rant was saying that Vaush is a prime example of this, and seemed to be casting shade on white leftists online who make ""one critical race theory video"" but know nothing about critical race theory. Curious if there is some history between FD and Vaush, or if anyone knows if Vaush has talked about FD before. I'm not trying to hold water for Vaush, because he's a big boy who can take care of himself, but I feel like FD's characterization of Vaush in this regard was a little bit uncharitable. I feel like there is some truth to what FD said in his little rant, but I feel that it might have more to do with white leftists online being apprehensive to talk about race issues and would rather defer to POC or remain silent at times to avoid the inevitable infighting that happens whenever anyone says or does something that comes off wrong. Maybe this would be a better question for FD himself, but I feel like this sub might have some relevant thoughts on this subject.

So I keep hearing in leftist spaces about how the working class is gonna rise up. How the people of the world are gonna rise up. 
How any day it‚Äôs gonna happen.
I swear at this point it‚Äôs like Christians saying Jesus is coming soon.

What more would it take?
Like do we not have enough people living in the streets? 
Have enough of your relatives and friends not died from preventable disease or suicide? 
Have enough of you not been worked to death to barely afford absolutely nothing?
Have enough of you not been to your local Walmart or grocery store to see some 80 year old working because they can‚Äôt retire?
Have you not had enough of the greedy fat cats that run the worlds governments?

It‚Äôs a clown show; we are the clowns or tortured animals and the politicians and elites are the ringmasters.

What do I think?
I think this is a pipe dream.
There may be a small group here and there to uprise but overall things are gonna be the same. 

In 100 years from now people will still be doing the same shit we are doing now if we aren‚Äôt destroyed by the coming environmental collapse, overpopulation, or some psycho launching nuclear weapons.

Look I get it - nobody wants to be a doomer. But let‚Äôs face facts - unless we have a mass extinction level event on humanities part the same fucks are still gonna run the show. 

Be good people. Love one another. 
But remember our ancestors (mine included) caused all this. (And yes they caused this regardless of race, gender, religion, etc - don‚Äôt single yourself out. Don‚Äôt pat yourself on the back.

438,VaushV,"Two words: social acceptance

I think people genuinly, liking, loving and appreciating you brings more happiness than rugged individualism, having big villas, having a lot of cars but being actually alone.

Even if you don't have much money I think that people genuinly smiling and happy to see you unconditionally does much more to alleviate isolation feelings.

Trying to obtain money, wealth, power, dominance I think is to fill in the void that is social acceptance, where achieving these things would perhaps give a sheer feeling of it. It is a toxic mentality in American culture where a man must be very individually working hard and be self-made.

Perhaps that is why social outcasts are drawn to extremism, nobody accepts them except for the hands of extremists that reaches them, accepts them and make them radicals, terrorists.

Wouldn‚Äôt it be more helpful to come at this from a gender abolitionist angle?

By focusing on interpersonal relationships more broadly it would be less likely that the conversation devolves into constant dating advice over social advice (while dating advice is helpful it tends to be over focused on due to it being more popular and thus more profitable).

444,VaushV,"I rarely have criticisms for Vaush, so when I do I feel compelled to share them. While listening to his talk with Ana turn to the Azov Battalion stuff, I could tell Ana's feelings were borne out of her experience and the emotion connected to it, which may lead her to being more charitable...however, I also wish Vaush had been a little more open to that fact. While he is an empathetic person, I wouldn't say he's the *most* empathetic person in that kind of setting. And while he was respectful after Ana talked about her friend who killed herself and Vaush had to say ""he didn't see my tweet"", I cringed a bit.

I mean, it was obvious Ana wasn't actually accusing Vaush of making him commit suicide. She was just spilling her guts. She said as much a bit later. I don't know why Vaush felt the need to defend himself there, he could have just let it go. Maybe he didn't connect her emotions to the statement, autism etc. Can't blame him for that. But it did lead me to thinking about how often Vaush relies on his edgy sense of humor during conflict. I had no problem with things like the J.K. Rowling drama. I think there's value in demonstrating the degree of disregard you have for loathsome people. But shortly after listening to this talk, I saw the thread here about Mr. Beard talking about Vaush's ironic misogyny, and I am starting to wonder if there would be some value in him trying to curtail that tendency to fight back with that mocking irony that, for the most part, I get a kick out of.

I think Vaush's penchant for being on the correct side of an issue is kind of a double edged sword. He's so in the habit of defending himself that he does it even when he doesn't need to. That whole Azov discussion with Ana could have been smoothed over pretty quickly if he had just said ""Yeah, I probably should be a little less flippant about that stuff because obviously not all of them are bad people"". I think there have been other moments like this in previous talks, when an easier path opened up for Vaush, but he didn't see it because he was caught up in defending the choice of his original path.

506,VaushV,"The most frustrating thing about this discourse is that if you look at twitter you would get the feeling that many leftists simply cannot fathom that there are conservative or outright fascist women. But my biggest gripe is a fantasy that all women are somehow absolved of the responsibility for the reproduction of culture and of toxic gender norms. When it comes to child rearing, early childhood education, and nurturing roles in general, the bulk of this work falls on women, and so the natural conclusion is that women play a huge role for reaffirming gender roles through raising children. And I cannot tell you how many female friends I have that have had to field toxic grandmas aunts and mothers tsk tsking them following their careers over raising a family or daring to step outside of traditional gender roles in any number of ways. 

When it comes to fulfilling prescribed gender roles there are cultural rewards for aligning with them and punishments for deviating. In conservative communities, the matriarch of the family is commonly a seriously powerful figure. Yes, she is oppressed politically and economically dependent, but as the old adage goes ""if mamma aint happy aint nobody happy"" - this is all to say **that there a lot of traditional/ conservative women that feel they have something to lose in dismantling the patriarchy as well, will defend it, and are raising men traditionally masculine.** You see this when men try to move into more nurturing roles. Speaking from experience as a school teacher and from hearing from other men in nurturing roles, women will sometimes aggressively protect traditionally women's spaces

The disposition that men consciously choose uphold patriarchy is naive and simplistic and will not be solved with ""giving advice to lonely men."" Women's cultural role has been expanded far beyond simply motherhood and housewifery through sustained social activism to include leadership roles and careers. The same has not happened for men. And so now the situation we have is that men have no viable cultural template beside traditional masculinity, while simply being told ""do better"" at best and ""your problems don't matter you whiner"" at worst. We need to revolutionize the concept of masculinity in the same way. I mean, the only advice my own father was capable of giving was ""just don't do what I did.""

This is not solved solely through ""giving advice"" or providing good role models. That is important, but we need to start from the very beginning, raise boys to play with dolls and normalize them being nurturers. Normalize them crying when they are sad. Because right now, they are given a toy gun and truck, told to keep a stiff upper lip, **socializing them form birth to be laborers and warriors**. This will also help women, because surprise, if you liberate one gender to purse economic independence but don't normalize nurturing roles for the other, then they will be expected to carry the burden of both (""LEAN IN GIRLBOSS""). In tandem with social programs funding women in STEM, we need the same aggressive social political push to get men into early childhood education, child care, nursing etc. 

God bless you if you read all that, wanted to get my thoughts out into the ether. I love you.","Women share responsibility in the reproduction of culture and the support of toxic masculinity, some thoughts on socialization *RANT*",1672994825,"Women share responsibility in the reproduction of culture and the support of toxic masculinity, some thoughts on socialization *RANT* The most frustrating thing about this discourse is that if you look at twitter you would get the feeling that many leftists simply cannot fathom that there are conservative or outright fascist women. But my biggest gripe is a fantasy that all women are somehow absolved of the responsibility for the reproduction of culture and of toxic gender norms. When it comes to child rearing, early childhood education, and nurturing roles in general, the bulk of this work falls on women, and so the natural conclusion is that women play a huge role for reaffirming gender roles through raising children. And I cannot tell you how many female friends I have that have had to field toxic grandmas aunts and mothers tsk tsking them following their careers over raising a family or daring to step outside of traditional gender roles in any number of ways. 

When it comes to fulfilling prescribed gender roles there are cultural rewards for aligning with them and punishments for deviating. In conservative communities, the matriarch of the family is commonly a seriously powerful figure. Yes, she is oppressed politically and economically dependent, but as the old adage goes ""if mamma aint happy aint nobody happy"" - this is all to say **that there a lot of traditional/ conservative women that feel they have something to lose in dismantling the patriarchy as well, will defend it, and are raising men traditionally masculine.** You see this when men try to move into more nurturing roles. Speaking from experience as a school teacher and from hearing from other men in nurturing roles, women will sometimes aggressively protect traditionally women's spaces

The disposition that men consciously choose uphold patriarchy is naive and simplistic and will not be solved with ""giving advice to lonely men."" Women's cultural role has been expanded far beyond simply motherhood and housewifery through sustained social activism to include leadership roles and careers. The same has not happened for men. And so now the situation we have is that men have no viable cultural template beside traditional masculinity, while simply being told ""do better"" at best and ""your problems don't matter you whiner"" at worst. We need to revolutionize the concept of masculinity in the same way. I mean, the only advice my own father was capable of giving was ""just don't do what I did.""

This is not solved solely through ""giving advice"" or providing good role models. That is important, but we need to start from the very beginning, raise boys to play with dolls and normalize them being nurturers. Normalize them crying when they are sad. Because right now, they are given a toy gun and truck, told to keep a stiff upper lip, **socializing them form birth to be laborers and warriors**. This will also help women, because surprise, if you liberate one gender to purse economic independence but don't normalize nurturing roles for the other, then they will be expected to carry the burden of both (""LEAN IN GIRLBOSS"").

507,VaushV,"I work in a restaurant. Just below casual dining, and above normal fast food. So we have to shape our groups into special skills and talents into certain roles, and what not. Its a regional restaurant slowly going national.

But not everybody plays by rules or even the relaxed version of them. I have had to work around High School Students, College Students, Adults, and once or twice, middle aged folk. I have no problems with the Students of either group, and know my requirements and expectations. It is the Adults that I have a tough time handling. 

See, since managing my shift, I have had two instances that really set me off into a bit off of a ""what Am I Doing"" mindset.

The first instance is where a worker feels like if they get the orders back it was ""disrespect""; even to so far be talking trash to herself about the situation on how ""everyone is disrespecting me and they can't just send the stupid orders out""..... even though they sent it half complete. I had to write them up for calling in sick on a holiday, and gave them room to get a doctors note so they didn't get written up. Unfortunately, miraculously they were completely healthy the next day, I had asked if they had a Doctors note, they snickered and said ""no"" and told them to sit at a booth while i get the paperwork ready. They were confronted, and they ""didn't know"" about the penalties of the stunt, and gave them an opportunity to accept that it wasn't right leaving us short staffed. They attempted to shift everything on how everyone is hostile to them, she is disrespected, and how the ""disrespect"" started with me correcting her on not sending out full orders and incorrect orders. 


The other one, loves to consistently and inconsistently show up late. Never aesthetically positive, never looking like they are motivated. One night, my Subordinate but still Manager Coworker, was sick and tired of the tardiness, so he decided to start paperwork if he didnt show up. The employee said they were running late, Then the emplyee decided to call in hours after to another worker who isnt managerial staff. Basically, not an acceptable form of calling in, and by technical company policy, a No Call No Show. The next day, we talked with the manager who did the write up, the employee, and I. I was mainly the witness but chimed in once in a while. The employee claimed he had a mental health day, but reminded him that im not going use that against him, but the way in which he did it and calling in AFTER his clock in time to a worker, my hands were tied, and i had to subtly threaten his job with a ""last chance"" write up as his first warning. Initially, i was only going to do regular old ""can't be doing that, dude"" write up, but my boss said to up grade the status of the penalty or HR and corporate would send it back down for an upgrade in penalty. It was the only write up I felt bad doing, because my follow manager who was outside of this situation, said it was messed up that his first warning was essentially ""hey, if you make even the smallest mistake, youre fired"". I agreed, but what is my manager, or I supposed to do? Become jobless myself?

I like to think im an Anarchist of some sorts, but the past week i have felt very unsure, and very rocky on my principles since this job happened. I am living a better lifensure, but really, is the whole ""seperate the personal and proffessional"" even true, or is it some falsehood? Am I doing something wrong?

Anyway, much as I want to commend for his willingness to acknowledge legitimate male grievances, especially in a space that I would consider fundamentally anti-male, I feel like he's missing the forest for the trees here.

Vaush seems to think the Left's problem is messaging. That if they just word their propositions properly, young boys - and presumably, men in general - will flock to them as they are flocking to the Right right now.

I disagree. I think the problem's a lot more straightforward - the Left simply doesn't have anything to offer men.

They refuse to make any impositions on women, or offer men any perks to offset women's natural advantage in dating and relationships. Vaush is 100% correct when he says sexual disenfranchisement is what ends up pushing men to the Right because the Right at least *claims* to have a solution. If the other side can't even be arsed to do that, then what's the point?

And I can't stress this enough, finding a romantic partner is the primary driver for most men. No amount of social benefits paid you can offer by taxing of the wealthy can substitute that. Men are actually not that materialistic. Their drive for material goods is mostly informed by a desire to impress potential female mates.

538,VaushV,"Seeing the recent discourse and the openness about isolation from the left with men I wanted to bring up an issue that I‚Äôve always had on my mind and repeatedly tried to bring up but faced nothing but extreme shaming and backlash.

Similarly to how incels and young men may feel isolated from the left for a variety of reason, TERFs fall into this too. The left can be so vitriolic to TERFs (and I get it, they attack minorities and make life worse) that it actively drives them away when they‚Äôre genuinely trying to understand and integrate.

To get personal: I was a victim of a brother who molested me as a child. From there I have had the unfortunate experience of rape which happened twice. Due to these experiences, I turned toward TERF spaces because they provided easy answers and actual sisterhood and support. When you grow up as a woman, sexual misconduct and objectification of your body is SO common. That‚Äôs an unfortunate and inseparable part of womanhood (yes, this includes trans people too!!). Men in real life were often misogynistic or would hit on me wanting sex. Women in real life all shared their stories of sexual misconduct. Those things lead me down a cynical rabbit hole. I ended up a TERF because it was the only place that felt like it ACTUALLY cared about the endemic sexual assault issue women face, being made into prey. 

I‚Äôve told people that many TERFs (not all, but most) are very traumatized women who have spent their lives being harassed, sexually abused, and belittled. They end up in these spaces because the general societal attitude to sexual violence victims (this also includes men btw) is to be belittled, not believed, doubted, or ignored. So many of these women feel distrust for men and those who defend them. TERF spaces prey on this trauma and weaponize it against men and trans people. 

The problem is that a lot of the left is unwilling to reach out to TERFs or help them. When I opened up about being a TERF and looking to understand opposition, so often I‚Äôd be met with nothing but extreme aggression and mocking. When I saw leftist spaces they were full of people making fun of TERFs and attacking them. Now that I‚Äôm not one, I understand why the left does this, but as a TERF it felt isolating and like this group was siding with abusers and unwilling to listen to women with traumatic experiences. When I saw ironic misogyny, it genuinely just reinforced what I believed about men, even leftist men. And all these experiences were echoed by other TERFs.

I know my rant has gone on a long time but the guys here sharing their story of being pushed to the right and how the left not being open to helping them made me want to also point out that the left is unwilling to deradicalize TERFs or have a left-wing role model to help which has made a lot of traumatized people fall into the rabbit hole. These types of traumatized women are the result of the patriarchy in the same way incels are. But isolating and belittling doesn‚Äôt work.

While I used to watch Vaush as much as the next subreddit user here, I‚Äôve recently felt less interested in listening to him and now generally agree more with the Zoe Baker(Anarchopac) critiques of Vaush.

But that‚Äôs not necessarily what I‚Äôm talking about.

What I want to talk about is what exactly is Vaush‚Äôs objective(ends) and what whether his ""deeds""(means) can achieve those ends.

Let‚Äôs face it, even without the made up controversies by alt-righters, the man is a not known for being gracious about what he says or does.

I guess what I mean is this: 

On one hand: he wants to help grow the leftist movement (advocating for restauratrice justice for young men who are facing the drawback of patriarchism, amongst other things).

On the other hand he is (willingly or not) a PR nightmare, between trying to justify the usage of the word ""retard"" his usage of ironic misogyny,racism,etc.

Essentially, I feel he wants to help grow a leftist movement without wanting to be more responsible for his words and actions.

The thing is, sometimes it feels like he‚Äôs more interested in growing his youtube channel and his fanbase than growing a leftist movement in general.

I understand he believes he serves a niche(a right wing to leftist pipeline) but then what after that?

I know now he‚Äôs focusing on debating conservatives, and I‚Äôd be probably better if he went on Tim Pool again.

557,VaushV,"Hey everyone, i have recently come to a conclusion that i hope is wrong and i would like to have some input from a you. I do believe that male role models are not compatible with equality/parity. Don't kill me yet, let me explain. 

In light of the recent discussions about Andrew Tate that i think that we should have positive role models for young men that are not right wing grifters and fascists. I do further believe that what draws young men to these cults is the focus on dating and ""how to get that pussy"". The solutions these types of people give are obviously contradictory, wrong and harmful to society in general, but they are successful nonetheless.

A pretty good generalization for dating in general is that women are the choosers and men need to make some effort in a social hierarchy. What counts as high status things in society is usually determined by a competition between men. I.e. the jobs with the highest status require intelligence, discipline and a willingness to take risk.
 Men are usually willing to riskier and unpleasant things, since it comes with an increase in status. However the status of a job is also pretty directly connected to the amount of women in these fields. We can see this in occupations such as nurse or teaching. Teaching is a good example, since it used to be male dominated, high status and well paid, and has since went towards being female dominated, less status and thus less paid. https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/org/w/wgs/prize/eb04.html
I believe that the causality is unfortunately ""More women -&gt; Less status for an occupation -&gt; less money"". This is obviously a problem in its own right, and needs to be adressed, but viable solutions are mostly targeting the money part of this equation, and not the status loss of these jobs. (""pay teachers more money and increase funding in education""). The status loss of these jobs is harder to address.

If we take this into account, is it even possible to find male role models in education, jobs and the household, when we have parity in the sex distributions? Wouldn't an occupation that is equally filled with women and men no longer be seen as that attractive for men, because they cannot increase their social status by doing said occupation? Does that mean, that gender and sex equality is doomed to fail, because we go against human dating behaviours? 

 I have though about this for way to long, but i cannot find a flaw in my argumentation. There are probable cofactors for a status decrease in jobs other than ""more women in them"". I.e. less demand due to a changing environment (No one needs stablemasters anymore, since we have cars), or a circular dependency on the amount of money earned, but the number of women in these occupations seems to be a considerable and direct factor. Money could be a confounder of these two things (Jobs that pay less might not attract that many men, compared to women), but i don't think this argumentation holds. There are some high paying jobs that do not attract men, like psychotherapist, or nowadays even higher education in general. So this means that the money you get for a job does not influence the percentage of women in it as directly as it might seem. 

What do you all think about this argument? Is it possible to have equality and not have status loss in an occupation so that we can live happily ever after? Do Men need some domain purely for themself to have a successful dating life? If this cannot be the job market (because we are not the Taliban and want equality and women should be allowed to work), where else can men be useful and compete in male dominated spaces and find positive role models?","How can we create male role models, and have equallity and parity at the same time?",1672950197,"How can we create male role models, and have equallity and parity at the same time?

592,VaushV,"The concept of ‚Äúsmall dick energy‚Äù is absolutely a form of body shaming and to pretend otherwise requires a lot of dishonest mental gymnastics. 

There isn‚Äôt really a comparable female coded ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or ‚Äúsyndrome.‚Äù But there is an equivalent form of body shaming. ‚ÄúA fat personality‚Äù is a term used to describe someone who, regardless of their weight, is slobbish, lazy, gluttonous or the myriad over other moral failings society has tied to being physically overweight. 

This we recognise is a form of body shaming. Even when you level this insult against someone who‚Äôs skinny, you‚Äôre still summarising whatever laziness or gluttony they‚Äôre displaying as fat behaviour. Fat remains the insulting term. It also reinforces the links between moral weakness and being overweight, even though the two are not necessarily linked. Furthermore it still adds to the pressure physically overweight people feel to appear exceptional temperate, hard working or in an eternal struggle to loose weight, signalling to people that they‚Äôre not ‚Äúone of the bad fat people.‚Äù 

Small dick energy functions the same way. You‚Äôre linking toxicity to the length of a guy‚Äôs dick. So while they‚Äôre dick size isn‚Äôt actually relevant, a well endowed person can still be said to display small dick energy, your still reinforcing the idea guys with small dicks will necessarily be insecure, toxic and chauvinistic. 

This gives guys with small dicks (or even average sized dicks) another source of insecurity. Not only are they being told by society that they may be undesirable as a consequence of something they have no control over, now they‚Äôre being told that you masculinity will never be complete or real because you don‚Äôt have the cock to match. Small dick energy is a concept that reinforces the idea that ultimately the be all and end all of a man‚Äôs worth is the size of his dick.

Now, to clarify. I don‚Äôt think Greta did anything wrong in using the term. In decades past to say a guy ‚Äúthrows like a girl was considered a normal thing to say. Similarly, insulting men‚Äôs height or their dick sizes is something that at this moment society considers acceptable. I think a there‚Äôs two reasons that Greta‚Äôs use of the term got anyone‚Äôs attention at all, and both are because she‚Äôs a woman 

A) It‚Äôs triggering for a man to see a woman seemingly admit that dick size is something that she cares about.

B) As feminism has gained more ground men are being put on blast constantly for body shaming women. It‚Äôs ceased to be acceptable to body shame women and the hypocrisy is pretty rank.

I‚Äôd also like to clarify that don‚Äôt think Greta is being a hypocrite or that she believes that guys with small dicks are fundamentally bad. She used body shaming language because society gives very little push back to body shaming when it targets men. Women adopt this language from men.  We live in a patriarchal society. Men set the expectations for what men ought to be. 

A lot of reactionaries melted down over Greta‚Äôs use of ‚Äúsmall dick energy‚Äù but the this backlash was deeply hypocritical. Because, as is the case with the Jordan Peterson subreddit, that community has no issue with body shaming when isn‚Äôt directed at men. And also because men are the principle source body shaming for other men. 

If men take the view that ‚Äúsmall dick energy‚Äù is an offensive term, and want it‚Äôs use to be retired then they need to do two things:

1) Educate themselves about shaming, and respect when less privileged groups have asked that offensive language be retired. 

2) Ask respectfully that others, but especially other men, remove ‚Äúsmall dick energy‚Äù from their vocabulary. 

And finally, as leftists, if a man asks in good faith that you stop using ‚Äúsmall dick energy‚Äù or any of a host of other similar terms, then stop. It costs us nothing, we lose nothing.

603,VaushV,"Yes the patriarchy negatively impacts men and it‚Äôs important we offer solutions to those problems in addition to women‚Äôs problems.

But what exactly are we basing men‚Äôs loneliness on? There‚Äôs some medical journals that say ‚Äúmen aren‚Äôt working as much‚Äù or ‚Äúmen have less friends‚Äù or some vague statistic about how men are feeling isolated.

First of all we‚Äôre just coming off a once in a generation global pandemic; everyone is feeling lonely. We‚Äôve had millions of Americans die, loved ones, yeah? I‚Äôd be willing to bet women are feeling pretty lousy right now too. Everybody is. Inflation is up, people are poorer now than they‚Äôve ever been. 

7,000,000 able bodied men aren‚Äôt working, and we‚Äôre calling that a crisis of masculinity? Oh other countries aren‚Äôt noticing the same decline huh? Labor sectors are obviously extremely different across continents but I‚Äôd be willing to bet lots of other countries are noticing a downward trend in labor participation. 

It just seems silly to me‚Ä¶ where making a mountain out of a molehill saying 18-24yos don‚Äôt have friends (also subjective wtf a friend is because I know some people consider co-workers friends and I sure as fuck wouldn‚Äôt). And our only evidence is a few medical studies which basically say ‚Äúmen say they are unhappy and men say they have no friends‚Äù except the friend part seems super subjective and unhappiness is pretty fucking universal these days so causation, correlation? 

Whoa 7 million little worker bees aren‚Äôt working and say they‚Äôre sad and don‚Äôt find it easy engaging in meaningful relationships? After a global pandemic, death of democracy in america, sky high inflation, millions dead from sickness, no less? You don‚Äôt say.

I need more proof of a crisis of men, I think a large large portion of this crisis is manufactured if not for the very least of the left trying to tap into the mra market of politics. But then again I‚Äôm the cynical type.

If anybody has any studies they‚Äôd like to share that proove a crisis of masculinity is currently ongoing in America right now please post them here right and I‚Äôll gladly eat humble pie. But my hypothesis that a lot of this is overblown, exacerbated by pandemic, statistical misnomers of causation vs correlation, and not to mention a lot of the pains we think are only being felt by men SHOCKER are also being felt by women. 

Just weird that all of the sudden we‚Äôre so concerned for Gen Z 18-24s we‚Äôre willing to audit our entire society about it when literally it might just be growing pains. Is anybody else feeling this or am I the lone psychopath on this tangent?

Seems like all the other crisis you can point at and observe (eg War in Ukraine, fight for reproductive freedom, systemic racism) all these have very concrete numbers and are well verified phenomenon but this ‚Äúcrisis of masculinity‚Äù is getting thrown around so much like it just suddenly became this universal truth and I just don‚Äôt by it. At least not with the little information we have now.

Anyways this rant has gone on long enough.",I‚Äôm not convinced the ‚Äúcrisis of maculinity‚Äù is really as big of a crisis as we‚Äôre making it out to be.,1672909833,"I‚Äôm not convinced the ‚Äúcrisis of maculinity‚Äù is really as big of a crisis as we‚Äôre making it out to be. Yes the patriarchy negatively impacts men and it‚Äôs important we offer solutions to those problems in addition to women‚Äôs problems.

But what exactly are we basing men‚Äôs loneliness on? There‚Äôs some medical journals that say ‚Äúmen aren‚Äôt working as much‚Äù or ‚Äúmen have less friends‚Äù or some vague statistic about how men are feeling isolated.

First of all we‚Äôre just coming off a once in a generation global pandemic; everyone is feeling lonely. We‚Äôve had millions of Americans die, loved ones, yeah? I‚Äôd be willing to bet women are feeling pretty lousy right now too. Everybody is. Inflation is up, people are poorer now than they‚Äôve ever been. 

7,000,000 able bodied men aren‚Äôt working, and we‚Äôre calling that a crisis of masculinity? Oh other countries aren‚Äôt noticing the same decline huh? Labor sectors are obviously extremely different across continents but I‚Äôd be willing to bet lots of other countries are noticing a downward trend in labor participation. 

It just seems silly to me‚Ä¶ where making a mountain out of a molehill saying 18-24yos don‚Äôt have friends (also subjective wtf a friend is because I know some people consider co-workers friends and I sure as fuck wouldn‚Äôt). And our only evidence is a few medical studies which basically say ‚Äúmen say they are unhappy and men say they have no friends‚Äù except the friend part seems super subjective and unhappiness is pretty fucking universal these days so causation, correlation? 

Whoa 7 million little worker bees aren‚Äôt working and say they‚Äôre sad and don‚Äôt find it easy engaging in meaningful relationships? After a global pandemic, death of democracy in america, sky high inflation, millions dead from sickness, no less? You don‚Äôt say.

I need more proof of a crisis of men, I think a large large portion of this crisis is manufactured if not for the very least of the left trying to tap into the mra market of politics. But then again I‚Äôm the cynical type.

If anybody has any studies they‚Äôd like to share that proove a crisis of masculinity is currently ongoing in America right now please post them here right and I‚Äôll gladly eat humble pie. But my hypothesis that a lot of this is overblown, exacerbated by pandemic, statistical misnomers of causation vs correlation, and not to mention a lot of the pains we think are only being felt by men SHOCKER are also being felt by women. 

Just weird that all of the sudden we‚Äôre so concerned for Gen Z 18-24s we‚Äôre willing to audit our entire society about it when literally it might just be growing pains. Is anybody else feeling this or am I the lone psychopath on this tangent?

Seems like all the other crisis you can point at and observe (eg War in Ukraine, fight for reproductive freedom, systemic racism) all these have very concrete numbers and are well verified phenomenon but this ‚Äúcrisis of masculinity‚Äù is getting thrown around so much like it just suddenly became this universal truth and I just don‚Äôt by it. At least not with the little information we have now. 

Edit: sorry this is long. And sorry if it sounds like I don‚Äôt care about men‚Äôs issues I obviously do (male suicide, imprisonment, etc.). It‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt think men are in crisis.

Must we have to work to replace masculinity with a positive form or can it just fuck off entirely?

As a gay, this was not that hard, since inherently, an ideal masculinity was out of reach (seeing drag artists confidentally break gender helped too).

This idea implicit in Vaush's video (no I didn't watch all 50 minutes, wasn' tryna self harm) that all leftists are anti-masculinity soy boy beta cuck blah blah blah, and that this turns men off. Is jus reifying the worst stereotypes of modern feminism (or liberalism in the US context, or lefty stuffs more generally), propagated by conservatives. Its dumb af.

Whenevs these nebulous ""left"" discussions take place, its worth remembering how incredibly lopsided the media and information ecosystem is.

The girl boss, 'if only women were allowed to win at capitalism' feminism that inhabits many an advertising campaign or hollywood film. This is the dominant representation because its profitable.

You can find examples of misandry in feminism sure. But reifying and validating the worst conservative takes of, not jus feminism, but the ""left"" more broadly, helps nothing here. All it does is justify men who never took the time to read feminist accounts of masculinity.

These accounts are really important for two key reasons:

1. They teach individuals to be conscious of gendered behaviours, to resist them where they place limitations, freeing people to live better lives in the process (this is not anti-masculinity, its being conscious of our gendered programming).
2. They teach men to look to women as ideological role models (which is a really weird function of society, where the gender binary tells people to treat the other as alien and therefore not relatable or worth learning from)

On 1. I shall post the great Bell Hooks quote:

&gt;‚ÄúThe first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males is not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves. If an individual is not successful in emotionally crippling himself, he can count on patriarchal men to enact rituals of power that will assault his self-esteem.‚Äù

And

&gt;"" ‚Äú**The crisis facing men is not the crisis of masculinity, it is the crisis of patriarchal masculinity**. Until we make this distinction clear, men will continue to fear that any critique of patriarchy represents a threat.‚Äù 

These lines of thought, which I'd kinda clued onto via others before reading Hooks, have been immensely impactful in my development as a ""man"". Feminist shit taught me I'm not ""owed"" a woman. It steered me away from the ""act hard"" egotistic nature that cripples so many males emotional maturity. Its good shit. Its also rarely promoted to young men, cause feminism typically isn't ""for them"" in its presentation.

Now think further, how many breadtubers, or public intellectuals out there that're given prominence, how many of them are women? Is the ""soyboy beta cuck left"" stereotype Vaush endorses (its kinda ironic that he's that stereotype of what he seems to be railing against) really the issue? We don't need ""real men"" for lost boys to look up to (though good lefty masculine blokes of course exist - they typically do shit in the community, fighting the fasc, organising industrial actions etc, rather than streaming all day, or making tik toks).

Where Vaush, and I suspect the lostboys that follow him, do inhabit a shit side of masculinity, is in a combative style of politics. There's nothing to be gained from searching out the dumbest fucking takes on twitter to dunk on. Congrats, you dunked on a moron, arn't you a big strong man. Which is what 95% of the ""content"" is. Its so fucking insecure.

There was a time in the mid 2010s when breadtube was full on inane videos where folks would rail against a nebulous ""left"" that was too up its own arse about identity politics.

We are living in a time where some really interesting power dynamics in gender are changing. Universities are full of women, barely any men. Actually reading and getting deep into subjeccts isn' as masculine as dunking on shit tweets, I suppose.

Young people as a whole are a lot more progressive. We arn't losing ""young men"" to Andrew Tate because the left is shit. Liberalism has failed. Many are turning to fascism as a result. This needs to be staunchly opposed. Validating the worst fascy critiques of the ""left"" isn' gonna help that.

Tate's following might look big on a global scale, but its a really extreme pro rape position, and should be identified as such. No ones going pro rape because a ""soyboy youtuber"" was too woke, or ""antimasculinity"". Wake tf up.

When it comes to young men, feeling feminised by their position in life, here are a bunch of alternatives to getting ""red pilled"" that can be offered:

1. Feel the need to be combative, to pump up the ego? Punch a nazi. Fight the state. Go do some good shit. I've seen a lot of rowdy fucked up blokes better their lives by getting involved with lefty activism.
2. Sad because you arn't getting laid? Try, treating women like people! Being friends with women. These can lead you to meeting other women. Some of them might want to fuck you.
3. Feeling emasculated from crippling depression or anxiety? Seek help! Don't be an insecure incel about it.

623,VaushV,"The Left needs **MEN**...***a lot of men***.

I just cannot imagine a revolution to overthrow the capitalist machinery without angry, able-bodied young men who are willing to use violence for their cause.

It's disenchanting to see the Left develop a phobia towards aggression and violence, attributing it to ""toxic masculinity"" or ""patriarchy"". When in fact, all of the (relatively) successful revolutions in history where done with the use of violence.

Young men today are very angry, because they have been (subliminally) promised by the both government and the corporate establishment that Capitalism is gonna give them happiness or some sh\*t. This pent up should be an indication that they are ready to change things...or die trying. But instead of the Left utilizing that anger to actually achieve what they are preaching, what do they do? **They mock it.** *""Ohh, it's so empowering to watch these poor men feel powerless..""* 

This suppression of men's anger has been extremely beneficial to the government 

Young men are angry but have no idea where to direct it to. We have been conditioned by this capitalist society to suppress our anger. Funny how everyone tells us to be emotionally open...***except when we're angry***, in which case we're simply advised to take a deep breath, go to therapy and take some drugs. But it makes sense though, less angry men = no disruptions of business activities. Angry men left unmedicated is **BAD** for the corporate bottomline.

Men have nowhere to vent their (justifiable) anger to. So guess what, the Ben Shapiros and the Andrew Tates of the world are more than willing to absorb this abundance of attention, and redirect them away from the real culprit...**capitalism**.

And practically ***NO ONE*** on the Left is competing with them!

Suffice to say that the Left has given up on men, believing that we are a lost cause.

But we're not. I myself am a straight man with Conservative values, who have eventually come believe in the ideals of Communism, thanks to people on the Left who didn't treat me as garbage due to my beliefs. But wait, isn't Conservative Communist an ***oxymoron***!?

Not at all. Come to think of it, what do modern Conservatives **actually** believe in? Protection of the family and local community above all else. Distrust towards the government and the corporate establishment. Aren't these at least ***very close*** to what Communism preaches? And I guarantee you, that a gun-toting, Bible-thumping redneck is more likely to rebel against the government than a metropolitan, peace-loving Liberal. I mean, they literally did it on Jan 6 last year.

But, doesn't being Conservative mean being racist? Or anti-feminist? Or homophobic? Absolutely not. Do not mistake a Conservative for a Republican. The problem is that the only people giving Conservatives any attention are f\*ckin' Republicans who have their own agenda.

If we just actually give it a try, we can absolutely bring men to our side.","As a ""ConservativeCisMan"" who believes in Communism, I'm glad Vaush is reaching out to young men.",1672890150,"As a ""ConservativeCisMan"" who believes in Communism, I'm glad Vaush is reaching out to young men. The Left needs **MEN**...***a lot of men***.

I just cannot imagine a revolution to overthrow the capitalist machinery without angry, able-bodied young men who are willing to use violence for their cause.

It's disenchanting to see the Left develop a phobia towards aggression and violence, attributing it to ""toxic masculinity"" or ""patriarchy"". When in fact, all of the (relatively) successful revolutions in history where done with the use of violence.

Young men today are very angry, because they have been (subliminally) promised by the both government and the corporate establishment that Capitalism is gonna give them happiness or some sh\*t. This pent up should be an indication that they are ready to change things...or die trying. But instead of the Left utilizing that anger to actually achieve what they are preaching, what do they do? **They mock it.** *""Ohh, it's so empowering to watch these poor men feel powerless..""* 

This suppression of men's anger has been extremely beneficial to the government 

Young men are angry but have no idea where to direct it to. We have been conditioned by this capitalist society to suppress our anger. Funny how everyone tells us to be emotionally open...***except when we're angry***, in which case we're simply advised to take a deep breath, go to therapy and take some drugs. But it makes sense though, less angry men = no disruptions of business activities. Angry men left unmedicated is **BAD** for the corporate bottomline.

Men have nowhere to vent their (justifiable) anger to. So guess what, the Ben Shapiros and the Andrew Tates of the world are more than willing to absorb this abundance of attention, and redirect them away from the real culprit...**capitalism**.

And practically ***NO ONE*** on the Left is competing with them!

Suffice to say that the Left has given up on men, believing that we are a lost cause.

But we're not. I myself am a straight man with Conservative values, who have eventually come believe in the ideals of Communism, thanks to people on the Left who didn't treat me as garbage due to my beliefs. But wait, isn't Conservative Communist an ***oxymoron***!?

626,VaushV,"I¬¥m not a leftist, but I¬¥m curious about certain comments that Vaush made lately on twitter, and I wonder what¬¥s the general opinion of this forum on this topic. 

Contemporary leftism is polemically situated against heterosexual men, which is a plausible explanation in order to understand why figures like Andrew Tate are fairly famous among young men, and this decision is not arbitrary. 

Vaush tends to de-personalize politics on the basis of ""structures,"" i.e., the Patriarchy exists by itself and is enforced through structures with non-conscious actors. This is a non-voluntaristic view of social relations, which is contradictory since Vaush¬¥s prescriptions are in itself voluntaristic. Vaush argues that young men are not ""Machiavellians"" that support redpill content because they want to ""dominate women,"" and the solution to this issue is to talk to them and present ""leftist"" countermodels in order to attract them to the leftist cause. In this sense, this is an issue of mere political communication and not of ""structural hierarchies.""

Yet, the issue is that if you assume that the Patriarchy exists and it is a system that positions certain men over women in the social hierarchies then you need to assume that at least a portion of males are going to fight to maintain those apparent privileges, what¬¥s then the programatic goal of the Patriarchy? This is the limit of political communication and this is the declarative moment of deciding who¬¥s your enemy, the limit of enmity being the physical elimination of the Other, which in the case of feminism is impossible because it is quite absurd to murder 50% of the population.

If you compare, then, the Patriarchy to Capitalism, then it would be quite absurd to assume that the bourgeoisie is going to surrender their privileges, no? And if you don¬¥t believe this, then I invite you to explain the difference between the Patriarchy and Capitalism in terms of domination (in the process undermining feminist theory). 

You can argue that feminism also benefits men (which is what many leftist do to make feminism more digestible to guys, I suppose), but then there is an issue, if feminism is against the domination of men over women, then what are the social benefits that I gain, as a men, with the destruction of the Patriarchy? There is this Hegelian-Marxist trick which assumes that the slave-master relation also degrades the master, but this is theoretical assumption is not useful for social analysis.

Now, and excuse me if I sound sardonic, but should I give up my apparent patriarchal privileges in order to feel ""emotionally"" better? In the cost-benefit analysis, I think losing social privileges in order to have the ability to wear makeup, cry, and use skirts is ""silly,"" and based on ideological authenticity, which I don¬¥t buy.  

A valid counterargument to my claims would be the question of the existence of males that are feminists. A common response to this argument would be that of stupidity, i.e., male feminists are stupid because they don¬¥t know they are going against their privileges. Yet, I don¬¥t think this is true. Male feminists exists because they gain benefits as a result of their feminism. One punctual example is that of academia, not abiding by the daily doses of administrated feminism might imply losing the opportunity to fight for a certain professional position, or if you are a professor, being an anti-feminist might invite for constant fights and struggles between the professor and the student body (who are ultimately the consumers of education). In this sense, being a male feminist might be a safe bet in the perseverance of your academic existence. 

In this sense it might be a viable tool to make leftists (and feminism) the dominant ideology in society in order to force males into being feminists, but this is merely a totalitarian fantasy, a pragmatically impossible goal. Additionally, feminism (or leftism) are not monoliths and they¬¥re in constant state of evolution (the feminist of today might not be the feminists of tomorrow, and so on). 

Essentially, Vaush¬¥s struggle to convince men like me that his version of leftism/feminism is good for me is not a mere question of political communication but a struggle for forcing ""progressives values"" into all spheres of society, forcing me in the process to abide by the rules of the game of that punctual sphere, and his non-voluntaristic voluntaristic social analysis ignores that there are social relations of domination that set, in a sense, the political struggles in question.",Vaush is Wrong about Men.,1672887362,"Vaush is Wrong about Men.

631,VaushV,"So there are rumors that antifa may attempt to fight the Taliban just like they do with ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Here's why it will end horribly for them.

1. **The Taliban don't mess around:** If there was a pro-Taliban rally in Kabul, and antifa tried holding a counterprotest using ""black bloc"" tactics, and of course punching the Taliban. The Taliban and it's civilian supporters would be quick to react. Unlike the alt right, who are unusually tolerate of physical violence against them, despite being the ""most dangerous extremist threat"", the Taliban wouldn't hesitate to retaliate against any antifa guy that thinks ""punching mujahideen"" is a good idea. Most likely the antifa guy or gal, would get shot, blown (by IED), or beaten to death by the Taliban or it's supporters. Their black clad clothing would antifa too easy to target and spot. On top of that, any civilian shooting a antifa member assaulting them would be ruled self defense. To be fair, I don't how self defense works in Afghanistan, but generally shooting a person for physically assault can be ruled as self defense. In this case, the regime would be proud to do so, if the armed civilian is pro-Taliban.
2. **History:** The Taliban have fought and defeated antifa before, when the Soviet Union-which I know many on the left consider them to be antifa-invaded the Afghanistan and murdered thousands in the name of ""anti-fascism"" and ""progress"", only to get their asses kicked by the based goat herders and predecessors of the Taliban, the Afghan mujahideen. Given antifa loves to display the ""hammer and sickle"" symbol at their protests, the Afghans would be quick to turn hostile on them. To the Taliban, and the broader mujahideen, it will be like the good ol days of the 80s, minus the Hind attack helicopters. I'm sure a lot of them would get nostalgia from killing commies again. The Soviet Afghan war is the reason, why many antifa are scared of setting foot in Afghanistan-and should be.
3. **Opinion:** The Taliban would without a doubt dub antifa as anti-Islamic, outlaw them completely-if they haven't done it already. Given the history of far left oppression in Afghanistan, the people would view antifa or any far left group as ""extremist terrorist"" seeking to overthrow the Taliban and reestablish the democratic republic of Afghanistan. The rest of the world would probably view retaliatory violence against Afghan antifa, as defensive/justified.

IMO, it's a really bad idea for antifa to go to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban, unless if you want to get slaughter and make the mujahideen nostalgic. Punch a Taliban, sounds more like suicide.

652,VaushV,"Note: My reactionary phase was between 2006-2010, but a lot of things were pretty much the same, except we had earlier versions of the same controversies (like The Lion King ""SFX"" controversy instead of Balenciaga). I tried to warn others an impeding reactionary movement the moment someone takes a look at what happened in Hungary, but almost nobody listened to me.

Firstly, I personally didn't even wanted to uphold my own ""privileges"" (which I only had a few of only in certain situations, see later), I wanted to do away with the whole system. However, people told me there's this evil thing called ""feminism"", and they're the reason why I have the issues I had, but the best they could get out of me is to hate feminism for supposed man hating and not caring about real issues like the very low age of consent of Hungary, for which I was called a ""jealous"" person by women I assumed to be feminist for no other reason than they hated me. I still wanted to do away with the system instead of getting a ""tradwife"" that will cook for me and stuff.

Other thing progressives forget are conservative women. They're the *real* golddiggers the reactionaries warned you about. If you're poor, disabled, and maybe even not working a manly manual labor, then you're not a man for them. They think under patriarchy and an ideal man, all they have to do is to give birth to children and cook. Of course they usually get more grounded, since only a fraction of men would have the money to sustain a whole big family from a single income (and sometimes they're programmers, which isn't a manly manual labor), but otherwise they're more vile to you, and since you associate feminism with men hating, you'll see them as feminists regardless of how do they actually feel. If you're in the suburbs or a small town, it'll affect you even more.

There's also the issue of privileges working in context. While as a white guy, I usually had more privilege in life, but as I'm autistic, I've often been treated as a lesser. This also made a lot of advices not working out for me: I'm very quiet thanks to bullying, I have certain repetitive behaviors that are in ""how to tell if someone's lying"" guides, best I can do as masking is to hold back my hand flapping and certain stims, etc.

While progressives sometimes have better advices, they're often worded in a very condescending way (especially about hygiene), and I get a lot more shallow advice on ""confidence"", which is not a thing I can easily give off, or fake (as thoughtslime suggested many times). I live in a small town, and ""leaving the house"" doesn't work at all for me, then I cannot talk to strangers at all at big events like concerts etc. I also can't tolerate alcohol or drunk people, thanks to my alcoholic grandmother.

668,VaushV,"In light of the discourse on men's issues and why people like Tate keep being signal boosted, a topic I've been wanting to discuss with this community is the existence and manifestation of toxic feminity. 

As a black dude, intersectionality has given me a lot of insight into behaviors of differing groups I used to be perplexed by. For example, I used to be (somewhat still am) puzzled by how defensive white people would act in response to claims of historical and economic privileges. Or, the backlash to the conjured image of CRT labeling white people as holistically evil and racist. While it's important to note that, especially in CRT's case, often there is misinformation and willful ignorance at play, some of the knee jerk denial and deflection can be in part explained by a need to preserve one's own morall image of themselves. And this is *bound* to happen due to the inherent nature of language and how marginalized communities express grievance and catharsis.

A staple of black comedy and commentary is complaining about stupid racist stuff white people (and other communities) do as a result of anti blackness and white supremacy. When venting this frustration, often marginalized people use generalized and even reductive language such as ""white people be crazy"" or ""the caucasity"". Of course, while comedic, there is an essentialization that could be interpreted from these comments that understandably draws a knee-jerk reaction from white people where they say, "" thats not me!?"" It could be them or not, but the nature of language, especially outside of academic settings, invites generalizations especially of those who seem to be in the privileged caste. 

I think this directly ties into the broader discussion on Twitter because I think a lot of men (including myself at one time) were/are unreceptive to feminism due to the perception of impugning their character without knowing them personally. While the twitter discourse clearly shows that a strain of flat-out misandry is alive and well within some circles of progressives/left, the charitable well adjusted mature take imo is that women simply vent the same way black people vent about white supremacy. Ultimately, just like white supremacy has to be enforced by people, particularly white people, so too does Patriarchy have to be in large part perpetuated by men so this is reflected in the way they complain about men and toxic masculinity. 

Apologies for that long preamble, but I want to make an important distinction that's missed in this discussion, especially in this sub. Race is *NOT* the same as gender or sex. The stereotypes and essentialization of race have been rightfully condemned as immoral and unproductive in  predicting outcomes and establishing codes of conduct. However, I don't think the same can be said of sex. The fact that men predominately make up the vast majority of sexual violence and physical violence towards women is an incredibly important insight into the way women are taught (and of course through their own agency) view men. 

13/50 is a terrible way of justifying fear of black people but its just common knowledge that men can and (often? Idk if its serial offenders or a lot of men) sexually assault and harm women therefore it's understandable why a woman will lock her doors or switch to the other side of the street as I walk by. That's a double standard that's heavily reinforced even or *especially* by the left. And quite frankly, as my empathy for women grew, that *""burden""*  (if I could be a little melodramatic) as a man is something I learned to swallow and accept as an unfortunate reality both sexes have to navigate. 

That being said, you don't have to go full JP or Tate to acknowledge that there is an imbalance in both comedy and serious critique on regards to gender/sex. As said earlier intersectionality has given me a lot of insight, and its pretty obvious that marginalized communities hate being critized, especially if the identity of the person making the critique isn't apart of said community. This is understandable for the obvious reason that marginalized communities in particular women have experienced thousands of years of Patriarchy and its misogynistic outcomes. However, I don't think that is a reason to discourage any discussion both and comedic serious about bad behaviors of both genders. 

Which finally leads to the actual point of the post. Criticizing toxic masculinity is heavily established in leftist/progressive circles for good reason. However, if half the population is women, should some analysis of toxic feminity be available assuming it exists? What are the characteristics of it and how does it harm men and women? If at all, how would women like it to be discussed? I ask all of these in good faith because while I most definitely don't blame women or even the ""left"" necessarily for Tater tot's and his ilk's rise, I do think they base a large portion of their circus act on balancing on a slim pole of valid criticisms and frustration men may have towards women that they abuse to seek in the misogyny.","Is toxic feminity real?

Last night I saw a now deleted tweet claiming that teen girls are disaffected but don't get radicalized like men do and it made me want to scream, because looking back at how I was as a teenage girl I was always close to that line and the few things that kept me from crossing it were basically due to sheer chance. I was a self described libertarian and a 9/11 truther in middle school and by high school a regular 4chan user and super steeped in pop spirituality, the kind that qanon hippies like now. I was alienated and anxious and had no social skills which led me towards hard-core skepticism and hatred of authority, and the only reason it didn't result in me getting dragged into the conspiracy wing of the right was because I happened to be a fan of a handful of anarchist punk bands, meaning all that skepticism and rage got directed at cops which basically caused me to permanently drop anchor on the left.

 I don't know how many of these people making such claims are separated from their teen years. I experienced all this in the late 00s early 2010s and admittedly the internet was a pretty different place, but I think the core problems are the same. I think a lot of people who were on the brink of falling down a right wing pit can attribute them not falling in to a handful of things that were kinda up to chance.

This leads me to believe that a vast majority of men specifically suffer from mental illness of some kind, be it mild or bad. My best buddy who was sorta a player, was on anti-depressive meds.

Similar pipelines already exists in some form for multiple hobby sets and I‚Äôve seen a good niche for ‚Äúcorrect content‚Äù that directly deprograms people who are a few steps down that harmful pipeline.

The best example I have is weightlifting tik tok where the most popular videos are sometimes very harmful habit forming content.

I think the failure of the left isn‚Äôt that we aren‚Äôt debunking these harmful creators, but that we simply aren‚Äôt creating the content that seems apolitical but is also concise, punchy, correct, and helpful for people. We aren‚Äôt meeting their needs of how they want to consume content or what motivates them to disregard future content by future creators.

Some takeaways 
- assume teens are already watching popular right leaning video.
- target topics that are relevant to teens (status, power, being good with girls and friends etc)
- make the other content creators look cringe AF, embarrassment or uncertainty is likely to be the key to influence this cohort. 
- keep the takedowns short, and focus on the viewer and an alternate view they should adopt.
- the goal should be to breakthrough enough to make impressionable viewers wary of certain creators on face value.

I figure that we can capitalize on the same tactics as leftists. What *specific* advice do you have to share for young men who feel clueless? Let‚Äôs try to be more granular than just broad qualitative statements like ‚Äújust be yourself‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a misogynistic asshole‚Äù or ‚Äújust treat women like people‚Äù which amount to empty virtue signaling. How should one approach an interaction with the opposite gender? How do you keep a girl‚Äôs attention? What do girls find attractive? How do you foster a non-platonic interaction with a girl without coming off like a creep? What are girls actually looking for in a guy if plenty of girls go after scumbags? Yes, we‚Äôre going there. No I don‚Äôt care if you get upset. We need to start offering guys real practical advice to take that monopoly away from redpillers, and if that entails people generalizing women‚Äôs preferences and tastes for the sake of giving men something to work with, then they have my goddamn blessing."

723,VaushV,"Holy shit, the dialogue surrounding this is fucking insane. Let's break down the two most common reponses to Vaush's suggestion of making active attempts to ensure young men end up being decent. I'm not going to be able to cover all the aspects of this, and there's going to be some conceptual overlap.

1. ""Men are evil."" So quite a few folks seem to be responding to Vaush by saying something akin to ""Men go far right because they're evil and the patriarchy benefits them"". First of all, to the degree that men believe that, they're *wrong*. We need to emphasize that patriarchy is bad for men, first of all because it's *true*, and truth matters, but also because, ""Stop doing things that are good for you"" is pretty weak fucking argumentative position. So many goddamn lefties cede this fucking ground for NO GODDAMN REASON. Obviously the takedown of patriarchy will, in certain select ways, entail that certain benefits are withdrawn from men, but the tradeoffs are objectively worth it. I have happy news: we are not in a position were we have to ask men to be ascetic heroes who sacrifice the bulk of their happiness for the betterment of the world. We have a much easier sell. 

Also, it's more complicated than that. There's never ONE reason anything happens. A person cancels plans with their friends to stay home, the wind blows through an open window to knock over a candle which catches their bed on fire, the fire spreads, the fire truck breaks down on the way to the scene, and the person dies. What's the cause of their dying? The canceled plans? The truck breaking down? The physics of the universe allowing for combustion? Everything that happens is due to a huge network of stuff. Men go far right because of an enormously complicated network of factors with a lot of variation across time and place and from person to person. Which brings me to:

To some degree men might go far right because they selfishly believe the patriarchy benefits them, but that's a piece of the puzzle. Layered on top of that is a ton other bullshit: uncertainty aboir how to be masculine, a lack of role models, the atomization of society, shame, capitalism, a million other things I've forgotten about. Also, let's not forget: they are being actively recruited my people like Tate who use deliberate measures to target young men. So many fucking people seem to be acting like dudes going dark side is just some spontaneous generation thing, like it just happens because it happens. Motherfucker, people are MAKING it happen. Jesus. 

So the question is: which factor(s) do we address in particular to prevent a phenomenon? Like, with the above fire example, we could implement changes to check up on fire truck engines more often, or we could do PSAs about the danger of candles, or we can pass laws to make bed sheets more fire resistant, or a number of other things. Each of those will have their own rates of success and tradeoffs. So with respect to the issue of men going far right, the question is: out of the innumerable factors that contribute to men going dark side, which ones are the most important to address and how are we going to do it? Giving men life advice from a leftist informed perspective seems like a decent avenue. Maybe not the only one, but that seems like it could be valuable. Young dudes need to see some kind of life to aspire to, some kind of signpost, not as a guru or infallible leader, but *something.*

And...what else are we going to do? Like if men are just Bad TM and there's nothing to do about it then we're straight fucked. You, me, all of us: if all the men being drawn to the far right are INEVITABLY going to go down that path then we should give up. Go home, wait for the end, the planet is doomed. As for me, because I know we're not doomed, I'd like to take steps to prevent doom. 

2. ""Not my responsibility."" Ok, ""responsibility"" as an idea is used in different ways. Do responsibilities need assigned? I guess we have a vague idea of ""socially agreed upon behavior""? At any rate, if we do nothing, we're fucked. Do you care about people? Do you care about yourself? Well, helping prevent men from going far right, and drawing them out it, helps you and others. Easy trolley problem: you pull lever and save everyone. Please don't be the person who lets everyone on the track die (including yourself) just because you didn't start the train and don't think it's your responsibility. Don't be the person who let the world burn because it wasn't your job. 


3. ""You're blaming women for their abuse""..............................no? Vaush was talking to the left *as* the left. All of it: men, women, enbies, etc. Imagine if I said ""driving instructors should emphasize the dangers of drunk driving"" and then you point to a driving instructor who died because of a drunk driver and then you accuse me of blaming the instructor for not doing a good job. What? A lot of this is people conflate the idea of ""blame"" with the idea of ""could have done something to make the bad thing not happen.""


4. ""You want to coddle misogynists"". Look, there's heights and depths to this shit, and not everyone goes dark side because of a lack of compassion, but that is a thing that, to various degrees, can happen in the real world. It's a real thing that has happened, and I have no idea how often, where men feel heard and listened to about their pain by people on the right more than the left, and then they're drawn to the right. Do I think we could have hugged Hitler into being decent? No, probably not. But not everyone is a hitler. Also, do we believe in restorative fucking justice or not? Isn't the essence of that a combination of two basic factors ""we will not accept your harmful behavior"" and ""you are still a human with dignity and we care about you and want you to be better and will help you do be better""?

751,VaushV,"So, many people disagree with the recent tweet (on supporting teenagers and young men so they don't follow a ""self-help -&gt; anti-feminism"" path of decline).

Some of those disagreements are daft, and I like a lot of other people here have commented about that recently, I won't go over it again here.

But don't take every criticism of Vaush's recent tweets as being fundamentally against the idea of helping young men.

For example, Vaush brought up [this tweet](https://twitter.com/SpectrumPulse/status/1610058448879640587), and was like ""I don't get it, why does he disagree?"".

Firstly, obviously, it's twitter, everyone is ripping into that set of tweets for mutually exclusive reasons, because other people are, and it's the trend at the moment to do that, so people who could say something another way are saying it through attacking the tweet if it halfway fits.

But also, how is this disagreement?

It's really simple.

Too many people, including Vaush, are assuming that he's disagreeing on the normative claim:

""It is important that we actively provide alternative models of masculinity for young men, so they, among other things, don't grow up into idiots""

But he's actually responding to the reproving/factual claim tied along with it:

*""And you haven't already been doing that""*

You know if you're in a long term relationship with someone, and they ask you to do something you've just done, you can feel a tinge of irritation?

It doesn't come from the assertion that something should be done, you agree with them that it should be done, rather, it comes from the implicit assumption that they *needed* to tell you, that you didn't already know, and that you didn't already do it.

This is a stupid conversation pattern in a relationship, and one worth staving off for as long as you can, for general happiness, but I believe this tweet is an obvious example of this pattern happening between leftists, and something that has been going for more than just this person in a more veiled way.

-

So about that tweet, has anyone on this sub seen that guy's video? Is it lost somewhere in youtube's algorithm? Probably the latter. (And I like Kendrick Lamar, so I'd personally be interested in that if I knew it existed)

Well, now, by inserting it into this discourse, it has been promoted. Drama sells.

But also...

Conservative people buy ads all the time, they start multi-level-marketing companies to promote themselves, they get free press from liberal TV from outrage or because they whine about ""the media"" not covering something, while it gets directly pushed to fox news etc.

If you or I think the left isn't doing something, there's actually a good chance that someone somewhere *is* in some forgotten corner of the internet, and we just haven't been able to *find it*.

There are probably already people on the left out there doing that, and we just don't know about it.

It's always hard to prove a negative, and although this tweet managed to pull enough controversy to actually get to this guy, which in a perverse internet way is in some ways good..

It's stupid that this guy promoted his video by talking about it in an antagonistic way, and that's how I heard about it, but we should actually be finding ways to cross promote videos and perspectives that actually do help.

The normative call for more efforts to produce content that young men, and particularly, teenagers, recognise as valuable, that's something that we should ideally express in a ""more of this please"", not a *""the left has failed""* form.

Why?

Because it avoids pissing off those people already going unrecognised for their efforts to do exactly that.

Instead, we can say it in slightly different ways, like saying we need to find, promote, and learn from the people already doing that etc.

-

And just like with the version of this exchange in relationships, an adjustment on both sides smooths over the potential arguments; just like it's not someone's fault if they're doing something and it's not being promoted, it's also not your fault that you didn't know, and only saw bad advice in its place.

-

But big picture **TLDR**, don't get all doomer about how no-one on the left cares about men, it's true that some people are angry about the tweet because they don't care, but some are angry because they *do* and don't think they're getting enough credit for how hard it is to actually follow through on that.",Attempt at Angry Leftist to Angry Leftist Translation.,1672787456,"Attempt at Angry Leftist to Angry Leftist Translation.

Noncompete argued that ""The Holocaust was bad Because they were wrong about jews controlling banks"".  Vaush's argument was that ""Even if the banks were controlled by Jews, it wouldn't justify the Holocaust.""  Vaush made this argument by factually pointing out that there was a disproportionate amount of jews working in banks in Germany, which made Noncompete angry and leave.  Vaush then proceeded the debate by saying that Noncompete's logic is one that would allow for something like the Holocaust to happen. 

Before I discovered Vaush, I believed that an essential axiom to being an antifascist is ""A disproportionate amount of people from of group, defined by it's immutable traits, at the top of a hierarchy, does not justify the mistreatment of other members of that group.""  And it is this Axiom that made me believe that Vaush was good when I did discover him.  I had also believed that it was a common Axiom among the left, and was quite disappointed to find it wasn't.

I believe that a lot of the Radfems on Twitter have similar cognitive processes that Noncompete demonstrated in the debate.  A number of ""bad lefties"" perform politics from an area of impotent spite, that is they see the people who are actually responsible but because they cannot do anything directly to those people.  Unlike Antisemites, they often do notice legitimate problems with society and can even come to decent solutions, however they often remain focused on ""Who is at fault"" and the rage builds up inside of them to the point where they outlash against groups of people instead of systems or the individuals at the top of those systems.  One of the ways that social groups aquire more members is by justifying the anger of individuals.  It's a cult tactic, and I am saying that many leftist spaces online are cult like in nature.  We've seen this in the Alt-right Pipeline, and I also believe that it is a part of the Twitter lefty Pipeline.",A Brief Comparison between Noncompete and Twitter Radfem Brainrot.,1672769484,"A Brief Comparison between Noncompete and Twitter Radfem Brainrot.

I AM NOT comparing the modern white men to jews.

I AM comparing the cognitive processes behind Antisemitism to Misandrists on twitter

I am not an essayist much of this is a stream of consciousness, I would like feedback on these thoughts.

784,VaushV,"Did anyone see the movie ""The Red Pill?"" It was a documentary made by this lady, Cassie Jaye. She had tried to become an actress in Hollywood but got discouraged by only being offered roles to play girlfriends or victims or background characters. Instead she decided to make documentaries and one day set out to make a movie about the Men's Rights movement fully expecting to expose them as misogynists, but as she interviewed various MRA leaders she found herself finding their critiques and issues very reasonable; nothing at all like she expected and nothing like the way mainstream feminist sources talked about them.  


Make no mistake. Today I recognize Cassie Jaye as a grifter (or at least very naive). Her film bends over backwards to smooth over a lot of really shitty dudes views and leave out lots of relevant context surrounding certain statistics. The Men's Rights organizations she looks at usually have reasonable issues to discuss on the surface, but once you talk to them for more than 5 minutes things boil down to ""Yea, and it's FEMINISM'S FAULT that male suicide rates are so high!"" and bristling at the concept of toxic masculinity. They're recognizing real problems, but their value ends right there.  


But at the time (especially if you saw the movie and took everything at face value) when I and a lot of other people saw was a single feminist taking the time to actually listen to men and finding that they have problems that society isn't addressing. The anti-SJW/Gamergate crowd absolutely loved this movie because it confirmed what they'd been saying for a while; that they have reasonable problems but no one wants to listen to them because hyper-sensitive feminists have trained society to think ""man=bad"" etc. ""We're the ones with facts and logic on our side and everyone else is just being overly emotional"" was the prevailing thought process.  


\-------------------------------  


The problem with the Men's Rights discourse from that time period was that the MRAs doing it were mostly just whiners who wanted to blame their problems on feminism instead of traditional gender roles (ironically because they had irrationally emotional responses to the word ""patriarchy"" rather than learning what it actually meant).  


Vaush isn't doing this. He's correctly identifying the way we gender men and boys as a society as the root of the issue, and correctly saying that addressing this issue is something all of us should do.  


However ...   


I can understand why some people are reacting the way they are to this current discourse. It reminds them of the same old talking points from pre-2016 Youtube.

795,VaushV,"Speaking as someone who got sucked into the alt-right pipeline and is now a leftist...

I was just thinking while reading some [discourse](https://mobile.twitter.com/taramooknee/status/1610036695176548353) is that a lot of women/people who haven't fallen down the alt-right rabbit hole just simply don't understand it. They get the basis of *how* the misogyny spreads, but not *why* it's spreading. To quote the discourse I linked to;

&gt;to say that alt-right figures show more ""compassion"" to young men than leftists is...a take. have you not seen videos with PUA telling young men that they're pathetic and useless? or incel forums telling them they're unloveable?

This fundamentally misses how relationship dynamics function in incel circles. Yes, there is a lot of negativity in these circles, but for the most part, very few other than super blackpilled people think that the people in these circles are totally irredeemable. Every insult and put-down is bookended by ""You can do better, get your shit together"". There's a certain emotional appeal to having guys in similar situations as you recognize that it's a shitty point to be at in life, but if you throw yourself into self-improvement then you can fix your life. That's why fitness, alternative health, and other communities built around self-help can be susceptible to these things - sad lonely guys looking to improve their lives get legitimate good advice and external motivation, but the misogynist stuff gets added to it so it's easier to ""redpill"" people.

&gt;why are you tying yourself in knots to avoid the major issue of patriarchy? some young men wouldn't even listen to women even if they were compassionate towards them, because they're going to right-wing creators to confirm their biases anyway

Back in GamerGate era, alt-right pipeline types had mastered their craft. Cringe/fail compilations were already a really popular trend, and objectively, a lot of feminists who were in these compilations had legitimately crazy outbursts and poorly represented whatever points about patriarchy they were trying to explain. 

While right-wingers were happy to break down the cringe hysterics and lure people in, there wasn't the same calcuated deprogramming happening from the Left - it was much of the same we see today of ""You are irredeemable and horrible if you follow these misogynists"", with zero empathetic outreach to explain why right-wing interpretations were faulty. There were no large or widespread Leftist content creators, and many who could have effectively debunked these ideas such as Innuendo Studios were just getting started post-GamerGate, and many more not really rising to prominence until the last 6 years or so. 

So I don't think it's necessarily about not wanting to listen to compassionate women - it's moreso about having trusted right-wing sources to get info from. Particularly in the context of the rise of the online Sceptic movement - many people such as myself started getting into GamerGate because the people covering it fron a right-wing perspective had initially gotten viewers through early Atheist content. You had a marginalized and disaffected group of primarily men who were being fed GamerGate info from the lens of ""This content is all about rational, objective analysis. I trust this source because they're logical, critical thinkers who are addressing faults in religious thinking, and many of these crazy feminists are being presented like crazy theologists"".

I think that current feminists and antifascists would do a lot better if they extended some empathy to the incel group. I'm sure it feels counterintuitive to them, but it's wild seeing so many factually incorrect assumptions about how incel communities operate and draw people in. I think Brianna Wu is one of the only cis women I've seen who has an idea of this, but I think that's likely because she was one of the people initially thrust into this.

He plays a character a lot of the time, if you see him go full yeehaw bubba texas conervative that's him playing in to his audience. If you actually ask him about things, he seems to be mostly pro government regulation, pro lgbt+, pro equality and democracy, with some things being somewhat libertarian leaning. I think he might default to libertarian in subjects where he doesn't know there is some innate problem he needs government control for, but for things he has knowledge in, you can clearly see him favor government control.

985,VaushV,"This happens again and again. A right wing douchebag rises to prominence. As they rise, leftists immediately point out why they suck. Liberals do the same, but often prioritize the wrong things (think of how CNN focused so much on Trump's tweets and not his policies). Rightoids fall in love head over heals.

Eventually, the right wing douchebag reveals themselves to be such a disgrace and embarrassment that even rightoids can no longer deny it. At this point, rightoids start to distance themselves from the aforementioned douchebag. Think of how rightoids began to distance themselves from George W Bush around 2008/2009 (same time as the 2008 financial crisis and Bush having record low approval ratings) and even began to shamelessly claim the the right was never into him to begin with.

The resolution to the cycle usually ends with rightoids just moving on to another douchebag with more or less the same characteristics, all the while claiming that they were never into the previous douchebag (or that the previous douchebag was actually never right wing enough). Often, the cyle ends with liberals weirdly becoming buddy buddy with the douchebag (as what happened with George W Bush).
