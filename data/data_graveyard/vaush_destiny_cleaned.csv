As in, I don't think the lack of attention had to do with her physical appearance but rather because she didn't go out or she dressed like a church leader.

So she decides to stop and move on to something else.Imqgine we lived in a world with no taboos around sex and sex positivity was the norm.

32,VaushV,"The 2022 Midterm Scorecard. The results are not final in the last few races, and there are still millions of votes left to be counted.However, the final picture seems to have taken shape.**The House** - This looks to be a very narrow Republican Majority. &gt; Between #AZ01, #AZ06 and #CA41, Dems' dreams of holding the House majority probably died tonight.&gt; New House math:&gt; &gt; Dem called/probable (213), incl. #AKAL, #CA09, #CA21, #CA47, #CA49, #CO08, #ME02, #OR06&gt; GOP called/probable (220): incl. #AZ01, #AZ06, #CA03, #CA27, #CA41, #CA45, #CO03, #NY22, #OR05&gt; Toss Ups (2): #CA13, #CA22 &gt; &gt; Dems need a miracle now.It has not been called, but based on the ballot counts in the final competitive races, Democrats look to be falling short.Given how narrow the majorities are, almost any factor was decisive in this result; If New York's Democratic Party hadn't fumbled so badly, if the DCCC had targeted key races a little bit better, if fewer Democratic incumbents had retired in key seats, if Donors had sent more money to critical swing races, rather than blown it on unwinnable races against MTG or on the doomed Florida Democrats. If the Saudis hadn't cut production numbers of oil right before the midterm, sending gas prices up. If youth turnout had been more like 2018, etc. But while being so close, is of course aggravating, Democrats did avoid disaster, that is typical of Midterms. And now Republicans will have to govern an incredibly narrow House majority. They also have internal recriminations as they blew a bunch of winnable races with freaks and cranks. Their crazies are already issuing demands, and McCarthy doesn't have the votes to just ignore them.&gt;House conservatives propose challenge to czarismHouse conservatives are effectively demanding the Speaker be rendered near powerless, and that bipartisan dealings be halted altogether. And McCarthy still needs their votes to be made Speaker but doesn't want to hobble himself. And if he does submit to their rules, he is going to find it incredibly hard to do budgets, needing a majority of the majority.Also electing Committee chairs sounds like a recipe for making MTG the head of a committee.But while the radicals are issuing demands, Republican moderates don't want to be part of the votes that make MTG the head of a powerful committee. So it's going to be knives out.Republicans are going to be in a mess. And their majority is so narrow, that Democrats will almost certainly be able to push through key things like Ukraine aid via a Discharge petition.. And there is a very real possibility, that Democrats could lend their votes to elect a moderate Speaker. Or depending on the House rules, we could get multiple Speakers, just based on who can get 218 votes at any one time, so the Speaker could flip around a lot.While new sweeping legislation is dead, Biden and the Democrats are going to have a chaotic Republican House as a foil. **The Senate**As called, earlier Democrats have the Senate. With Arizona and Nevada secured they have 50 seats. Warnock of course needs to win his runoff in Georgia, which will boost their numbers up to 51.[Democrats now have Biden's entire first term in office secured for judicial nominees to push back on the far-right takeover of the courts. ]([Of note, is that the GOP might also have a Senate civil war, as many are warming up to calling for McConnell's head]( It remains to be seen how that goes. But if he falls, a much dumber Republican will be in charge of their Senate campaigns in the future, and McConnell might just retire. **Governors and State Legislature races**While the House seems to be slipping out of Democrats' Hands, it looks like Arizona is slipping out of Republicans' hands. &gt; Extremely tough to see how Kari Lake (R) wins now. #AZGOVIn total, Republicans had a terrible run of Governor races. They had a wide slate of races where they thought they had a chance to make pickups. They thought they would make multiple pickups, and hold ground. Instead1. They blew races in key swing states with elections deniers, losing in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. 2. They fell short in their shots in New York and Oregon, though they ended up being close, and down-ballot the close races helped them pick up House seats.3. They got blown out in Maine, running former Republican Governor against the incumbent Democrat.4. They got blown out in Colorado.5. They flopped against moderate Democrat Laura Kelly in Kansas, despite this being a very Republican state.6. They gave away Maryland and Massachusetts, both governed previously by moderate Republicans by nominating extremists, letting Democrats get easy trifectas. 7. And now they look set to lose Arizona, a key swing state.Their only victory was narrowly gaining Nevada with Joe Lombardo, a popular Clark County sheriff. This is a loss, but he doesn't seem to be a MAGA extremist, and given Nevada, the Democratic Governor was likely cooked as soon as he shut down the state for covid, given how important Tourism and gambling is to their state. And he will be put in check by a Democratic State Legislature, which might in 2024 expand to a Supermajority in both chambers.Over the entire course of Biden's Presidency so far, Democrats have lost 2 Governors, Virginia and Nevada and picked up 3, Maryland, Massachusetts and Arizona. A far cry from 2010 when Democrats lost 11 Governors in 2010, and in 2009 had also lost New Jersey and Virginia. Or 2014, where Democrats lost 4. In terms of State Legislatures, Democrats lost no state legislatures, which hasn't happened in a midterm with an incumbent party since the 1930s during the New Deal. Additionally, they picked up* The Minnesota State Senate, completing their trifecta which they last held in 2014.* Both the Michigan State House and Senate, grabbing a trifecta for the first time in over 40 years.* In Alaska Democrats, Independents and moderate Republicans might set up a majority coalition in their state legislature.* The PA State House is coming down to a recount and might flip Democratic narrowly.* Recounts are also in progress in New Hampshire, which would flip the New Hampshire House, Democratic.With the federal level getting locked up by a Republican House, progress for the next two years will rely mostly on remaining executive action, judges or Democratic State Legislatures. And the good news.&gt; How big were Dems‚Äô state legislative gains this Tuesday?&gt; &gt; For the first time in my adult life, more people live in a state with a Democratic trifecta than a GOP oneDemocrats are standing in a strong position for future elections in 2023 and 2024. Republicans are on the back foot.",6698,1114,0.4668,0.089,0.82,0.091

60,VaushV,"Racial Wage Gap: Calling out Saagar Enjeti on Breaking Points for Spewing False Information (Once Again) People need to call out Saagar and other republicans on their false facts. Here is the video: Skip to 11:00. Eventually he says, ""If you look at the median income of white earners and black earners, there is a gap but it is not even close to what the gap is of what we're looking at."" From this, he insinuates that the wage gap that the public is concerned with is some wage gap primarily affected by the top 20%. He is being really weaselly with words here. He makes it seem as though that we aren't looking at the median wage gap and that our data is primarily skewed by the top 20%.When people discuss the racial wage gap, is it fair to agree that we are generally speaking about the statistics provided by the Department of Labor or a similar U.S. entity?The Department of Labor says that black people make $0.76 for every white person's $1. But is that greatly skewed by the top 20%?Pewresearch indicates that the bottom 10% of white people make 2x more than the bottom 10% of black people. Pewresearch indicates that middle class white people make about 50% more than middle class black people. According to statista, 2021 MEDIAN incomes report that white people make a MEDIAN of 78k and black people make a MEDIAN of 48k. That is white people making about 50% more than black people based on MEDIAN income data. It matters little how many white billionaires there are to black billionaires when looking at median income, as we know. This is because 1 white man making 1 trillion dollars annually would not change a median income result if that same white man made 1 million dollars annually (granted that the median income is below 1 million). But how does this compare to the DoL findings above? Well, 1/0.76 = 0.32. This shows that according to the DoL data's AVERAGES, white people make 31% more than black people. According to MEDIANS, as shown above, white people make around 50% more in the middle class range, and 100% more in the poverty range. This means that, the OPPOSITE OF WHAT SAAGAR WAS IMPLYING IS TRUE. As you go LOWER in income, the wage gap INCREASES. Maybe there is some exception when one's analysis gets to incomes above 500k or so, but for people working everyday jobs, the wage gap is MORE SEVERE as you look at lower socioeconomic backgrounds.I hope other leftists don't get misled by Saagar's sneaky words. He, in fact, tried to cite a ""socialist"" when making this really bad point.",2520,448,-0.7441,0.058,0.889,0.053

150,VaushV,"The time I worked with a white supremacist for a day. Okay, so to start with, I'm not making this post to prove any great point. I was just reminded of this, and it's a pretty funny anecdote that I thought some people might appreciate. You will not learn anything about deradicalization here, all of the owns were self-owns, and this happened more than a decade ago so my memory may not be spot on. Treat this as short fiction, I guess is what I'm saying.Okay, so I worked as a painter. Houses, not paintings. At the time, there was a boom going on (it would have been about 2006, in a rapidly expanding urban center) and we were desperately struggling to keep up with multiple projects in a business where people fired for incompetence could literally walk next door and be back to work within the hour. I worked as a foreman for the relatively unskilled part of the crew, and part of my job was that I worked with any new hires to make sure they weren't completely useless before they were sent anywhere by themselves.So, my boss comes to me in the morning, tells me what site I'm going to, and then tells me he has a new guy to help me. We're barely keeping up to the schedule, and just lost a guy who was stabbed because his brother was involved in a gang. And then he tells me ""Hey, I need you not to start anything. This guy is a white supremacist, but we need another guy or we're not going to finish. Just try to keep it professional."" And, since my ability to eat and pay rent was ultimately dependent upon us keeping up to those deadlines, I agreed.The guy was exactly what a white supremacist in a movie made by white supremacists looks like. Gym rat with a shaved head, a legit swastika tattoo, just straight out of central casting. The guy was 6'4"". I know, because he told me during coffee break. I don't remember all of the figures he shared with me - his weight, how much he could bench press, his IQ, and at one point his shoe size. He was very proud of these metrics, and was quite happy to hold up the conversation single-handed while I bit back the desperate need to say ""Wow, that's almost as big as Micheal Jordan"" to see what he did.By coffee break, of course, we had been working for 2 hours already. I had sent him up to work on the windows above the sub-roofs. It's a good test of a new guy, since you have to set up fall protection for each sub-roof, and the safety guy polices that so I don't have to check on the guy myself - as noted, we were behind, so I wanted to get some work done myself. It's a pretty big job, so I was impressed when he told me he was nearly done. Not as impressed as I was by his ability to provide detailed metrics for his own athletic performance, but at least the guy could paint. So, I gave him some ladder work to do out back.Not ten minutes later, he comes back. ""I need to go. I hurt my leg."" He's standing there. Well, the guy already got a lot done for the two hours he was here, and it's not like I can stop him from leaving. Nor would I try. Still, I was curious. ""What happened?""""I fell off my ladder.""""Oh, shit, are you okay? You'd better report that to safety.""""I fell off the second rung. I banged my knee.""""And you can't work?""""I need to get it checked out.""""Well, okay then.""And so he left. I went to pack up the tools he was using, which was when I discovered that he had been using the wrong paint. So, I went and checked on the windows he'd painted. And yep, wrong paint there. Not that it mattered, since the reason he'd finished so quickly appeared to be that he'd just rolled all the faces and done none of the brushwork. For the entire day, the guy had done literally nothing. Less than nothing, since I had to clean up his tools.My boss gave him another chance. It ended with our rented boom lift leaking hydraulic fluid all over the road (I honestly don't know how that could have been his fault, but it feels like maybe he's just karmically a screw-up.) He got nothing done that day either. When he showed up to pick up his check, it was with his posse, led by his brother - a slightly larger, slightly beefier clone of him. The other two were a weaselly little guy who looked like an uncharismatic version of Big Joel, and that guy's girlfriend, who I later learned kind of dated whichever one of the three had the most money at the time, but slept with all of them. Which, go queen, I guess. Make that ratio work for you!So, there it is. My brush with white supremacy. I guess the takeaway from this, if there is one, should be that underneath all the politics and the violence and the ideology, these people really are deeply pathetic losers.",4626,880,0.992,0.061,0.823,0.116

However, my mother is Jewish, and I was bar mitzvahed, so by Jewish law I do qualify as one of the tribe. Also, though the large majority of my mother's family was already in America before the holocaust, I do have a great uncle that lived through Kristallnacht. So, I'm not trying to be insensitive about that.  At this point in my life though, the fact that a large corporation did something very stupid, and/or antisemitic doesn't come as much of a shock to me. However, I grew up on fast food, and have basically had a shitty diet for the whole of my life. I also worked in fast food as a teenager. So, I am curious what ""tender cheese with chicken"" is.  None of the coverage I've seen, shows any images of it. Is that a dish? Or is ""tender cheese"" just German for melted cheese, and they're just pushing the cheese as an upgrade?

292,VaushV,"Typical Floridian Political Discourse As a South Floridian, I would like you all to share in the misery that is a typical political discussion with average ""moderate"" Floridians. Keep in mind that these are college educated people who identify as ""independent"" or ""moderate conservatives."" They've finally admitted Trump is bad, but they've firmly latched onto thinking Desantis is their new messiah, as well as blaming Biden for the economy, and claiming the woke left has gone too far with CRT and LGBT indoctrination in schools.The following exchanges are only slightly abridged and simplified, but the overall intent and flow of discourse is maintained to the best of my ability. I know these sound like totally made up conversations, parodies of conservatives. Blatant straw-men meant to make my position sound good against things so outlandish that no one actually believes them. But I assure you these are actual conversations that happened within days/weeks of each other. I only wish I made them up.**DISCUSSION 1 (with a ""moderate conservative""):****Coworker:** I love DeSantis. I hope he's our next President.**Me:** Isn't it at least a little bit concerning that he refused to disown or disavow literal Nazis who flew Nazi and SS flags alongside a DeSantis flag in his own state?**Coworker:** Why should he have to say anything about it?**Me:** Why should a politician have to say that he doesn't support literal Nazis? There was kind of a war about it. Most of the world joined in. You'd think this would be the easiest slam dunk in the world. ""Nazis are bad."" So why wouldn't he say Nazis are bad and he doesn't support them or want their endorsement? Either he agrees with them, or he knows disowning or disavowing them would cost him votes from Nazis or Nazi sympathizers.**Coworker:** It's just a few people. Politicians don't like to be in the news or surrounded in controversy.**Me:** Ron DeSantis doesn't like to be in the news or to be at the center of controversy? All he does is engage in controversial culture war issues, and he's clearly building his brand for a 2024 Presidential Run.**Coworker:** Nazis aren't a real problem today. How many Nazis and white supremacists do you actually think there are in the US?**Me:** Enough are in law enforcement that the FBI have been saying it's a problem for well over a decade now.**Coworker:** I don't know man, I just don't think it's that big of a deal, so he doesn't need to say anything. You're making a big deal about nothing. The economy is much more important than a few Nazis. The craziness the liberals are teaching in schools is more important and more dangerous than a few Nazis.**DISCUSSION 2 (with an ""independent"" who voted  for DeSantis):****Coworker:** Why do you think there wasn't the red wave that was predicted?**Me:** Lots of young voters voted blue. A lot of people are worried about the rise of the Evangelical Right and Christian Nationalism, so that's probably part of it.**Coworker:** The Republicans have always been like that.**Me:** That's a little concerning, no? Wanting theocratic law, to deprive groups of people of basic human rights in the name of religion? That so many people support something that you admit is this way and always has been this way is not good, right?**Coworker:** Well, I think the economy was more important to a lot of voters. Things like abortion and LGBT rights only impact a small percent of people while the economy impacts everyone (note: Coworker was one of these voters).**Me:** How far are you willing to take this? What percent of people would you have to strip of human rights in exchange for promises to improve the economy, and how heinous would the deprivation of rights have to be before you said ""no, that's too far. I can't vote for you.""**Coworker:** Everyone sets the line somewhere different. I can't say what's right or wrong.**Me:** Sure. But there has to be some line at which we can agree is too far, even if it's only a small portion of the people whose rights are being stripped away, and even if we have to use a really extreme example to say ""that's clearly over the line."" There's more LGBT people than Jewish people in the US. Would you say it's morally justifiable to support a Nazi candidate who promises to fix the economy but only if they commit a genocide on all the Jewish people in America? Or put all the Jewish people in ghettos?**Coworker:** No one is trying to kill the Jews in America. Come on.**Me:** It's a thought exercise. I'm trying to see if you'll acknowledge that the most obvious example of going too far is, in fact, going too far.**Coworker:** It's their opinion. In their opinion, it's right. If that's what the people vote for, it's what they think is right.**Me:** So if the majority of people want something, anything, it must inherently be the right thing, and should be done?**Coworker:** Yes. I may think it's a bad or wrong thing, but that's how America works. We do what the people vote for and what the politicians we elect pass into law.**Me:** So Nazi Germany was right? The Holocaust was right? You can say that Germany THOUGHT it was right at the time, but we can now say that it was, in fact, WRONG to genocide millions of people.**Coworker:** That's your opinion. I of course also think it's wrong, but every person and culture thinks different things are right and wrong.**Me:** So slavery wasn't wrong, because people thought it was right at the time? Well, at least the slave owners thought it was right. I'm pretty sure the slaves didn't think it was right.**Coworker:** Of course I think it was bad. But slavery was ok at the time, so it was right at the time.**Me:** They thought it was ok at the time, but we can look back and say it was wrong to own humans and rape slaves.**Coworker:** But it was legal at the time.**Me:** Legal doesn't always mean right. America was kind of founded on a revolution resulting from not wanting to follow unjust and tyrannical laws. We fought a war over it and everything.**Coworker:** Not really, but whatever.**Me:** Anyway, I think anyone who wants to deprive entire groups of people of basic human rights on the grounds of their religious beliefs is doing something bad.**Coworker:** That's just your opinion. You have to respect other peoples' opinions. You just want everyone to think the way you do.**Me:** No, I don't care what anyone thinks or how anyone lives. I only care when they try to tell other people that they have to live the way they want.**Note:** There was a tangent about the paradox of tolerance here, after explaining what that means, but coworker said we should only talk about politics, not philosophy, so that went nowhere.**Coworker:** I don't really see the difference. But you have to respect other peoples' opinions. Murder, rape, and slavery being wrong are just your opinions. Being a Nazi or pro-slavery are wrong to you, but that's just your opinion. Some people think they're good things. I of course think they're really bad, but that's just my opinion.**Me:** And some people are wrong, and some people are actually bad people.**Coworker:** You can't say someone is a bad person for having a different opinion than you.**Me:** If their opinion is that there should be another Holocaust, or that we should bring back slavery, or that LGBT people should have basic rights taken away based on religious beliefs, I most certainly can. And if they act on these opinions, and try to enforce them as laws, I absolutely can.**Coworker:** What Constitutional rights do Republicans want to take away from LGBT people? Marriage isn't a Constitutional right, and gays only recently got that right.**Me:** Being allowed to drive also isn't a constitutional right. Does that mean it's not bad to pass a law that says gay people aren't allowed to drive?**Coworker:** That's silly. Nobody wants to do that.**Me:** I never said people did. But it logically follows your claim that it's not bad to take away non-constitutionally granted rights from groups of people.**Coworker:** If that's what the people vote for, it's what the people want. That's how America works. I may think it's wrong, but that's just my opinion.**Me:** I think it's wrong to deprive people of rights based on religious beliefs, even if the majority of people want to do it. You're arguing that might inherently makes right. That anything the majority of people vote for is right. That anything that is legal is right.**Coworker:** You just have to respect other peoples' opinions. No one is a bad person for having a different opinion than you.**Other reading:** There's also a third coworker who thinks that fast food shouldn't pay close to a living wage because it's only meant for high school and college kids, despite him regularly eating at fast food restaurants at lunch. He also thinks racism isn't a problem in America because we elected a black President. He also identifies as a ""moderate conservative."" He also had $500k in PPP loans forgiven, but says it's irresponsible for student loan forgiveness to happen because inflation is too high right now.",9094,1542,-0.9989,0.148,0.751,0.101

Georgia I know looks to be along racial lines but still it's mind boggling there's people smart enough to vote for Warnock and Evers, but also choosing Kemp and Ron fucking Johnson. Red state Dems should model after Tim Ryan, lost but ran a good campaign that drove turnoutSome thing also to remember is that even though certain statewide candidates lost, they still drove turnout downballot. Abrams and even Beto are good for that.**strategy going forward**Pennsylvania and Michigan state parties should advise other state parties, they've done a phenomenal job in rebuilding their infrastructure and gaining back legislative power.Also if the Dems hold both houses again, Biden really needs to go use this as a mandate to do some strong legislation in the next 12 months.

Now of course, is not the time to relax, for there is still much work to be done to save or at least salvage Democracy in America. The MAGA movement is still strong, even if Donald Trump has been moved aside as the leader. DeSantis perhaps is more of a threat than Donald Trump may ever have. He is largely in favor of the same points trump is, but without as much foulmouthed blatancy to his agenda. So, what is to be done? With Harper v Moore on the horizon, and runoffs still in play, now is the time for great action to be taken to contain and chip away at the MAGA movements popularity. How best to go about this? Well, we can‚Äôt do it alone that‚Äôs for sure.Forgive me for sounding LARP-y, but the answer is a United Front of all movements opposed to the growing Pseudo-Fascist sentiments which have all but subsumed the Republican Party. This United Front must be composed of ALL Movements opposed to MAGA-ism, be they Left, Right, or even Centrist. Anyone, from Antifa to Forward, and from there to those Libertarian Parties not taken over by fascists in disguise. We can‚Äôt let Democracy fall because we are too busy criticizing the Democrats for not going far-enough to protect Workers Rights and defend democracy. If this is truly the endgame, anyone and everyone who recognizes MAGA-ism for what it truly is must be united under a single movement to oppose it, even if it means working with those who are against certain things we support.If they are not against us, they are for us. If they are against Trump and DeSantis, they are for us. Democrats, RINOs, Antifa, Bernie Bros, Yang Gangers, Libertarians, Greens, all must stand together as one if we are to truly form an effective defense against Fascism in our country. The time for our bickering is over and the time for unified action is here. Even if the alliance is temporary, the costs of not doing so are too high to not at least try.Anyways, I typed this up in 5 minutes cause I'm not content to leave for canada and watch my Home Country become something it's not. Even if it would only be temporary. ""Temporary"" Can be for a long time, Fascism is surprisingly malleable and more resillient than we give it credit for, (See: Francoist Spain).

On the gubernatoral and senate level, the Democrats currently don't look that good.So I was interested in looking up how they are doing in local races.The Nevada assembly (similar to the House of Representatives) has 42 seats. Previously the Democrats held 26 seats, while Republicans held 16. The term was 2 years, so all seats were re-elected.This appears to be the main reporting of all election resultsBased on what I counted myself on paper Democrats are currently leading or have already won 26 seats, while Republicans currently lead or have won in 16 seats. Currently, depending on the seats counting is between 50-80% (2-3 Republicans were elected unopposed).The Nevada Senate has 21 seats (4 year terms). Every 2 years, half of the Senate is re-elected. Before Dems held 11 seats and Republicans 9 (one seats remained vacant).If I understood it correctly (and remember these aren't the full results), the Dems should hold 12 seats, while the Republicans remain on 8. The additional seat was a vacancy in Senate district 13, left by a Democrat who moved. In addition District 8 flipped to the Republicans, while Democrats are currently leading an open seat in District 12, where the Republican incumbent was limited by term-limits.I honestly just looked up the current members on Wikipedia. So if I got anything on the election wrong, please comment it, so I can learn.A large number of more moderate staffers resigned last year, so is this just mostly progressives holding the state on Assembly and Senate level, or have moderates retaken control more recently?",1731,286,0.9099,0.025,0.907,0.068

The director of the game states that narratively having a diverse cast of different ethnicities would be too divisive to include in their setting of the game since it's inspired by medieval Europe.Personally, I thought his answer was dumb because besides like 2 maybe 3 characters, Final Fantasy has been exclusively white and the black characters were either a stereotype or weren't even memorable. Any form of diversity would be in a portrayal of a monster or anthropomorphic race of people and maybe one or two of them would join the main party.However, I do respect his teams creative freedom of how they want to portray the 6 different countries in the game.  It also might be for the best to make the cast exclusively white because they already have a bad track record in writing compelling black characters except for Barret.",1008,172,0.968,0.071,0.756,0.173

458,VaushV,"Prediction based on the midterms - In 2024 the GOP will have a huge Trump problem So a good amount of the midterm results are in, and democrats had a pretty good night. But I think if there's one takeaway from them, it's not that the GOP as a party did poorly, it's that the Trump endorsement seemed to be more of a curse.Most of the big Trump endorsed candidates in competitive underperformed, some even on the same ballot as non-Trump endorsed GOP candidates like Kemp and Walker in Georgia, with Kemp doing far better than Walker.  And then you even have hardcore Trump candidates in non-competitive districts, like Boebert, that might lose...and that's shocking honestly.Meanwhile, DeSantis, a previous Trump-sycophant turned Trump rival, dominated his election.  I think GOP voters are going to realize that Trump or being associated with Trump is a detriment in general elections.  And this might actually make Trump lose the primary.And IF Trump loses the primary, the GOP presidential election is lost.  The reason I say this is that Trump will never just go quietly into that good night.  He is way too much of a narcissist.  He will say the primary was stolen, he will rally his brain-dead followers to not vote for whoever won the primary, and he may even run as an independent.The point is, he will sabotage the GOP's general for his own ego if he loses the primary.

461,VaushV,"Moore v Harper - A Monster the Republicans can't Control and Possible Strategies if the Supreme Court Supports the ""Independent State Legislature"" America's systems are broken. The Republican Supreme Court is continuing to interpret the Constitution in a way that benefits their conservative allies. But the ideology of the system could backfire on them.Before we start. The independent state legislature theory succeeding is not a good thing. I want to stress this. Its possible success is not a good thing, but there might be ways to use it for a leftist cause.These ideas and recommendations build on the assumption that Moore v Harper leads to the Supreme court supporting even more independence for state legislatures. Understanding this will likely allow many very conservative and Republican run states to gerrymander a large number of states, but it might also give more power to a few allies. If this actually happens, we need a plan for how to responsibly use this power and use it to change a larger number of minds.I want to talk about how we could achieve voting reform in more decentralized America. Many of the suggestions aren't directly left-wing, but might allow the creation of left-wing organizations in the future.**My recommendations and possible tactics build on 3 types of states/areas:****Type a)****A standard Republican state.**This will be the hardest area to succeed in. Republican legislatures will make it almost impossible to win an election as a democrat or leftist. The main focus has to lie on the few counties that vote for democrats. There are often somewhat independent cities.I've looked at Lawrence, Kansas, for example. It and a few other towns form Douglas county. A county that voted 69% for Biden (less than 30% for Trump). In this county, democrats are basically guaranteed to win any race. There are probably exceptions for the more rural townships.It seems like it is possible to achieve things like voter reform, but also the creation of political parties or at least groups that serve the same purpose as parties on the local or county level.I want to be honest. I do not know if it is technically possible to do it, but I would guess that there mostly are no state rules on ""Can this county allow more political parties to be created, after they just introduced a voter system that allows this"".Of my limited research, many city councils in the U.S. aren't that organized in their city government and often outsource committees. Sometimes there are very small city commissions. Try to learn how government is organized in your city. If it's possible, try to run as a democrat and signal your support for voting reform. It might be possible to introduce a form of proportional representation (If it was on me, I would favor an open-list proportional representation system, like in Denmark, instead of STV).**Type b)****A standard Democratic state.**Giving state legislatures more control on state-elections will also affect Democratic lead states. In these cases, we need to both get democratic candidates supporting statewide voter reform and work on referendum proposals. Most of these states are on the northern East Coast (New York, Vermont) and the West Coast (California, Washington).Democrats could use gerrymandering to insure control over blue states, but we need to be the voice of voting reform. There need to be organized parts of the Democratic Party supporting plans for proportional representation on the local and state level. I recommend especially looking at local German state elections which use much fairer election systems than the U.S., but also exist in a system with local, county and state level. There might also be other countries that we are able to learn of.I want to see Americans being jealous of the states that are blue today, but that might introduce electoral reform in the next 10 to 20 years. To get to that point, we need to work within the Democratic Party and maybe add the support of smaller movements (like the Working Families Party). Should a state changes to a fairer system for state legislatures, we need to make it easier to form new parties that are able to run, without taking votes away from the Democrats. When this ever happens, we need to continue smart coalitions. Even if a state allows for leftist parties being an option, these parties might still need to ally with democrats for races on local or federal levels. It is important to prevent vote splitting, but also show strenght and representation. While actually being right-leaning, it makes sense in my opinion to look at the Australian coalition, which unites more moderate and right-leaning parties, while insuring independence for its members. There is hopefully a point, when leftist parties that are strong in states or regions, might be able to create coalition agreements with democrats.**Type C)****The weird states**This category is one that is hard to define. ""Weird states"" are states that trend to not have the traditional democrats vs republicans politics. My prime example is Alaska. In the Alaska State House, Independents and Republicans caucus with the Democrats, while in the State Senate, a Democrat caucuses with the Republicans.While Alaska is not going Democratic soon, but it still has very, very unusual politics. In 2014, Democrats teamed up with an Independent to beat the incumbent Republican. In 1990 a third party candidate won, but later joined the Republicans. Coalitions in the state are weird. Despite being heavily pro-Republican, Alaska has also implemented voter reform.There might have to be VERY weird alliances, that might actually work for some reasons, depending on the region. If it is possible to convince moderate Republicans to form coalitions for policies that will increase the number of options represented in parliament.**Why I believe this is important**These were some broad suggestions. They might be overly positive. But even in the worst case of Republicans being allowed by the Supreme Court to gerrymander, we need to talk about how to work in a new environment. There have always been and there are at this point, laws that have made our democracy more unfair. We need to see it from the political side and use the remaining tools and new tools to our favor, even if some of these tools were created against us.If you aren't in direct danger, look up what you are able to do in your local area and state. There are many different ways to help. I have tried to list some, but there are many others and these suggestions might not even apply to your situation. A better world is always possible, even if the odds are against us.And remember what we stand for. We need to start governing on our values. Our values deserve to be used for positive change.,JT",6772,1120,0.9995,0.037,0.798,0.165

466,VaushV,An explanation of why Florida is no longer a swing state 1.) I lived in Florida for just under two decades of my life. Since the 2020 election and the pandemic tens of thousands of people flocked to Florida to retire a vast majority of these people loved DeSantis and hated lockdowns. In the lead up to the primaries most of these people being retired and with money have the time and energy to spend doing things like door to door campaigns etc. By 2022 the state Florida republican party had set itself up for tremendous growth. Democrats on the other hand are bleeding votes. Not becuase there are Democrats voting Republican in the state. But rather the large Democrat bloc of young people who cannot afford to live in Florida moved to other more affordable states. Thus this is creating a scenario where Florida despite being a swing state in the past is now in my OPINION a favorable red state from here onward.,917,165,0.9052,0.024,0.868,0.107

474,VaushV,"An overview of some of the Wins and Losses of the Election. Democrats defied political gravity to absolutely smash out a midterm. Of course early on, as predicted Florida fucked Democrats hard..But Democrats in most other states come out swinging and scored some serious wins.**Florida** L - Florida DemocratsW - Florida RepublicansFlorida is a hell mouth. A cursed land inhabited by demons. Florida Democrats just absolutely collapsed here. DeSantis rigged the whole state with an insane gerrymander (that because of Republicans' massive overperformance is kinda a dummymander and sort of limited how high they could have gone). Democrats got majorly outspent, Qanon and other insanity has taken over Florida Latin American emigree communities, just utterly bleak.[Rubio won 57.7% to Val Demmings 41.3% at the time of this post. ](DeSantis won 59.4% to Crist's 40% at the time of this post.This is in a year, where the national popular vote is likely 2-3 +D after accounting for uncontested races. Florida is a red state. If you live in Florida, just leave. The state is a cursed land, and it's going to be underwater. Just move. Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, New Hampshire, PA, MI, WI, just any swing state. There are just too many insane right-wing Latin American exiles, too many Fox News-addled retirees, and too many hard-core conservatives leaving other states to escape 'covid' tyranny and moving to Florida. But the reason it is worth mentioning is it could be a major secret L for Trump. Florida Republicans are essentially the only ones who can claim to have a rock-solid victory. Led by DeSantis, who now with this victory under his belt. While Trump looming over this election can be used to claim that Trump cost them seats. This could be the start of a Republican Civil war.**New York**W - New York Republicans, Cuomo. L - New York Democrats, the House Majority possibly. If Republicans still win a House Majority, the fault is down to New York. New York Judges, a conservative body made up of Cuomo appointees struck down the Democratic gerrymander, drawn to counter GOP gerrymanders in other states. They didn't do this out of a sincere anti-gerrymandering stance, since they allowed the previous State Senate maps to stand, which were gerrymandered in the Republicans' favour. New York Democrats were also either asleep at the wheel, or actively aiding the GOP. New York Governor Kathy Hochul,, at the time of this post, is only winning by a bit over 5 points, in New York, against a pro-insurrectionist former House member. That margin will grow, since its waiting on Mail-in ballots. But it is far closer than New York should be. New York's Mayor, Eric Adams (who was a former Republican), was basically helping Republicans, both by running New York terribly and creating non-stop scandals, going to every media source, and nonstop talking about out-of-control crime in New York, despite the city being very safe relative to the rest of America. Basically doing the New York Post's job for them. Republicans because of this, are on track to flip multiple seats in New York. Given how thin the House margins are, these New York seats could very well be the difference between a Democratic and Republican majority. If you are in New York, you need to join the Democratic Party and take it over. And kick out Eric Adams when he is up for reelection. Now lets talk nationally.**Senate**Democrats have almost certainly maintained control of the Senate. They have already flipped the Pennsylvania, Senate seat. The current breakdown is 48 Democratic Seats to 47 Republican seats. Of them, from most to least Democratic. **Georgia** - Warnock leads in Georgia. Based on the remaining ballots, Walker has no hope of getting past him, it's only a question of does Warnock makes it to 50% and avoids a runoff, or does a runoff happen? In a state without a runoff system, you could call this now for Warnock.If it does go to a runoff, as is fairly likely, Walker very likely loses. Walker was pushed up by stronger performing Republicans on the ticket, like Governor Kemp was who reelected. Now he is alone on the ballot, with all the focus on his wife beating, abortion paying, brain damaged and extreme positions. I would call this Likely D. (49D)**Arizona** currently stands at Lean Democratic. Mark Kelly leads Peter Thiel's court jester and fascist creep, Blake Masters. The remaining vote is Republican-leaning, but Blake Masters is underperforming his bench marks. I'd peg this as Lean to Likely D (50D, which is a majority with the VP tiebreaker).**Nevada** is listed as a tossup by most election watchers. However Ralston, the Nevada expert is saying its tilts CCM the Democratic candidate. The votes remaining are either rural (Republican) and mail in (Democratic). (51D. Which means Democrats could loss either Manchin or Sinema on a vote).**Wisconsin** is listed as likely R, by most election watchers. However, they can't call it, as there are quite a lot of votes left to count in heavily Democratic Milwaukee. Likely the incumbent Ron Johnson will hang on. But if he doesn't Barnes, would make it  52D.**Alaska** isn't going to be won by Democrats. However, the contest is between moderate Republican Lisa Murkowski and a MAGA crazy. Democrats didn''t seriously try and contest Alaska's senate seat, to help Murkowski. So Democrats look to hold the Senate. Republicans would need a lot of lucky breaks, to win all but one of these races. **The House** Republican gerrymandering for the most part worked. Democrats look to narrowly lose the House. However, it hasn't been called, so Democrats still have a path to a narrow Democratic majority. However, the average projection of Republican seats after the election, looks to be only about 224 and it could fall lower, as California votes come in. Note that a House majority is 218, so Republicans are looking at a margin of error of less then ten seats.Now Nancy Pelosi managed to do a lot with an even smaller House majority. But Kevin McCarthy isn't Nancy Pelosi and is widely considered an idiot and moron. And smarter Republicans, have been fucked over, with bigger majorities.John Boehner, who had a massive majority after 2014, still ended up rage-quitting and saying that a massive part of his party, were 'assholes, terrorists and anarchists"". So key areas to highlight. Tim Ryan may have lost, but he helped carry Ohio Democrats to 5 House seats. Ohio Democrats were widely considered to only be in the running for 2-3 seats, due to extreme GOP gerrymandering. Gerrymandering which was struck down by the Ohio supreme court ... and then the state legislature just ignored it. But Ohio Democrats despite losing statewide, managed to overcome the gerrymander and win 5. In North Carolina, Cheri Beasly also lost, but she helped get Democrats to 7 of the 14 House seats in the State. **Governors and State Legislatures** Democrats have already gained Trifectas in Maryland and Massachusetts, by gaining the governor's office, and in Minnesota by gaining the State Senate. That means that in all three states, Democrats now can legislate freely without Republican opposition. The first two aren't earth-shattering, as Democrats could override the GOP Governors vetos anyway with their legislatures, if all agreed. But Democrats have gone without control of Minnesota since they lost control of a chamber in 2014. All three of these states can now start passing progressive legislation, and governing without GOP sabotage.Also in the running are Michigan and Pennsylvania. Democrats have already been called as retaining both Governor offices, defeating extremist Republicans. But in addition, they have also flipped one state legislature in Michigan the State Senate.In Michigan, Democrats' projections also means they will get the State House. Which would make a full trifecta. PA they are close to grabbing both the State House and Senate. One election watcher, who is a expert in state legislatures, says it is Lean D. So in total, Democrats are in the running to gain 5 Trifectas. On defence, the only trifecta they might lose is Nevada Governor, as the Republican is performing a bit better there, and Oregon. Democrats in Governor races have held up incredibly well. They won massively in Maine, they held the line against an election denier in Wisconsin, and they flattened extremist Republicans in Michigan and Pennsylvania. They retained New Mexico, and they are narrowly leading Republicans to keep the Governor of Kansas. There is a possibility that they don't lose any Governor race where they held the seat. The open questions are in Arizona, where Katie Hobbs is running behind Mark Kelly. Kari Lake is an insane election denier. Winning Arizona is very big. Then the aforementioned Nevada, Oregon and Kansas. On the offensive Democrats did a bit weaker. They flopped vs Brian Kemp in Georgia. Beto did okay, doing better than the 2018 Governor nominee in 2018 (but way worse than against Cruz). And in Oklahoma, despite a major overperformance, Democrats failed to unseat Kevin Stitt, despite all the damage he did to his state, and his deep unpopularity, due to wrecking the state's schools with budget cuts and charter schools. **Ballot Measures**Tens of thousands of people in South Dakota will now get Healthcare, as the state voted to expand Medicaid, an Obamacare measure that the Supreme Court decided was up to states to opt into. The deal is the federal government pays for 90% of those in between the old and new line, and the state pays 10%. Pretty good deal right? Yeah not if you are a Republican. They'd rather let their voters die, than~~ expand Obamacare~~ pay 10%. So to get around the Republican state legislature and Governor, the state organised and passed a ballot measure. Leaving just 11 of the 50 states yet to expand Medicaid. This continues the winning streak of Medicaid expansion always winning, if it makes the ballot. Voters in California, Michigan, and Vermont on Tuesday adopted constitutional amendments that enshrine abortion rights into their state constitutions. &gt;Kentuckyians were similarly voting on Tuesday on a constitutional amendment that would have declared that their state constitution does not protect abortion rights, and just like Kansas they rejected the measure. &gt;Montana decided yet another measure pertaining to abortion on Tuesday. Unlike the other referendums, this concerned a state statute that required medical care be given to any infant ‚Äúborn alive‚Äù after induced labor, cesarean sections, or attempted abortions. The bill was drafted to mirror model legislation advanced by national anti-abortion groups, and was condemned by abortion-rights advocates and abortion providers as addressing a non-existent problem‚Äîespecially given the rarity of late-term abortions generally. The measure appeared to be failing on Tuesday night, but regardless would likely have little impact on the legality and availability of abortion in Montana.In terms of weed, there was a split. In Maryland and Missouri voters went for legislation. However, Arkansas South Dakota and North Dakota voted against legalising weed. There is way more ballots and races left, so not everything above is final. But overall its a massive win, particularly compared to 2010 or 2014.",11316,1846,0.9871,0.088,0.811,0.101

They are a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the New Deal. They are the Carrion Lords of America for whom millions of voots are sacrificed every four years so that they may never truly die.Yet even in their deathless state, the Democrats continue their eternal vigilance. Mighty Trans people cross the daemon-infested miasma of the deep south, their way lit by HRT, the psychic manifestation of the Trans people's will.

If someone is unsure of a race or you think they may be swayable, help them find some information on it. Don't go full debate lord, but try and put pressure where you think it will work. Use the right arguments on the right people, not everybody is progressive, so they might need different arguments. Some links that may helpEach state will have various voter guides, just make sure it's one from a Group of progressives, and not Republicans, church groups, NIMBYs or other bad types trying to trick voters.Be aware that ballots in many states will have both partisan races, and 'non-partisan' races (that still might be partisan contests). Lower-level officials and judges can still be incredibly powerful. State Supreme Courts are incredibly powerful and can allow or block gerrymanders. A big reason why Democrats even have their narrow house control is that they won State Supreme Court offices, which struck down Republican gerrymanders in multiple states. As well as rule on a host of legal issues. Make sure to research the ballots. There will be lots of various ballot measures many of which will be deliberately confusing. There are big things on the ballot as well. The fate of healthcare for tens of Thousands, in South Dakota's Medicaid expansion vote. The reproductive rights of millions, in multiple states. Weed is on the ballot in multiple states. As is many criminal justice measures. Minimum wages. etcIf you are watching the live coverage some things to note.**Don't overdose on the early votes.** Some states will start off very blue and some states will start off really red. Different states have different methods of counting. Some will tend to count their rural votes extremely quickly, and then votes from urban areas will trickle in. Some states won't start counting mail-in ballots until the polls close (a law that Republicans in multiple state legislatures backed to help Trump cry fraud). That leads to red mirages, like what happened in 2020.Alternatively, some states pre-count mail-in ballots and count their cities fast. So for example Ohio could look insanely good for Democrats. At first. Then their lead will diminish fast. That also happened in 2020.**Florida will also likely be a bad sign.** They are a big state, their polls close super early, and they count very fast, due to their election laws. While Republicans this year have massively outspent Democrats, there are very few competitive races due to gerrymandering, and DeSantis has scared off a lot of voters with his 'voter fraud' arrests. Florida is also full of old Republican retirees who vote in every election, while Democrats are dependent on a lot of variable voters who often don't show up for elections. In 2020, all the doom narratives basically started as Florida started reporting. Florida will most likely be bad. But Florida also isn't really representative of the wider US. The signs that Biden was going to win, were already showing as Indionpolis suburbs reported, but people stopped paying attention to those, as Miami swung to Trump. **Don't Trust Twitter**. Elon Musk has fired most of Twitter's work staff, he is rolling out an all-new verification system, and traffic to Twitter is going to spike hard. The Chans and other right-wing sites will be organising raids as well, and now there are few if any content moderators. And Elon wants to encourage the trolls and has endorsed Republicans. So the best bet is to be highly sceptical of stuff you see on Twitter. **Be careful at the polls**. If a group tries fucking around at the polls, like the Arizona ballot watchers, there are tiplines manned by election lawyers who can bring the hammer down hard. If you see something, speak up, or call the professionals. Don't let them get away with crimes. **It could be a very long night.** With the House and Senate so close, majority control of either chamber could have to wait for the West Coast, or counting every ballot. The West Coast states allow mail-in ballots that are postmarked, to arrive for days after the election. (If you are voting that method tho, you should take it to a dropbox to make sure it gets counted). If it gets hyper-close, then it could even come down to Alaska's House seats, ranked-choice voting which took weeks to count then call..The Senate could also come down to a runoff. Georgia is one of the most competitive races, between incumbent Raphael Warnock a Democratic Senator, the pastor of MLK's former church, and a progressive. And Herschel Walker a brain-damaged footballer, who just loves paying for abortions, beating his wife, and repeatably saying he has now been saved by Christ, and that's why people who do abortions should be locked up. Yeah its Georgia, so it's likely still close.They have a system where if neither candidate gets over 50%, then it goes to a runoff. So Senate control like in 2020, could come down to a runoff.",5079,860,0.9872,0.084,0.798,0.118

Some of whom were just creators I've followed for a long time because they made pro black content, just fucking buying into this Jewish conspiracy nonsense hook line and sinker. 1)Kyrie Irving did not get shitcanned for posting a link. He got shitcanned for posting a link, heavily implying that he agreed with the content, doubling down, refusing to disavow the blatantly antisemitic  content, dogwhistling to high heaven and generally just being a cunt.  The ""Amazon is responsible"" argument is bullshit. Amazon has both Birth of a Nation and Mein Kampf as well. There's a difference between putting that up there for research purposes, and posting it on your instagram with the heavy implication that it's  ""the truth"" and refusing to explain yourself. THAT is why he deserves everything that's getting to him. 2)Black Hebrew Israelites are dangerous. Really dangerous.  These people have and will continue to commit violence.   One of them shot MLKs mother for fucks sake.  They are relentless at street preaching, proselytizing and online trolling and making themselves seem greater in number than they actually are is extremely effective.  Yes they might not have that many members but that's not their goal. Their goal is to propagate their rhetoric to people in desperate conditions and if you were to count the people who buy into some of their more fucked up beliefs I think it would be a much scarier number.

I believe that the mixed economy and the welfare state is the best humanity has done thus far, and likely be the best we can do for a long time in the future. However, unlike liberals I do not hold private property to be a right on the same level as rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, for example. I believe that private enterprises must justify themselves through social utility and benefit to society. As such, I am open to further socialization of the economy when automation and other technological advances render private property in a sector superfluous. I am not ideologically opposed to private property, I think there will always be some private sector of the economy, even if it becomes smaller.  I don't believe in LTV. I believe one of the good aspects of capitalism is the flexibility of capital investment. Markets are good, but not perfect, and requires regulation and that there should decommodification some vital services, such as healthcare and education. Immediately I support the expansion of the wealth state and social programs, and the strengthening and institutionalizing of the labor unions. I'd support the establishment of a social wealth fund to help fund things like retirement and a UBI/citizen's dividend. I'd nationalize some industries, and support incentives for worker cooperatives (though to be honest, I am not married to coops). I consider myself pragmatic, reformist, and evolutionist. I do not know what a future socialism looks like, and don't believe anyone who claims to have a working model for the future that society is supposed to conform to. I don't believe in final goals or end points of history, there will always be change, such as technological development, cultural change, and ecological change. I do not support arbitrary or dogmatic nationalizations or mandatory coops if it produces worse outcomes, socialization must make sense and be beneficial, it must economically make sense. That said, technology will likely justify more socializations in the future. As many of you know, but some don't., social democracy comes from the reformist wing of 20th century socialism, though it unfortunately moved in the center starting in the 1980s, I believe in a left wing social democratic revival. I consider myself to be a strong internationalist, I believe in promoting freedom, human rights, and democracy around the world, and supporting peoples in their struggles. I believe in international cooperation to deal with crises like climate change, war, natural disasters, and poverty. I believe in international law and norms, and in institutions like the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. In the future, when democracy and freedom prevail in most countries I would support developments towards a type of weak world federalism. I guess I am a ""statist"", since I believe a democratic state should exist forever.",3019,491,0.9969,0.067,0.735,0.198

I feel like they're still stuck in the 2008 - 2020 mindset, when they were disillusioned by the Democratic Party  Obama and there was still a chance to elect a leftist (Bernie). But that time is gone.For example, when Kyle was covering the Paul Pelosi attack, he of course condemned it, but he had to preface it by saying ""I really despite Nancy Pelosi, but she shouldn't be attacked"". Like, he can't even condemn a fascist violent attack without prefacing it by reminding the audience that he hates Democrats.There's a right time and way to criticize Democrats. I think Vaush and Pakman do a pretty good job of it. They have lots of criticisms of Democrats, but they make it clear that they're still all in for Democrats and they excite the audience to vote blue. You need to give people a reason to vote for blue, if you constantly shit on them you'll just discourage people from voting, even if you didn't intend to.

709,VaushV,"ONTARIO LABOUR DISPUTE BREAKDOWN - GENERAL STRIKE? (TL;DR) **Introduction**Ontario is set to face one of the biggest strikes in Canadian history. Premier Doug Ford has taken unprecedented action in an attempt to outlaw a worker's right to collective bargaining. Fearing a walkout by Ontario education workers, Ford's government in recent days has invoked the notwithstanding clause, essentially an article in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that allows legislatures to temporarily suspend sections of the Charter. This move was made to bind 55,000 education workers into an undemocratic contract, echoing elements of ""back-to-work"" legislation in the United States. The legislation would also fine workers $4,000 a day and the union $500,000 for striking. This would be the first time in Canadian history that a provincial or federal legislature has taken such a move in an attempt to end labour action.I know this was already talked about on this subreddit, but to link a single article is to void the necessary context and magnitude of the event. Here I'm going to try to breakdown the current labour dispute unfolding its broader context. I'll then try to answer its broader implications. This is an informative thread aimed at being a call to action for**Striker's Grievances*** CUPE has stated their workers' make an average $39,000 a year ($28,816 USD), representing the lowest paid earners in schools. CUPE's negotiation started by asking for 11.7% annual salary increases (CBC).* CUPE education workers' wages have been stagnant in comparison to other unionized sectors relating to inflation. (@VanmalaS on Twitter, Financial Post journalist \*CHART\*)* **""**More than 50% of the workers surveyed said that they work more than one job to make ends meet. 33% were sole-income earners for their households."" (@VanmalaS on Twitter)* Ford's government has stated it would not negotiate unless the strike was called off.**Ford's Rhetoric*** The justification Ford has stuck with in this dispute is that he is ""determined to keep children in school"" after they have fallen victim to lockdowns and stay-at-home orders during the pandemic.* This strawman argument echoes similar rhetoric regarding a smaller CUPE labour dispute in Newfoundland in late August. After city workers of Mount Pearl picketed across city institutions and premises, all major news outlets in the province chose the angle of the victimized children being denied the right to summertime sports after suffering prolonged lockdowns (CBC).I'm not necessarily drawing a correlation between the two, however it highlights the manipulative nature of these union-busting campaigns, often resorting to arguments designed to make the opposition appear to be unreasonable agitators instead of victims earning starvation wages.**Union Action*** CUPE (Canadian Union of Public Employees that represents the 55,000 education workers) have stated they are striking ""indefinitely"" and vowing to return to the kind of labour action from the time before legally protected strikes even existed. ""They don't know what they just started."" This will continue until the bill they passed is repealed @Alan\_S\_Hale on Twitter, journalist for Queen Park Today).* CUPE Ontario President has met with other union leaders and has stated ""We will build resistance. We will bring others to this resistance, we will keep going"" (@AhmarSKhan on Twitter, Global News journalist).*  8,000 workers from the Ontario Public Service Employees Union have called for a strike in solidarity with CUPE (Toronto City News).* 2,200 GO transit workers are set to strike on Monday as no deal with Metrolinx was met, a development independent of the CUPE strike (Global News).* University of Western Ontario Faculty Association, representing 1,800 employees may  strike on 14 November if no deal is reached with the university, also independent development of CUPE strike (Western Gazette).* United Steelworkers Union representing Pinecrest Nursing Home workers have been denied striking rights by this legislation, whether they will still go ahead in withdrawing their labour is yet to be seen (United Steelworkers).* Unifor (largest private sector union in Canada representing 310,000 workers) has pledged $100,000 to fight fees against CUPE (Unifor).* Several unions such as the Elementary Secondary Teachers' Federation, Ontario Nurses' Association, United Steel Workers, and The International Association of Fire Fighters, have all issued statements in solidarity with CUPE picketers. As of now, none of these unions have plans on striking themselves, however a few unions are picketing alongside CUPE outside working hours.**Response From Politicians*** Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued a statement expressing Ford's use of the notwithstanding clause to be ""wrong and inappropriate."" This statement appears to be the harshest rhetoric he is willing to use, as he has reiterated its ""inappropriateness"" several times. He has also issued statements in solidarity with striking workers, however no action specifically by the Liberal government has been taken (@JustinTrudeau on Twitter).* Jagmeet Singh, leader of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP), called an emergency debate in Parliament in light of this development, which was rejected by the Conservative Deputy Speaker. He has denounced the Ford government as trampling on the constitutional rights of educational workers (@theJagmeetSingh on Twitter). His motion for the federal government to stand with workers passed in the house with Liberal support. He took this time to call out the federal Conservative Party leader along with his provincial leaders as ""waging war on workers"", seizing the opportunity to also denounce the Premier of Alberta in their attempt to lower the minimum wage (@theJagmeetSingh on Twitter). His rhetoric is unmatched by any federal party leader, as he has launched legislative motions, petitions and almost all of his tweets and public appearances in recent days have been expressing his outrage and calling for workers and politicians to seek immediate action. * Pierre Poilevre, leader of the federal Conservative Party, has been silent on the ongoing labour dispute. This is not at all surprising, as he served in Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet, a notoriously anti-union legislator (Toronto Star). This should then be no surprise that his party voted against the NDP motion in standing with striking workers. He has championed worker action in the past, which was clearly nothing more than empty statements to boost his ""populist"" image.* The Provincial NDP of Ontario, currently the official opposition in the Ontario Provincial Parliament, have been fierce opponents of Ford's unprecedented actions. Debate in the legislature got extremely heated a few days ago, with screaming matches unfolding as half of NDP MPP's were ejected from the premise for unparliamentary behaviour (Toronto City News \*VIDEO\*). Unfortunately there is little the provincial NDP can do, as the Conservatives hold a majority in the house.**Implications**Many have called for the complete withdrawal of all labour in the province in response to Doug Ford's actions. A general strike is incredibly hard to predict as it appears now, however if the right to collective bargaining is completely  done away with in the province, this may force the hand of the unions to seek action. Keep in mind this a recent and ongoing development in Ontario, with more strikes set to kickstart on Monday. The rhetoric coming from CUPE leadership is that they are determined to picket for as long as necessary until Ford's legislation is repealed. If I've learned anything from studying labour action, it's that violence is a high probability in large disputes such as this. However, whether more unions will join the strike in solidarity is yet to be seen.What we can conclude from our political leadership is that the NDP remains the only voice for the working class in any legislature across the country, with Conservatives offering lies and lip service and the Liberal government weak and passive rhetoric. Liberals may be doing more than nothing in that they voted for a symbolic condemnation of Ford, but never forget the true champions of working people have always been the NDP.**Public Opinion*** When asked ""who do you blame most for schools being closed due to education worker strike?"", 62% answered ""the provincial government"" (72% for parents of younger kids) with 28% answering ""Education workers"" (Polling Canada, Abacus Data 1) This highlights the undemocratic nature of Ford's political antics, even if conservative propaganda has already rotted the brain of nearly 3/10ths of the province.* When asked ""Would you support or oppose other unions walking off the job to protest the provincial governments alongside education workers?"", 48% responded support, 34% oppose, with 18% unsure (Polling Canada, Abacus Data 2)  Considering this form of worker action could a series of public disobedience not seen in Canada in over since the 1919 Winnipeg general strike, these numbers aren't entirely worrying. What cannot be determined, however, is the direction they are prone to swing. Regardless, these numbers are succumb to change as the story develops.**How Can I Help?*** If you live in Ontario, please consider joining the picket lines with striking workers. On 12 November, Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL), CUPE and affiliates are considering a mass protest in Queens Park. Our strength is in our numbers. Keep posted on events on CUPE's website (Here)* Send Doug Ford a message or find a picket line near you (Here)* Sign NDP petition in demanding the protection of worker's constitutional rights (Here)* For those living outside Canada, educating yourself and raising awareness of the draconian measures governments will take in suppressing worker action is essential.* Share this post to raise awareness ;)**Notes**I realize many of my sources come from Twitter, most being local journalists reporting on city/provincial politics. I feel these to be reliable sources, as they are directly interviewing politicians, union leaders, activists, etc. That being said, I feel this analysis adequately describes the situation unfolding in Ontario to the best of my knowledge, however if anyone has evidence to suggest what I stated to be either misleading or incorrect, I'm more than willing to make corrections. As an honours student of Political Science, I am very passionate about labour organizing and Canadian politics so I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, even to those who merely skimmed through.**TL;DR**Due to legislation by the ""Progressive"" Conservative Party of Ontario in revoking the Canadian Charter's right to organize and collective bargain, over 65,000 workers are set to go on strike, leaving much speculation as to if other unions will join the fight against this unprecedented legislation. What is clear through all this is the NDP's vigilance in protecting worker's rights on a provincial and national scale, but to little avail. Only time will tell how this event will unfold; violence may ensue, propaganda is inevitable, but of course, our solidarity is forever.",11253,1736,-0.9942,0.108,0.813,0.079

Also, I know that Vaush isn't an anti-electoral dumbass, but some of those wash into the subreddit, and hopefully some points I make here, or links to stuff help you guys. **Background**The US Midterms are on Tuesday, the 8th of November 2022. The US House, and Senate, as well as various State Governor's races, state legislature elections and other local races like sheriffs and judges, are all on the ballot.This is the first midterm of the Biden admin, the first set of elections since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and the election that sets the stage for 2024. Trump and his Republican allies have made it clear, that they are electing a slate of candidates to help him win back power in 2024 by any means necessary.  Control of the Senate is currently split 50-50 with the VP as a tiebreaker. The Senate in addition to passing or blocking legislation also has the power to appoint judges and federal officials. The only threat to the Republican-controlled Supreme Court is a Democratic majority. If they merely maintain their current 50-50 split, they can replace a conservative judge that dies or retires. If they expand their majority, with progressives like Fetterman, Barnes, Ryan and Beasley then they could expand the court. Each has already vowed to end the filibuster as linked above. But if they lose their majority, then the Supreme Court is free of literally any oversight, and they can do far worse. Overturning Roe v Wade wasn't the end it could be the beginning. [This is the map of the Senate battleground](Control of the House is also narrowly split. 218 seats are needed for a majority, and currently, Democrats hold 220, and Republicans 212 \(with a few vacant\). The House crafts legislation and budgets. Republicans have already vowed to use a House majority, to cut off aid to Ukraine, as Republicans steadily turn on Ukraine. Republicans have also vowed to use every trick they can, to do damage to Biden before the 2024 election, including threats to take the US economy hostage, to force austerity cuts to Social Security, Medicare and other government services. This is a map of the House battlegroundThen there are a host of Governor races as well as critically important State Legislatures and Secretary of States, who are in charge of election administration. Donald Trump and his allies have made it an explicit strategy to target these with election deniers. This article explains which states have Republican election deniers running.&gt;This new Bolts guide walks through all of those 35 states, plus Washington, D.C., one by one. Voters are electing their secretary of state directly in 27 states; in another eight, the secretary of state will be selected after the election by public officials‚Äîthe governor, or lawmakers‚Äîwho are on the Nov. 8 ballot. (The 15 other states and Puerto Rico will either select theirs after the 2024 cycle or, in a few cases, don‚Äôt have a secretary of state at all.)Explaining every race would be a massive post. So check out this article, which breaks down some key races in every state. Even in very red or very blue states, there are major races with real consequences on the ballot. There are Trumpist sheriffs wielding power with an iron fist in blue areas that are now facing the ballot. There are red states where Democrats have a shot of taking power from deeply incompetent and malicious Republicans, like the very tight Oklahoma Governor race, a state that in 2020 voted for Trump by a 33% margin.There are major consequences to all these elections. LGBT rights, particularly Trans ones are on the ballot. Abortion rights are on the ballot, in electing pro or anti choice, election officials, as well as in ballot initiatives in multiple states either legalising or criminalising abortion.  Healthcare is on the ballot, particularly in South Dakota where Medicaid Expansion is on the ballot. Climate change spending, social safety net programs, the criminal justice system, etc. All up for grabs. **Why combating Fascism Matters**In Brazil, former President Lula just went up against Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is a self-avowed fascist. He has praised the brutal right-wing dictatorship of Brazil. He praised the coup in Chile by Pinochet. He has openly before the election talked about not accepting the results, and that voter fraud would steal the election.All this happening in Brazil, a country which unlike the US has had a long history of military coups, and has only again been a democracy since 1985. Bolsonaro's reign in power has been disastrous for Brazil and the world. He presided over massive deaths from COVID due to his idiocy, incompetence and anti-vaccine crankery. Political violence has ramped up. And he and his rancher allies are clear-cutting the Amazon, the lungs of the world to grow crops that strip the soil. Which includes murdering the natives and activists who live in the Amazon and stand in their way. And yet Lula is now set to take power, defeating Bolsonaro narrowly in the second round.Why? Because the US made it extremely clear to Bolsonaro that it would act against a coup. Biden's CIA director even warned Bolsonaro directly not to do a coup.But let's say we are on Earth Two. In Earth-Two, Trump won 12,000 more votes in Georgia, 11,000 more in Arizona, 21,000 in Wisconsin and 81,000 in Pennsylvania. Securing his reelection as President.Trump has of course tried his own coup, and has been very supportive of Bolsonaro's coup. And he is no stranger to interference in Latin America, with the right-wing carrying out a coup in Bolivia and attempting invasions of Venezuela, as well as trying a maximum pressure strategy against Cuba. Additionally, his CIA head isn't a diplomat like William Burns, but Gina Haspel, who ran an illegal black site carrying out torture. So on Earth two, instead of seeing Bolsonaro slink home in shame and Lula come to power, Brazil would very likely be seeing a coup in action right now. Bolsonaro's allies arresting the Brazilian Supreme Court which checked him. 'Investigations' into election irregularities. Army tanks and formations in the streets. Riot police breaking up demonstrations in Lula strongholds. Bolsonaro for years clearly thought he could withstand internal opposition to a coup. But he backed down when it was clear he would have to face opposition internally, as well as international opposition. Also on Earth Two, the Russia-Ukraine war has continued in its escalated form. Fierce fighting has continued to ravage the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv as Russia seeks to tighten the pocket around the city, while Russian forces are battling in Odesa, attempting to seize the final pieces of the Ukrainian coastline. Russia has aside from a few small pockets, secured all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper river. Horror stories of mass graves, executions and kidnappings have trickled out from behind Russian lines, but the reporting situation is confused, with Russian state media and affiliates, as well as a cross-partisan coalition of Republicans and some so-called Leftists, dispute the 'EU Line; Ukraine has fiercely resisted the full-scale onslaught of Russia's invasion, but the Russian advance, while embarrassed by many blunders has continued to push forward. Ukraine's military situation is desperate as it relies on limited military aid from Europe. However, Europe is caught between the Russian natural gas blackmail and the indifferent US. US aid to Ukraine was limited to a token package of humanitarian aid after Donald Trump successfully vetoed military aid packages crafted by Democrats and Senate Republicans, and their veto override failed in the House due to Republican votes. Zelenskyy from the relocated capital in Lviv in Western Ukraine warns that with the fresh Russian mobilisation, and major shortfalls in military gear, that the Ukrainian lines could rupture, and Russia could advance deep into central Ukraine. Unleashing fresh horrors on the millions of Ukrainians still in their country, and leaving the millions that have already escaped to Europe homeless. The EU is also under pressure internally, as far-right forces mobilise against being punished for supporting the Ukrainian lost cause, and the millions of refugees created by the conflict. Hate crimes have spiked and support for helping Ukraine has steadily fallen. Italy, Hungary and Sweden have all officially cut off aid to Ukraine, and further elections could see a number of European countries fall out of the coalition, as more far-right governments are elected.**Non-Hypotheticals**Of course, Earth-Two, is just a Hypothetical, even if I do think it is a highly accurate portrayal of what would be in the cards if Donald Trump got his second term. And could still be in the cards if he wins in 2024.But we also have real-world examples. For the last time, we had an international collection of fascists collaborating together. The Spanish Civil War saw fierce fighting between the Nationalists and Republicans. The Nationalists won, thanks to decisive support from the German and Italian fascist governments.If Germany had beaten back Nazism in the early 1930s, then the Nationalists would have had almost no hope of actually winning the war against the Republicans. The revolts by the army were beaten back in most of Spain's major cities. While Franco's elite units were stationed in Spanish North Africa. The Nationalists attempted to gain control of the Spanish navy, but their crews revolted against their officers, blockading the Army of Africa.But then German planes were used to ferry over the Nationalist Troops#Role_in_the_Spanish_Civil_War).The Nazis supplied the Condor Legion to Spain, helping to secure air superiority over the Republican Forces and bomb their cities flat. They supplied massive amounts of aid, training, and gear and encouraged the Italians to boost their own aid to Spain. As well as discouraged Western Aid to the Spanish Republicans, leaving them in the lopsided position of their enemy receiving lavish aid, while they were cut off, save for a mercenary USSR. Spain bleed because of Franco's victory, and Spanish supplies during WW2 helped the Nazi war machine in its conquests throughout Europe. As well as gave them a crucial testing ground for their tactics and weapons. It's clear, that Fascism breeds more fascism. The elections of 2022 will have consequences for not just the US, but the wider world. Not voting isn't just actively harmful to yourself. But it's saying that you, a citizen of the wealthiest country in the world, also don't care about the people of other countries, in danger from their own domestic fascists, or the fascists of neighbouring countries coming to ravage them. Maybe you don't believe that Biden will do enough. But if you believe at all in human rights and solidarity, you should vote! If you believe in a liveable planet, you should vote! If you want to prevent a Third World War, Vote!",10984,1794,-0.995,0.131,0.758,0.111

Just look at its current iteration in Italy and arguably now in Israel also. These parties won‚Äôt move to go all of the way into banning democracy outright like in the 20th century. There is something very insidious about the populist right that although they introduce dangerous extremist rhetoric and the language of radical action I don‚Äôt think they will go all the way at least not until they have poured enough corrosive acid over the institutions and safeguards of democracy to let them whither away.Something Steve Bannon said once to this effect is that he considers himself a Leninist, that he wants to tear down the existing state. The whole point of a democracy is to facilitate a progression through it without mass upheaval by maintaining order through peaceful transition of power. What is frightening is seeing democracy as a tool to fascists and in a way like Lenin said about communism that state will whither away when the state has gone through its socialist stage.The international right is perversely like an inverted communist internationale all working towards the same goal it would seem. The common thread being that there is a globalist conspiracy to undermine national sovereignty and to open up borders.So will they go all the way or is democracy convenient to their need to first corrode the system from within to legitimize their post-fascism through democratic regression first.",1700,283,-0.0138,0.093,0.808,0.099

Tell this the EU states that run inhumane refugee camps at its borders. Tell this to the governments within the EU that make it illegal to save refugees from drowning and don't face any opposition from the EU government for it. Tell this to the EU which made a deal with the dictator of Turkey to keep refugees away from the EU borders. Tell this the same EU that just watched as Hungary and Poland slipped deeper and deeper into authoritarianism. That only now tries to contain Orban's fascism, now that it's already to late. Tell this to the past governments of Germany, one of the leading countries in the EU, which didn't do shit against the energy dependency on Russia because ""cheap gas and oil"". Tell this to German chancellor OLaf Scholz who just sold a large part of the harbour in Hamburg to China. Tell this to the EU which again did nothing when most companies moved production to China, which tried to improve the trade relations with one of the most authoriatarian countries on earth to make a profit despite a literal genocide taking place there. And now this exact same organisation watches again watches as fascism rises in Italy and Sweden, not defending democracy while its leaders congratulate fascist politicians to their elections.

Everything is there, we just need to access it.Vaush said everything he sees on the internet is just misinformation, propaganda etc. but you only get that if that‚Äôs what interests you. The internet recommends you based on what people positively respond to. My YouTube recommendations, apart from Vaush and a bit of left wing content is pretty much just great science channels, gaming etc. I don‚Äôt use Twitter, tik tok, Facebook. I use Instagram to see pictures of friends and share mine, which I don‚Äôt see as harmful.I think we are forgetting about teaching people to be responsible in the first place. Government censorship is a solution, sure. But the internet can be much healthier if people just engage responsibly. It‚Äôs a powerful tool, and we can use it for so much good. Never in history has knowledge been so easy to access, but it‚Äôs painful that people deliberately choose to not leverage what our ancestors would probably see as some kind of divine power.I‚Äôm worried about government censorship limiting information. What if the Republican Party takes power and limits information that is useful for us to advocate for trans rights? Every modern authoritarian regime has a common policy, restrict the internet. I understand that we feel like we can stop Republican misinfo by controlling the internet top down, but how can you ever ensure the power isn‚Äôt used against you?

He is enforcing fines of 4000 dollars a day on striking workers and 500k a day on the union in question, CUPE. He is attempted to force educational workers out of striking, but they have vowed to strike anyways. At this point, a second union, OPSEU has joined the strike.

Nearly all debates about BLM I see nowadays focus on the riots.  Did the left support the riots?  How much damage did the riots cause?  Who was responsible for the riots?When the real discussion that should be had is whether the BLM protests had a legitimate point.  And I think the answer here is obviously yes.  And the reality is that no matter how many riots happened, the cause was still valid.  So all the discussion about the riots is just a meaningless distraction.Second Jan 6.  Most of the discussion about Jan 6 is about the particulars of what happened during the actual insurrection.  Was it an insurrection?  Did the police ‚Äúlet them in?‚Äù  Was it really bad or just a bunch of tourists?  Isn‚Äôt this nothing compared to what the left did with BLM?When the real discussion should be about why these people decided to storm the capital in the first place.  And the answer is they did it because of deliberate lies told by prominent GOP politicians and the president.  Once again, this is the issue, all that other crap is a distraction.This shit drives me nuts.

But when I brought up Medicare For All or breaking up tech companies she would just say ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want socialism.‚Äù and then it turned into her begging me not to get another booster shot.Arguing broad ideas like that never goes *anywhere*. You have to plant really small, seemingly inconsequential, seemingly apolitical seeds in non-threatening contexts. Stuff that doesn‚Äôt appear to just blow up their entire political framework.For instance, at the Thanksgiving table, my parents mentioned the need for me to get new license plates. I casually brought up the fact that Tennessee is requiring people to choose between two plates: one that includes ‚ÄúIn God We Trust‚Äù and one that doesn‚Äôt. Then I explained how on one plate the numbers come first and then the letters, whereas on the other plate it‚Äôs the opposite. I said that police could easily distinguish between the two plates this way, and some people were worried this would allow police to discriminate against people who opted to not get the ‚ÄúIn God We Trust‚Äù plate. My parents were actually shocked and couldn‚Äôt believe that was happening. But I didn‚Äôt tell them ‚ÄúThis is precisely what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù I was more like ‚ÄúSome people are saying this. I kinda see their point.‚Äù That‚Äôs key. Conservatives are all about being free thinkers and independent researchers. You want them to think they came to these conclusions on their own.

1038,VaushV,"Vaush should talk more about med packs and not just guns. (Life saving info included) Owning a gun and having access to it in the event of widespread or even just localized political violence is a good idea. Like Vaush says if you have suicidal ideations or have attempted in the past you may not want immediate access or choose to not own one at all and that is a personal decision that I understand. However, even if you choose not to have a gun, and especially if you do, anyone can and should own medical gear that will hold you over until you or people you can help are able to get to a hospital or an ambulance gets to them. If you own a gun a great starting place is an IFAK. MyMedic makes a good consumer-friendly version called the ""TFAK"" which is currently on sale for Cyber Monday. But there are many options that give you the essentials for cheaper. I've heard North American Rescue I've heard is another great source for medical supplies but has too many options to the point where I was confused when I started looking into kits.   These kits have what you need to stop bleeding from bullet wounds or other heavy bleeding incidents. Including a tourniquet for cutting off circulation to an arm or leg, and gauze and bandages meant to stop heavy bleeding. Just these can be life-saving in situations where someone is bleeding out.   Getting a more advanced kit is also a great idea for emergency situations like political violence or even just natural disasters where help may be days or weeks from reaching you, I.E. hurricanes, blizzards, large-scale power outages from storms, severe flooding, etc.   Beau of the Fifth column has some videos recommending what to have in preparedness kits for these situations including med kits if you're interested. I'm not suggesting we all start prepping like right-wingers do, as they often go to extremes and just end up hoarding resources. But having what you need to survive a few days or weeks depending on where you live can be the difference between life and death. You are also currently more likely to find someone that's been in a car accident that you can save from bleeding out than you are to be in a situation where you can save someone by using a gun.   I hope vaush talks about these things more but until then I hope this page encourages some vaushites to get life-saving supplies. ",2352,419,0.9594,0.107,0.752,0.141

1105,VaushV,"Update: So, I had that debate with my father on trans issues, and I‚Äôm so grateful for your help. If you want to read my original post, you can find it here.As the title suggests, the debate happened. It was much more relaxed than I anticipated, and I believe it will become a regular thing as my dad seems to enjoy battling out ideas and questions.I also learned my father is much more philosophically educated than I assumed. While we disagree on the philosophy of ‚Äúwhat is god‚Äù (and technically ‚Äúis there a god‚Äù), he at least has axioms that he believes in and uses to support his ethics. ‚ÄúI belief there‚Äôs some authority, some being, some force that exists outside humans. To me that belief is God, this may not be the case for everyone though.‚ÄùIt may not be much, but I really made me appreciate his consistency and thought process more.However, onto the meat of the issue.I want to thank you all for the help! I never felt like I was on the back foot in the conversation. I am not the greatest rhetorician, and I may have phrased things imperfectly, costing me ground. However, I seemed to have stumped him a few times.He really needed to think when I presented the other forms of medical intervention we take to make lives more comfortable for us, such as corrective lenses and eye surgeries. Him being a Christian, I had to phrase things differently than I may have liked (e.g. ‚ÄúThese procedures are ways of helping people find the bodies god intended for them‚Äù).I also used the logic he presented of ‚Äúthe Fall of Adam created the existence of intersex people‚Äù to my advantage as well. Stating the Fall could easily allow for the ‚Äúpink brain blue body‚Äù phenomenon. Personally, I don‚Äôt *like* pink brain/blue body, but I had to hide my power level to appeal across the aisle with him.As I stated earlier in the post, this might continue. He said ‚ÄúThank you for the discussion, and I look forward to the next.‚ÄùWill he ever accept queerness? Probably not. Will he accept me being queer (when he finds out)? I have no idea. He‚Äôs much more reasonable than I was lead to believe.",2080,375,0.9914,0.039,0.805,0.157

1109,VaushV,"Genocide So I‚Äôve seen a lot of this community use the term genocide loosely. From a post describing the way society treats the neurodivergent, to also how trans people are suffering an on-going genocide.I‚Äôm going to focus on the trans side of this because it‚Äôs the most pressing, in that society being unaccommodating is clearly not genocide, and I say that as an autist. First I want to say that I absolutely agree that if the right wing in the United States gain power there‚Äôs the possibility, especially if democracy is taken away. That being said none of the points being made that people point to as being genocide are strong enough to be considered so. Sporadic acts of violence to not equate to genocide. Systemic discrimination does not equate to genocide either. Looking throughout history, there are cases of egregious discrimination that don‚Äôt rise to genocide, for example Jews in historical Europe. For centuries they suffered pogroms, hundreds killed at a time, but this still does not fit the definition of genocide, despite violence being inflicted, and then being discriminated against grossly, kept out of certain professions, and their ability to worship being limited.The term genocide was formed in the aftermath of the Armenian genocide and also the Holocaust. It‚Äôs necessary to want to destroy in part or in whole a group. And destroy here does mean kill. And through direct means, not suicide. The death marches the Armenians were sent on without adequate food or water, the shootings and death camps the Nazis created. Culturally destroying also does not suffice to call it a genocide, that would be a cultural genocide, and there‚Äôs certainly more of an open question on that as individual states bring in laws designed to limit how trans people can express themselves, and to attempt to keep them from coming out.While it may seem nitpicky to take issue with the word genocide being used to describe right now, I really don‚Äôt believe it is. The word is extremely important and needs to retain its meaning, in much the same way the right devalues pedo and groomer constantly by just throwing it out there. (this is of course a much bigger issue due to how they use it, and how they use it to try to dehumanise an entire group of people is the bigger issue, but it being devalued is still an important issue, it‚Äôs also entirely dishonest when the right uses pedo and groomer, it is not, I believe, dishonest here but merely a misunderstanding of the term)I fully agree that should the right overthrow democracy and act as autocratically as they want, things could devolve into being a genocide. But we‚Äôre not at that point yet, and that‚Äôs important because it means we shouldn‚Äôt be using that language to describe the current situation, and we should remember it isn‚Äôt *at all* inevitable. It‚Äôs still something that can be fought. Some people might ask why I care so much and I‚Äôd understand that perspective, but the biggest reason is WWII was my radicalising event, or rather WWII documentaries. As a kid I always loved engineering, and would watch stuff on planes tanks whatever, and soon that translated into other aspects, such as the Holocaust. This was before I was a teen. As I got older I realised the link between history and politics, and wanted to ensure we learned from our mistakes, and I studied political theory and public policy at university, and I‚Äôm now 25. Genocide has an *extremely* high bar to clear, and has to show the purposeful intent to kill a group in whole or in part, and in substantial numbers, through conditions that are either unsurvivable, like starvation, long death marches, crowded conditions leading to disease, or direct killings.This *does not* mean I care less about what‚Äôs happening to trans people daily in the US. But I also deeply care that the word genocide is kept for times when it is desperately needed, including for future use when it may be reoccurring. Despite my broadly anti-gun stance, I also do not blame anyone at this point for arming themselves should things devolve. Don‚Äôt mistake my reticence for caring deeply about what is and what is not genocide for not caring about trans people and their well being, that really is not the case.",4221,724,0.9478,0.093,0.783,0.123

1129,VaushV,"Mental illness and violent behavior I just read the comments under the joker movie thread and i find myselfe a little bit weirded out. First the notion that linking mental illness to criminal or harmful behavior somehow throws all mentally ill people under the bus. I get that there is much nuance needed to not lump it all together but i think it‚Äôs important to understand how mental illnesses work and what harmful behaviors they can enable. I personally think no healthy person is capable of a premeditated mass shooting. Even soldiers need to be ‚Äútrained‚Äù and conditioned to kill because it‚Äôs not normal human behavior. Why not acknowledge mental health problems with criminals? I am not saying all criminals are mentally ill, but if one is, it should be ok to point it out in a nuanced way. Wich leads me to my second point. The notion that mentally ill people still are capable of making ‚Äúright‚Äù choices and it‚Äôs not a mental illness that makes them abusers/criminals or harmful people it‚Äôs there personal choices. For the majority that might be true but there are definitely exceptions. Just from my personal experience. I came across a person with (i think, i don‚Äôt know the specific diagnosis) severe schizophrenia. He thought the hospital personal was after him and tried to kill him. Try to tell him, it is not ok to attack hospital staff, good luck with that. Another one, young girl maybe 17 at the time, survived more then 10 years of the worst kind of abuse, like burry underneath the prison level of abuse. Now she‚Äôs in therapy for antisocial tendencies, violent behavior and self harm (again i don‚Äôt know her specific diagnosis). Do you really wanna tell me she is in full control of this and could just stop behaving like that despite her mental problems?I think it‚Äôs hard for healthy people to imagine how mental health issues can very much impact your emotional responses and therefor distort your personal reality. I am diagnosed with NPD and after more then two years of therapy, when i look back at certain situations, i now know what went wrong but my emotions still tell me that in reality i was (and still am) the victim. What is this Post about? I think i just want to hear all your different viewpoints or experiences on the topic.

Star Wars is a universe that invented the wheel  (Clone Turbo Tank) but the Empire apparently decided to scrap that in favor of a super slow, large, cumbersome walker that walks on 4 legs and is only good at looking imposing for awhile until the enemy figures out a way to exploit a weakness. And don't get me started on the Death Star. Planet Killers are basically nukes in that they are frightening AND useless because even though the threat of armageddon isn't there galaxy wide, you're still wasting resources by showing your force. You can't kill all the planets or you'll have no empire or subjects to rule over. So, while some fanboys will get upset when you poke holes in the logic of Star Wars, the flaws actually make it more immersive for me. The design flaws are a happy accident when examining the series through a real world historical and philosophical lens. The Empire is Fascist and Fascist Empires tend to not last long and it didn't. Fascists are incompetent and incoherent. So was the Empire, more or less. Hitler was insecure about his public appearance. Palpatine presented himself as normal looking on public holoboards, hiding his scars.It gets you thinking. If the Empire is the Third Reich, is MAGA the First Order?",1710,291,-0.9963,0.259,0.641,0.1

If you look at one of the images, it‚Äôs got a desk that has a paper on it documenting an anti-CP case, something Vaush actually goes over in a video. Am I the only one who thinks that a company having documents discussing CP in the same shoot where they have a girl holding a teddy bear wearing BDSM gear is actually kind of weird? Like, if it was just the bear I‚Äôd get it, but this wasn‚Äôt a photo shoot where someone innocently created a leather daddy bear and literally just didn‚Äôt think that it would be seen sexually, there are explicit textual references to the abuse of children in this photo shoot. Even if this is just weird marketing, it‚Äôs still kind of fucked up, and we should probably stop claiming that Shoe started this drama, when she had kind of a reasonable reaction to a piece of reactionary content. If anything, it seems more like Merrick and Xan started this drama by doing the ‚Äúleftist overcompensating and accidentally playing into reactionary stereotypes‚Äù thing. Of course the people who got upset that she was upset where accused of being pedophiles, they‚Äôre defending a photo shoot that actively references the sexualization of children in the most explicit possible manner while also having a child holding a potentially sexual object. Idk, if you don‚Äôt wanna get accused of being a pedophile maybe learn why a leftist content creator is accusing a company of pedophilic behavior? It‚Äôs not pedo-jacketing when the person is actually defending suspicious shit.

1280,VaushV,"I read Michael Tracey's Holocaust denial essay because I hate myself. Here's my breakdown of it. TLDR: Michael Tracey cited *Heinrich Himmler* to prove that America is bad.I originally posted this to ShitWehraboosSay. I thought I'd share it with youse. This is mostly copy-pasted from my original post, with a few edits specific to his debate with Mr. V.Here it is. He treats the Holocaust as something that spiraled out of control once the US entered WWII. This *superficially* resembles a school of thought called ""functionalism."", but no functionalist historian argues that ""the Allies provoked Germany into killing the Jews."" That's just Tracey.It's **long**. The first half claims that Roosevelt used a salami-slicing strategy to get the US public ready for war. Michael focuses on the same things as in the debate: Lend-Lease, Iceland, those 3 naval clashes in the fall of 1941, and the oil embargo on Japan.*That* bit--that FDR wanted to intervene, but knew that he'd have to build the public's support--is believable. FDR wanted to do the right thing, and despite tough circumstances, he found a way to do it. In my book, that makes him a great president.Tracey then focuses on ""terror bombings"" like Dresden, as Nazi sympathizers are wont to do. Interestingly, while he larps as a functionalist about the Holocaust, he's downright intentionalist about the Allied bombing campaigns (emphasis mine):&gt; There is no coherent way to separate the justifiability of these deliberate, civilian-targeting aerial bombardment campaigns from the justifiability of entering the war. Because a foundational feature of the war was these deliberate civilian-targeting aerial bombardment campaigns. **""Deliberate, civilian-targeting aerial bombardment campaigns"" are no more separable from World War II than [...] ""house frame"" is separable from ""house.""**He's slimy and dishonest here too. Take this:&gt; The first ‚Äúcity bombing attack‚Äù conducted by British forces was in Mannheim, Germany on December 16, 1940He forgets that *Germany had been bombing Britain* since September 1940. The Luftwaffe switched from precision to area bombing within weeks. Coventry was bombed exactly one month before the RAF struck Mannheim. The Nazis called their raids ""Terrorangriffe."" Literally, ""terror attacks.""Coventry wasn't even the first. In May 1940, the Nazis did this to Rotterdam. The Nazis then told the Dutch that more cities would be bombed unless the Dutch surrendered. That's the most explicit ""terror bombing"" of the war, done by the Nazis, less than a year into the war.You may now quote Bomber Harris.He's also ignorant about basic philosophy regarding war:&gt; There‚Äôs a conceit that the manner in which a war is conducted can somehow be separated, in terms of moral judgment, from whether launching the war was justified. This ""conceit"" is called the *jus ad bellum* versus *jus in bello* distinction. Thomas Aquinas wrote about it in the 13th century. Almost every philosopher since Aquinas has recognized it.---**Holocaust Denial Starts Here**After **seven thousand words**, Tracey finally says what he wanted to say: that maybe if the US had sat WWII out, there would've been no Holocaust. He starts with an ""I'm not racist, but"" disclaimer:&gt; I have never claimed, nor am I claiming here, that the US ‚Äúcaused‚Äù the Holocaust, or that Nazi Germany bears any less responsibility for the Holocaust [...] What I‚Äôm saying is this: there is ample reason to believe [...] that US entry to World War II coincided with ‚Äî and may well have been a motivating factor in ‚Äî the acceleration of the most lethal phase of the Holocaust.He cites mainstream historians, but he does so dishonestly (eg, turning ""could have been"" statements into ""was""), and the way he uses sources is absurd. The worst is when he misuses this quote by Daniel Rafecas of Yad Vashem (emphasis is mine):&gt; By the fall of 1941 the Nazis [did not have] the required means to undertake a last stage to the Final Solution. In November 1941, the only facilities under construction designed to serve that end were **the gas vans in Chelmno and the three gas chambers at Belzec**.There it is: Holocaust denial. **Tracey is writing off Chelmno and Belzec.** This is **fucking crazy**. Those camps' existence proves that the Nazis had genocidal intent by 1941. Their sole purpose was to kill every inmate on arrival:* Chelmno had 7 known survivors out of 150,000 to 200,000 murders.* Belzec had 7 known survivors out of **400,000 to 500,000 murders.**Tracey also mentions the factoid that the Shoah's first gassings happened at Chelmno on Dec. 8, 1941. It's clear what he's doing. He's implying causality, as if the Nazis decided to start gassing the Jews overnight.Some of his sources are just bizarre. His citations include:* Heinrich Himmler's Posen speech, in which Himmler congratulated himself for preventing ""sabotage"" by slaughtering the Jews en masse.* Hitler's 1939 prediction that if war broke out in Europe, the Jews would be ""annihilated."" Which, as Vaush mentioned, Hitler made 9 months before starting a war in Europe.* This highlighted passage. Hitler attributed the new US-Soviet alliance as proof that the Jews controlled both DC and Moscow.I'd argue that if the Nazis could rationalize the Shoah this easily, then genocide was inevitable. It was only a matter of finding the right excuse.---That's enough of Tracey's statements. Now I'll focus on some things that he conspicuously *doesn't* mention.He says nothing about the Warsaw Ghetto, which was built in October 1940, when FDR was still promising neutrality.He doesn't mention the Nazis' genocides of non-Jews. Take the Intelligenzaktion. The Nazis shot about 100,000 Polish intellectuals, army officers, civil servants, writers, priests, and anyone else who might've kept Polish culture alive. They started this as soon as they invaded, and completed it by the end of 1940.He says almost nothing about Operation Barbarossa, which the Nazis launched 3 months before the USS Greer incident.The word ""Einsatzgruppe"" doesn't appear once.He doesn't mention the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, which the SS called to tell the rest of the Nazi state about what it had already decided to do.He doesn't mention the Baltics, where the Nazis encouraged local vigilantes to kill Jews in mobs starting in July.He also doesn't mention Babi Yar. That must've stung him. While Mariupol was being destroyed he wouldn't shut up about ""Ukro-nazis."" But it happened in September 1941, which is inconveniently early for his thesis.All of this, of course, happened after the Nazis had invaded and annexed neighboring countries. That's a crime in its own right, but it doesn't bother Tracey. ---God, writing this made me angry. Tracey's very proposal is repugnant. By his own admission, the Holocaust was underway long before the US and Germany fired shots. He's just JAQing off that *maybe* a monstrous, genocidal regime would've killed fewer people if the US had let it do whatever it wanted.Fuck Tracey. Fuck Hitler.

1359,VaushV,"Streams Feeling more Negative and Depressed Lately. As of late, I've moved to watch more Xanderhal because he is honestly one of the most insightful lefty content creators out there.  He's positive, high energy and overall it is criminal that he has as few subs as he does.  He is genuinely a fun guy to listen to and watch and He has much better intuition about politics than people twice his age and experience.  He is a bit rough around the edges due to a lack of formal education in sociology, politics, or economics but he has a great sense of understanding where the country is going and some good ways of taking action.This got me thinking about Vaush and why I'm watching less of his content.  Lately, Vaush feels very low energy, dismissive, and disinterested on stream.  It feels like he doesn't even want to stream anymore.  It's almost like he feels like he has given up against the fascists and is just trying to brace for the storm once it hits.  He is basically not talking about political issues anymore and every response to political issues is ""Buy guns, update passport, seek community.""  This is all good advice but isn't really very insightful or interesting.  It doesn't provide anything actionable it makes me feel like I'm a doomsday prepper. I'm constantly thinking to myself ""No wonder his community is so doomer everything lately feels so negative and hopeless (Don't be Doomer, do as he says not as he appears). The stream is mostly him just vibing with chat, playing games, and looking at shitty tweets from the Elonosphere (Right-Wing Twitter). It feels just so depressing and like there is no agency except in being prepared for violence.  I understand that violence at this point is inevitable but we have to be able to do more than just wait for the shots to be fired.  This prepper shit isn't helpful to anyone's mental health, I feel like I'm going crazy and at this point, I understand why conservatives go crazy because when you aren't being active in building a better community or world and instead are waiting for the worst you get antsy and you start going crazy.All analysis, positivity, actionability, and curiosity seem to have vanished from the streams.  Vaush is constantly arguing with chat about dumb shit, he appears more depressed, irritable, disengaged, and hopeless while on stream but he is constantly in Twitter beef with right-wingers. It's like non-stop how much he has been tweeting lately to idiots who will never respond back to him. It's like he has lost all love for streaming or doing politics which feels to me why he has stopped doing interesting content and instead gives the same ""Buy Guns, etc."" Response rather than actually engaging and being a positive force.I'm not in Vaush's head so I can't say for certain how he feels but to me, it just feels like he wants to vibe, play games, and do media/games stuff.  Which is fine.  I would only say that he needs to really think about what he wants and he needs to rebrand accordingly.  For those of us more interested in doing more political stuff, he should redirect us toward Xan if he wants to get out of the politics game.  I can understand that politics burns you out and it is hard to be positive and high energy in these dark times but hope is what gets people through the worst.  Optimism for a better future is what pushes the Ukrainian people it energizes them and makes push for a better future.  Something to hope for is essential to building good political movements. I think Vaush has lost that from my personal observation which is why his content has stagnated and he hasn't been doing as much good content has stagnated for the past year.  He is doing a little better recently but I honestly think that is mostly due to Elon, Twitter, and Ukraine stuff and not because of the general direction of the content.anyway, that is my personal analysis. I hope vaush is feeling okay.  I do enjoy his content overall but It has just taken a noticeable tonal shift and his former confident and positive personality has given way to a more negative one.  Perhaps it's because he has lost so many friends and he needs more lefty friends.

1395,VaushV,"'Neo-imperialism': The future talking point of America's nazbols? This post was inspired by a conversation I've had with friends regarding conservatives' reaction to the last two election cycles. We've all seen the maps where a swathe of red counties end up losing to only a handful or blue ones- leaving conservatives perpetually dumbfounded and angry because they can't possibly image more people living in cities.It's a silly question in the grand scheme of things- but what happens when this perpetual situation becomes rebranded as a from of 'neo-imperalism'? You have a population center living possibly hundreds of miles away from you -who dont share the same needs or views as you- dictating laws and legislation that end up affecting *you*, and no amount of voting against it will seemingly work- as there simply is more of them than you. Of course, this is simple democracy, but It *can* be an understandable situation. Living in NY for example, upstate NY always feels like it's beholden to the population of NYC above all else.Reading about the concept of 'popular sovereignty' and the 'internal colonies', I'm concerned that the current conservative talking points about this may coalesce into a core ideology/platform in the future. One that may end up appealing to Hinkle-style ""leftists"" who latch onto the 'anti-imperalism' rhetoric of it. And if so, any violent 'resistance' by them will become branded as a ""struggle"" to them. Laws and enforcement resulting from their actions will be waved off by them as ""oppression"" and blatantly opposed.This *is* already happening, but I genuinely fear what will happen if this becomes the hot, new thing they end up latching onto above all else.

1396,VaushV,"Can someone help me understand the argument of why fighting to keep Shoe on the left is a net positive? So I get why fighting to get as many people on the left is a positive thing, and Shoe is a person who has a large following. But I guess my question at this point would be similar to, ""Can someone help me understand the argument of why fighting to bring Dave Rubin to the left is a net positive?"" I've had a therapist in my past tell me that they couldn't work harder than me when it comes to our treatment. And at this point, Shoe feels like she's clawing and kicking and screaming to go over to the reactionary conspiratorial side and it's people on the left trying to hold her by her leg while she's kicking them in the face.I would get it if she has an open forum on her twitter and maintains a left-leaning audience. But no, she blocks every liberal and leftist in sight who dares to criticize her, but maintains a nazi audience because she thinks it's funny according to Xan. So she's actively cultivating a right-leaning audience and follows several dangerous accounts like Libs of Tiktok.Even her videos are starting to swing in the other direction. They've always maintained a reactionary sort of vibe in terms of her presentation, but she released a video recently about why ""misinformation is good actually"". Followed shortly by trying to advocate for Alex Jones to be re-platformed (A reminder that Alex Jones spread conspiracies about the Sandy Hook shootings to such a degree, that several parents moved and one father took his own life because he couldn't handle the lost of his child and the harassment).And at this point, Vaush's reactions almost feel like being gaslit primarily because I've seen him go harder towards people who have essentially been on our side but imperfect. Full disclosure, I was coming off of being a fan of Krystal and Saagar's show (forgot what the first iteration was called now) when Vaush started covering them. And Vaush went SO hard against Krystal and I thought it was weird. I agree that Krystal's belief of aligning with someone on ""the new right"" to spread populist ideas is a terrible idea. But I've seen Krystal push back **hard** against Saagar. She advocates for leftist beliefs on twitter, she made Bill Maher look like an idiot on his own show by arguing for leftist beliefs, she very clearly. At face value, she appears to be someone who tries to be an ally with flawed beliefs and executions (When you dig into her it's a little more iffy, but mainly speaking from the perspective of Vaush's initial take which was just seeing her on the show with Saagar). Meanwhile, Shoe is like a monkey with a loaded handgun who has shot a few people and Vaush is standing by, rubbing his temple going ""What do you want me to do? It's a monkey. I know it's bad, I've said it's bad, but it's a monkey.""His argument about treating her like it's your racist grandpa doesn't stand either because our racist grandpas don't have megaphones with people standing by listening to them and waiting to go into action depending on what they have to say. And even if they did, I would have to come out against my racist grandpa. If Christian Walker (of all people) can do it, then so can I.I guess I just don't understand why there have been any arguments that she's someone worth trying to hold onto when she's someone who's cultivating a right-wing audience, following right-wing people, dating someone on the right, who believes in conspiratorial right-wing ideas, and has been confirmed by several people who know her personally not to listen to any sort of criticism. Again, I'd get it if she was an individual or if she continued to maintain a left-wing audience, but it feels as though she's been running to the right since Biden was elected.",3787,672,-0.9873,0.119,0.8,0.081
1397,VaushV,"Vaush turned into a leftie Tucker Carlson Vaush's content for the past 6 months has been a non-stop campaign of fearmongering and it's getting tiring. He offers very shallow analysis of what he covers and the message always is that you're gonna end up in a concentration camp. And even when something positive happens, he either dismisses it as an unimportant victory or as something that will only buy a bit of time before everything collapses.Don't get me wrong, I do realise the threat that america faces from the republicans, but what vaush is doing is completely irrational. Not only is america far from a guaranteed dissolution of it's democracy by the republicans, but even if that happens, concentration camps and genocides are very unlikely ( just look at russia or belarus, two much more homophobic and fascistic countries, which aren't doing and never did do a genocide against LGBTQ+ people).I'm subscribed to vaush since late 2019 and probably watched 90+ percent of his content. I watched him for his deep and well thought analysis on subjects he covered, but nowadays it's just shallow fearmongering. It's getting hard to watch his stuff and I think I'm not the only one judging by his recent subscriber growth. I don't think that shallow fearmongering works as well on leftists as it does on  MAGA republicans. Vaush has been a very influential figure for my political views and he has changed them a lot, so it's sad to see him abandoning well thought and funny political analysis and turning into a leftie Tucker Carlson, who only fearmongers about the future.",1578,267,0.7656,0.061,0.855,0.085

That's the interpretation that he has doubled down on with the faintest shreds of evidenceThe primary problem with Dan Schneider wasn't the weird episodes of icarly, it was that he was abusing people and the weird episodes were a red flag that people put together after the abuse had been known. The red flag in this case is a stuffed animal with a leather harness being held by a child in a normal dress.  Dan Schneider's were actually making children be a part of his sexual life and making images sexualizing them. If a child holding a bear with vague sexy gear in order to sell that product is the justification for calling someone a pedo, then half of the video games is pedo stuff, wrestling is pedo stuff, cartoons are pedo stuff.He has already admitted that he has to tread lightly because of personal relationships, which is his prerogative, but him needing to also be right is making him do messed up thing like accusing someone of being a pedo with almost no evidence. Doesn't he know how that feels?The likely answer to why Balenciaga is removing it might have something to do with not wanting to be included in this ongoing wave of violence that the right is pretending is about protecting children from abuse.Vaush has yet to prove that any abuse is actually happening, he's literally going off of vibes and inconsistent standards.

Now I've seen the pics and while I can definitley see that it was really meant to be a pic of a teddy bear wearing early 2000s mall goth/emo clothing, I can see where some people might get some yikeschills from it.   Take it back to the 1980s when long haired men and loud guitars ruled the world, a lot of metal fashion was an integration of gay leather fashion a la Tom of Finland (thank you, Rob Halford) into mainstream culture. A lot of those fasion choices carried over to other subcultures including punk, goth, emo etc.  Bringing it back to the teddy bear ads, it semed to really be based on early 2000s ""mall goth"" fashion, where chicks used to wear studded chokers, leather straps etc. that do kinda sorta look like fetish gear even if it really isn't.   But anyway, the broader point I'm trying to make is that people are so fucking selective over what to get outraged over. I was walking in my local mall the other day and I found that the area where they put the mall santa in was right next to what I can only describe as a hoisery/lingerie shop (not Victorias Secret) where one of the manniquins was wearing a halter top with all sorts of lace and studs on it and the panties were what can only be described as a jockstrap for women, with the ass all hanging out and everything. Now, if that was a sexy MEN'S underwear shop, you could just imagine the Helen Lovejoying coming from the right.

1474,VaushV,"Shoeonhead is an irresponsible unreliable conspiracy brained reactionary and the balenciaga situation clearly shows that. Firstly, let's clear up what the balenciaga situation is.Balenciaga got photographer Gabriele Galimberti (who's famous for his ""Toy stories"" series in which he photographs children all around the world with their toys and posts them on his Instagram) to do some photoshoots with children with child toys and some balenciaga brand items/clothes. Two of those photoshoots show a girl holding teddy bear hand bags, one of them is in a kind of goth style dressed in gothic clothing /items and the other seems to be wearing a bdsm esque cross strap, which is indeed weird but most likely just is a dog harness since you can see the same girl in the same  room with the same teddy bear in another photoshoot about pet/dog items, (I'm talking about the teddy bear hand bags). On a completely separate disconnected photoshoot balenciaga did like a messy desk job/profesional job photoshoot in which they printed a bunch of court papers it seems to use as props. Well one of those papers was about virtual cp (the paper was an anti-cp case btw). Now that we're caught up let's see what Shoeonhead said/did.She made a conspiratorial tweet insinuating that those 2 photoshoots with the teddy bears are pedophilic and connected to the other photoshoot with the desk and papers (they are not). She then says that the virtual cp court paper (which is anti-cp) was purposefully poorly hidden into the photoshoot. This is completely unsupported, she has no reason or evidence to make such a heavy conspiratorial claim. This conspiracy of ""they/the elite have to tell the truth""/""hiding the truth in plain sight"" that Shoeonhead is pushing in that post is nothing new. It's an extremely common far-right/antisemitic conspiracy that states that the elite are hiding subliminal messages to program the masses and that they have to tell/show the truth to avoid karmic consequences. I'm not saying she's far-right or antisemitic, I'm just stating what she is doing/seems to be doing intentionally or not.Under her tweet she posted an image showing that balenciaga left twitter to protest elons takeover of Twitter and another image saying ""why are you running"" with a caption ""interesting timing"" insinuating that balenciaga left twitter due to the whole supposed pedophilia thing, again another unsupported conspiracy brained take. And underneath that she says ""THEY DELETED ALL THEIR INSTAGRAM POSTS LMAO"" with an image showing exactly that, clearly insinuating that again they did that due to the whole supposed pedophilia thing (again another unsupported conspiracy brained take), but the thing is that if she took 5 seconds to Google search ""why did balenciaga delete their Instagram posts"" (less time then it would have taken for her to write that tweet) she would have found out that balenciaga has done that multiple times before, such as in 2021, and that it's some kind of symbolic/ceremonial thing they do when another person is in charge or they're in a new ""chapter"" of sorts. But no, she chose to stick to her insane  unsupported conspiracy theory.And I know that she knows all of this because she blocked a person that had replied to merricks reply to her tweet which was saying most of the things that I explained here, meaning that she saw merricks post.

And sorry I'm coming of so hostile but I'm fucking pissed at the left online because they're heavily implying that queer people are pedophiles. Online lefties are helping the right perpetuate wonderful queer people like my friends who I adore are pedophiles. Shoe simply posted a tweet about capitalists being pedos. Yes most capitalists are pedophiles. And the online left basically said any attack on capitalist pedophiles is an attack on the queer community.I know that the shooting of a queer club recently happened and the right wing (a bunch of pedophiles) immediately jumped to subtlety and explicitly jumped to tie a tweet about capitalist pedophiles to the queer community but the left just helped them have that narrative.The left blacked up that narrative that the queer community is a bunch of pedophiles. If you get mad at someone for tweeting about capitalist pedophiles immediately after someone shot up a queer club you're helping to make that connection.Think fuckers think. The online left is helping the right control the narrative. I'm pissed about that. How have pedophiles (the right wing) convinced the left to get mad at people for talking about capitalist pedophiles? This doesn't happen the other way around. This is so fucking backwards. It's ok to get mad at Shoe she's an incredibly insecure retard. But she never did anything to make any connection between the queer community and pedophila. Not nearly as much as online leftists and rightoids have. Everyone around her has. Left and right. How the online left is reacting now is the same as how they would react if they supported MAPs are part of the queer community. I'm not saying shoe's tweet should have been ignored or she isn't weirdly more civil with the right (which I slightly get because they're smarter about how they interact with her) and I get how it's scary that she has such a large and powerful platform. But the online left is only making it worse.Holy shit think about that. The left has to be careful about how and when they talk about pedophiles but the right (pedophiles) can talk about it how and whenever they want? Who seems like the guilty side then? I'm sorry but I'm just so pissed the left is letting the right have this. The online left is reacting to the right call queer people pedophiles by being mad about a post about capitalist pedophiles.

1505,VaushV,"It's actually not surprising that people want Vaush to be more aggressive towards Shoeonhead Why?Because a hell of a lot of what Vaush does is ""affect"" work. He cathartically takes apart things that are obviously wrong, but that people want to be shown to be wrong by someone with a big enough and confrontational enough personality that they can feel a kind of relief that someone sees what they see.-When he debates someone, many in the audience don't just want him to be right, they want him to generally undermine someone who is saying terrible and/or reprehensible things, whether that's on trans issues or Ukraine, where people present themselves as being reasonable rational people just asking questions, and he digs into the underlying emotional stakes that *should* come along with what they are discussing. Regardless of how they see themselves, the consequences of their actions or arguments entail a set of emotionally resonant consequences that he brings to the surface.One side of what Vaush does is argument, about trying to take apart what people are saying, but another side is vitriol, about pushing against their public persona and self-image, and people want a bit of that.For example, is Shoeonhead genocidal, because whatever she believes, she supports outcomes that lead towards genocide? That's certainly what Vaush has said in the past.And people have felt safer, and felt vindicated, because there is someone able to say that about ""conservatives"" generally.Because how much of the anti-trans propaganda is being shared by some concerned mother on a pro-life facebook group or whatsapp channel worried about safety for her kids, and not being responsible about checking what she puts out?And if that is a problem, how much more does that apply, to someone who is becoming a central organising node for the propaganda network that sells that ""sensationalist child protection clickbait -&gt; anti-trans groomer rhetoric -&gt; active stochastic terrorism and general repression"" pipeline.She is part of the system, and she can reflect on her role, and what she ""doesn't want to be"", and actually *act* on it, or she can self-consciously allow herself to become a part of that.-It's obvious that Vaush has certain biases, that there's people he doesn't want to debate because it makes him sad, either because they have had a formative influence on his own political development (Wolff, Chomsky, D) or - particularly at the moment - because he puts more stock in maintaining online friendships, and generally just doesn't want to go hard against people he otherwise likes.But even if that is acknowledged, but having ""the big cis dude who wants to protect trans people, and goes after those who attack them"", *not* go after someone who is also a strong participant in the same networks as other people he attacks, is jarring and uncomfortable to many people, and naturally so.In one sense, the answer is simple, you just need more than one Vaush in the space, so that they can each cover what the other won't, with the appropriate scale of reaction.What you need is some Canadian bearded dude to come out with a big video on Shoe, full of barbed insults and jokes which Vaush reacts to, cringes, laughs, and then is like ""Shoe, what do you want me to say? He's right.."".This isn't xcom where everyone in your party overwatches things directly behind them, and then all miss and let it through anyway, Vaush has a firing arc, and accepting that and promoting other flawed but potentially helpful people who can cover his blindspots as far as aggression is concerned seems a natural conclusion.",3613,597,-0.3173,0.118,0.757,0.126

1554,VaushV,"How good is this pro trans rhetorical technique? Ok, simple idea for an opening minimal case: With respect to how any particular trans woman or trans man uses the terms ""woman"" or ""man"" it is the case that they are a man or woman according to their own usage. This seems like a slam dunk to me. I've never met a trans man whose usage of the word ""man"" excluded themselves, nor a trans woman whose usage of the word ""woman"" excluded themselves. So this technique would immediately lead into the very winnable debate about objective definitions, and then we can proceed to utilitarian analysis of word usage. Obviously there could be, I guess, somewhere in the world, a trans woman whose usage of the term ""woman"" includes ""capable of getting pregnant"" which would exclude herself, but that's mostly a potentially interesting edge case.I'm feeling like a fucking genius, which probably means Im being a fucking idiot.

It's not just libsoftiktok, but they directly attack individuals, organizations, and events that then leads to real world harassment and violence. Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, Charlie Kirk, Prager U, etc. are all part of the problem too.If they think these people are committing crimes by ""grooming"" kids or whatever, they should report that to the authorities or file a lawsuit. Instead, they're engaging in what I would argue is vigilantism by posting this stuff and expecting others to go after these innocent people. There's no harm being done to these kids, but the harassment and violence against LGBTQ people is real. So what can we do? I was thinking of writing to my representatives to call for an investigation. But I'm just one person (and even posting this gives me a ton of anxiety, I just like to live a quiet life and keep to myself). I know some will say it's all free speech, but I think their posts are attacks and they know other people will take it further.

All of the following is assuming that the shooting was a hate crime, but we don't know for sure yet.Anyways, decided to go see what those folk were saying about the shooting on that God-Forsaken Bird App. They are basically trying to insinuate that the shooting happened because LGBT activists, more specifically ""trans activists"" went ""too far."" That if it wasn't for these drag performers they believe are groomers, people wouldn't feel justified in shooting up these places. So basically insinuating that shooters like these are somewhat justified in their anger/hatred. After all, if children are being groomed by these pedophile drag queens and the police aren't doing anything, what else is there to do? I feel like these people are so close to realizing the results of their rhetoric around these issues, or just don't care. That basically it doesn't matter if people died, trans people are always the bigger enemy and thus tragedies like these are only unfortunate outcomes in their quest to make life as hard as possible for trans people, and in some cases, just LGBT people in generalI hope Elon runs that site into the ground.

I was ‚Äúanti-woke‚Äù, read Jordan Peterson, liked Stonetoss and still thought Sargon of Akkad was smart (lol) I give Vaush 90% of the credit for pushing me left and starting me on my journey to becoming a libertarian socialist.

This space is very different now.It‚Äôs become kind of an ideological ‚Äúecho chamber‚Äù for lack of a better term. That‚Äôs why he is not growing. He has completely lost whatever made him digestible to a politically diverse audience, normie, broader audience. There is a reason the other left wing debate bro is blowing up.

To make things worse most of the internet has shut Vaush out so he‚Äôs basically alone with just himself and his fans. He spends a lot of time preaching to the choir. He needs to fix this.Shoe has her flaws and is impulsive but she still has the reach Vaush lost. The TPUSA stream they did together was gold and Vaush needs to collab with more people who aren‚Äôt necessarily in the same genre.Now maybe Vaush has moved on from being the relatable edgy gamerbro who makes content for other edgy gamerbros and pulls people left.

Everytime I find a link to a paper, the paper says something totally different than they claim it does and is usually not climate skeptical at all. Even scientists like Judith A. Curry, who plays a lot into the ""I am the climate skeptics scientist who fights the establishment"" role, her papers are all basically saying that anthropogenic climate change is real and a threat. Has anyone of you ever had an online debate with a climate skeptic that has actually provided a paper (doesn't have to be a good paper) that actually holds climate skeptic positions, and if yes, could you link it? The r climateskeptic subreddit has been useless, the top posts are nothing but greta thunberg memes and I scrolled for a while and found nothing. In threads about evidence, they only vaguely point at organisations that, if examined, do not support anything they like to claim.",1593,277,-0.9523,0.158,0.747,0.094

We were raised conservative and religious, and even though he's become more open minded over the past few years, there is no way he's going to change his mind and become pro-choice.

Different mastodon servers are not ""sub servers"" they are literally ""servers"" that anyone- including you, can host. You can run a Mastodon server out of your basement, the source code is public and free to download.But what makes Mastodon special is that despite running it out of your basement, you can still follow, comment, boost and otherwise interact with anyone else using it. So it's not like a classic ""forum"" where you make your own forum, invite your friends and only you use it. You set it up, invite people in, and then you follow and talk to people *outside* of your server, just like twitter.So basically, I don't understand why Vaush thinks it isn't a viable alternative to twitter, because it is.If you have any other questions I can answer them for you.",1237,205,0.992,0.0,0.801,0.199

I don‚Äôt think DeSantis has it in him to attempt a Jan 6. If he were to destroy democracy, it would be through the system itself, like Mitch McConnell. He wouldn‚Äôt incite a lynch mob to come and murder Congress people.Trump will absolutely try and attempt sedition again, which may or may not work. But the fact that there is a possibility that it could is very concerning. DeSantis could at least buy us some time so we can make our plans for a post-fascist America.Also another big thing that Trump has over DeSantis is a cult of personality. All evil dictators throughout human history require a cult of supporters to rally behind them. Trump comes across as a charismatic populist, thanks to his years on TV, which DeSantis lacks. He‚Äôs too much of a typical politician. Even conservatives who really like him don‚Äôt worship him like they do with Trump.So I think we should take them both very seriously, and hope they take each other out.",1420,251,0.5283,0.101,0.792,0.107

She's against humane rufugee policies because she's afraid that it'll hurt Germany. She is against Covid vaccines and mask mandates. She also thinks that the Linke shpuldn't focus on climate policy as much as it does now since she thinks it brings the party ""out of touch"" with the people. And she's also a Russian asset, speaking for Putin, is aginst sanctions, wants usto import gas from Russia, blames NATO and Ukraine for the war etc. And yet she is one of the most popular politicians in Germany right now. While Die Linke is horribly unsuccesfull Wagenknechts star continues to rise despite her being an outcast in her own party. Now there's more and more  rumors about her wanting to found an own party. And as polls stand right now she would be at least more succesfull than Linke, FDP (neoliberal party) and AFD (neoliberal fascist party) and maybe could even reach Gr√ºne (green party) and SPD (moderate SocDem party ) levels. Obviously there's still a lot of time until the next election for her to fuck up her support, new parties almost never work in Germany since they always lack funding and popularity if they're not a faction in the Bundestag and the poll is phrased in a ""could you imagine"" way which obviously can mean anything to the people voting ""yes"" for example ""I don't like her but if she has good social policies I might vote for her"". Still it's scary how many dumb people we have. Not US level bad and it could be a lot worse of course, Germany still is among the most stable and least fascist countries in Europe at the moment.",2480,421,-0.8899,0.106,0.802,0.092

Genuine Question, because I don't know everything about the history of every country, but the more I learn about Revolutions, the more this perspective I have becomes solidified.Considering Post-Revolutionary chaos and infighting that happens (French Revolution, Russian Revolutions, Ir√°n Revolution, etc.), was the relative (and I DO mean RELATIVE) stability of the United States Post-Revolutionary War, an Exception to the rule? Like, I know that the transition from Continental Congress to Articles of Confederation, to Constitution wasn't without its bumps or bloodshed, but even something like Shay's Rebellion seems fairly miniscule to France's Reign of Terror or Russia's Civil War.I'm not saying this is a prescriptive assessment of America's unique character or anything like that, I think several factors such as distance, population size, and lack of direct interference from world powers helped.But Nevertheless, is Post-Revolution chaos and bloodshed between Factions the norm, and Am√©rica lucked out?",1059,154,-0.8693,0.141,0.762,0.097
1733,VaushV,"Should Bitch Be Thought of as a Slur? Recently on Tiktok, there's a guy who has had a bit of a come-up, he makes little satire music videos. He's used this to try and start a semi-serious music career. One of his songs uses the word bitch a lot and calls someone a bitch. He started getting some criticism for this as the term is seen as misogynistic, he got criticism even from Julia Fox; for those who don't know, Kanye briefly dated her after his divorce from Kim Kardashian. The guy responded to her saying a lot of things, essentially saying it was hypocritical of her to criticise him for being problematic when he dated Kanye during a time where he was harassing Kim and Pete. During this video he does unironically make a few sexist remarks that's led to him getting further criticism, especially since he responded that in his song that uses the term; he is the person who is being referred to, i.e. it is self-referential and he is the bitch.I don't really care about this though, there was a response video that said Bitch was a slur and it really got me thinking. Should it be seen as one? It's comparing a woman to a dog, it seems like we have a pretty visceral reaction when a man calls a woman a bitch as an insult, similar to other slurs. It's not like cracker because women are a marginalised group. Even using it self-referentially or in reference to someone who's not a women seems problematic because just imagine that but replace bitch with r\*tard, it certainly seems like that wouldn't be okay. So what's the fundamental difference? I don't know what people's reactions are going to be, there may be a lot of ""wokeness has gone too far"" comments, but there are many words which are considered slurs now which were normalised at one point in time. It seems to me like Bitch should be thought of as no different to slurs like the t slur or the r slur. Please good-faith engagement, like I said idk if people are gonna go ""PC gone mad"" or ""wow, you're right"" so like if it's the former keep it respectful :)",2027,374,-0.8299,0.131,0.771,0.098

I think people watch him because he has funny and entertaining takes on politics and general news, these generally come out in debates or whilst he watches a video. However, these types of segments have been few and far between recently. And mostly all of his content is talking segments which involve a ton of stun locks as there is no pacific focus. This also coincides with these types of talking segments stretch out for so long that he seems to get board and go and play games. 2022 so far has paled in comparison to what he did in 2021 or the years prior.

1902,VaushV,"My take on the assisted death situation (trigger warning) I believe you should not have the  right to kill your self and only mercy killings should be allowed. What I mean by mercy killing is only if there is no other way to help a person and is physically in pain and suffering and killing them will cut the suffering short. When it comes to being depressed I believe that there is still hope for that person to live and the mental anguish is mostly self inflicted. What I mean by this is if someone you know is depressed you are responsible for letting them die. Because that person was not interested in expressing their inner suffering. Because of social factors like being taught to be emotionally strong by letting it stew in their minds until it boils over. We as a society must make being emotional a common part of the human experience. And only then can people get help where they otherwise would not have. It‚Äôs a dangerous vicious cycle when you‚Äôre suicidal because you think about doing it over and over again until your mind has seen taking your own life as the only solution. It‚Äôs kinda like smiling, if you smile enough you can trick your mind into being happier. But it works both ways. Please for your sake if your reading this and are depressed use your regional suicide hot line. You can be helped and help will come to you. You just need to reach out. You might not think no one cares but I care Damn it. There‚Äôs more to life then what you think. Your mind is capable of creating beautiful things. It would be a great shame to let that creativity and wonder die with you. I may not know you personally. But a death is a tragedy no matter how or where or when it happens. I‚Äôm sorry but this is a very emotional subject for me because I too have struggled with depression and loneliness. And I just don‚Äôt others to deal with that. I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on my greatest foes. So yeah I disagree with vuash. You don‚Äôt deserve the right to commit suicide. Because you‚Äôre not fully in control when you are depressed.

And with the recent Balenciaga stuff, it went insane.I have watched Xanderhals, Demon Mamas, and now Vaushs response to the latest ""I won't apologize vid"" from shoe. And I think, all of them from their point of view are great videos on this. I didn't care much about Shoe before, and I probably won't care much for her after all of this, with the knowledge that I don't miss anything.With all this now said, I just wanted to voice, that **I appreciate Vaushs take** on the video and all this recent Shoe drama. The part Im happy with is, that Vaush called out Shoe for her BS, and the terrible framing in her last video. I get the pressure Vaush gets from the left for being friends with Shoe and that he was hesitant with criticizing her, but overall I think his take addressed the issue with Shoe perfectly, while also talking about the ""Shoe derangement syndrome"" going on in the left. I hope, that Vaushs response won't destroy their friendship, and I think Vaush and Shoe staying friends would be better for everyone. Shoe still having friends in the left at least gives the opportunity for her to reflect on the criticism, while having no more ties could lead to her drifting into farther right spaces.I myself have some right wing friends, and I don't agree with them and call out their BS, but I'm still friends with them. **The best way to get someone out of far right extremism is to give them a friendly community that calls out their BS, so they realize in the future that they were wrong.** I heard something from a YouTuber (cant remember who), that said, **he doesn't debate people to pull them over in an instant. He does it to plant seeds, and those seeds will one day grow, but it takes time.** Sometimes it takes month, sometimes years. The more seeds you sow, the more likely it is they change their mind one day.**Ousting someone out of a Community just means, they lose a source of getting better ideas.**",2058,375,0.9921,0.066,0.779,0.155

(Now to be clear, the far left has already lost the culture war on this issue, but those who remain should drop it).\- We should call paedophiles MAPs. (We should not call paedophiles ""minor attracted persons"", it destigmatizes paedophilia).\- There is an ongoing trans genocide (No there isn't).\- We should support fat acceptance (There is nothing good about being fat at all, and no we are not talking slightly overweight, those who support it tend to mean for obese people).\- It is totally okay to wear BDSM gear and other weird sexualized stuff Infront of children on purpose during pride (Very weird and no, I see no reason why it should be normalized to wear fetish gear infront of kids).Those are just some examples, but they illustrate my point.

2036,VaushV,"Pathetic Shoe post Ok, I genuinely don't know where to start on this one. Do I unironically drop the ""shoe helped turn me left in 2015/2016"" shit first or with the apology/admitting to being wrong in replies I don't think most of you read? I think I'll start by admitting this is incredibly pathetic and I know it, this might be the most pathetic post on this sub in the last year at least. Making a fuckin reddit post about admitting to being dumb for defending ShoeOnHead for a couple of replies, real down bad hours over here. I know MOST online leftists are pretty anti-shoe, and I get it. I've read the criticisms for years, I know the central points very well. I found Shoe when I was 15, when political Youtube was just getting out of its Gamergate phase, yet still in its Big Red in every thumbnail, feminist cringe compilation phase. Definitely wasn't right leaning in any way, was maybe more center/center-left, but I just didn't know shit. I had ZERO knowledge of anything. The most political I was at the time was enjoying Rage Against the Machine and agreeing with their baseline beliefs. A friend and I were obsessed with cringe comps, but not even political ones, we were into any cringe comps. Emo cringe, furry cringe, etc. It's only natural you come across ""feminist cringe"" compilations that way. From there, we stumbled across youtubers like Shoeonhead, Chris Ray Gun, you know the ones. This is the way I got into politics. I literally only clicked on Shoe's vids because she looked like an older version of my girlfriend, which should serve as some subtext that explains enough. None of those other 2015-2016 political youtubers stuck for me at that age. Chris was just never that funny, I always hated Sargon, obviously thought shit like Ben Shapiro was lame, Armored Skeptic became obviously cringe to me after a few videos, when it was obvious Blaire White was dishonest, I stopped watching her immediately. You get the point. I was stupid and ignorant in a 15 year old way, and clearly I was always going to lean more left than anything. Shoe was the only one of these Youtubers that stuck around for me. When she openly supported Bernie Sanders in 2015, and I subsequently learned about Bernie and his policies, my world opened up, and from then on I gained more knowledge on various leftist theories etc, you get it. Obviously, that era of Shoe content is not worth defending, there's plenty of phenomenally bad takes in several videos that even at my peak of Shoe defending, by the time I was aware enough, I would not defend. However, by 2019, Shoe felt like she was turning for the better. Most of her peers had gone so far right, or stayed just plainly center and reactionary, Shoe was becoming more openly soc-dem. She always was left-ish, but she was growing MORE left. Like I said, I'm very aware of the main criticisms people have had of her even since her becoming more openly Soc-dem. Personally, I'm a bit more lenient than some, I don't really care about people being the perfect little leftist. I've always felt like she should delete those older videos, but I was never going to HOLD honestly anything against her. At one point the whole ""pattern of behavior"" argument felt moot, as most of the criticisms of shit felt like it was far enough in the past, part of a larger problem online left spaces have that feel antithetical to unity, and I'm willing to give a lot of people room for error.Which is why the past half a year, she's really disappointed me, and this Balenciaga saga is a personal turning point in the worst way. I did not pay attention to anything about it, because I personally don't care about conspiracy shit. I saw people replying to the post with debunks, and that was enough for me to brush it off as typical Shoe conspiracy posting. Did I think it was lame of her to post, especially with the timing? Absolutely, but that's all I processed it as: lame. When she put out the video, she swayed me. All I can attribute this to, personally, is just an absolute lack of brain power. Just straight up not thinking about it at all. She appealed to that part of me that strongly dislikes leftists who get really elitist about who is actually left, leftists who throw the term ""grifter"" around as though anyone who doesn't adhere to their strict idea of how to be is actually a faker and doesn't really understand Marxist theory etc. I think its pretty reasonable to say the pictures in question are....suspect. I never bought into this pizza-gate-esque bullshit, obviously, but the way she edits that video, it makes it seem like some people are just straight up ignoring that, or outright defending its oddity. So, yeah, I knew people on this sub have a hate-boner for her, so I went out of my way to see just what kind of shit people were saying, and did a little Shoe defending. At this point, its unquestionable that she really has this pattern for spreading right wing ideas and getting uptight and defensive when people call her out for it, and this time is no different. I know most of you reading are thinking ""no shit."" I knew that she was kinda like that already, but this time I legitimately believed the idea that, what she was doing wasnt THAT bad. ""This is just certain leftist circles being overly critical,"" I thought. ""Yeah, there are right wing followers of hers that are taking her worst points and running with them, but she herself isn't being as dumb as they think she is."" Stupid. I've deleted those replies, but there's no excuse. This is genuinely the point where someone like me has to admit, she's gone too far to defend, this is really  REALLY bad. At the root of all of this, as much as people joke about Shoe Simps, the real bottom line is that I don't want her to be like this. I know she's capable of being better than this. She could easily not be this person. In her better moments, she's way smarter than to just openly parrot right wing sentiments and thinking and burn bridges over criticism. At least that's how I felt. I know a lot people feel like its a dumb, pathetic sentiment, I really just don't want her to be this person. Either way, this was just to say that you guys were right. She is back in atrocious territory. I don't like it.",6236,1124,-0.9961,0.153,0.735,0.112

2081,VaushV,"Watching Vaush helped me get the confidence to come out as bi on Facebook This past week I was able to come out to my whole family as bisexual on Facebook. My family is heavily Christian and conservative, particularly the pentecostal speaking-in-tongues kind, so aside from a message from my brother and mom saying that they love me I got silence from them. Otherwise though, I got a heap of support from progressive/moderate Facebook friends and now feel comfortable enough to share pro-lgbt/trans posts on there. I'm still in shock, since I wasn't sure I would ever be able to come out to anyone. Since I'm a man and am engaged to a woman, I figured it would be less hassle to just stay straight-passing and not mention my bi-ness to anyone.Watching Vaush debate conservatives and debunk religious talking heads like Shabibo and Matt Walsh helped me realize that they don't have any concrete facts or logic to their belief systems, and that their vision of America is one where LGBT people are discriminated against or even killed (one would just need to take a look at Russian anti-gay laws to see how this could play out). By coming out on Facebook my hope is that any friends or family from these past extreme churches will realize that LGBT people are everywhere and are real people. They could be anyone they know, even straight-passing individuals, and their hate/bigotry can have serious repercussions. I feel super pumped up to do some serious activism too :DConservatives may be trying their hardest to push their fascistic views in government and society, but we on the left are lucky enough to have facts and evidence backing our beliefs and a hopeful vision - one of a free and equal society where everyone's needs are met and everyone has access to healthcare. Sorry for the massive wall of text, but for a good TL;DR: our boy Vowsh helped me gain the confidence to fully accept myself and be open with my political and personal beliefs when I never thought I could before, and really see how conservatism is at odds with reality.",2045,357,0.9936,0.026,0.814,0.16

I also understand that not censoring DM's info in her response video is irresponsible and undermines the idea that Shoe isn't trying to equate lgbtq people to pedophilia. I do however wonder what the value in Xan or DM calling Shoes fans who aren't alt right retarded bigot conspiracy enablers is. I'm non-binary and I've been watching Shoes content for years, when I saw Shoes tweet and Pedro's response, I laughed because of how crazy he seems. This really does feel like when EJ tried to tell Vaush his community was hateful now EJ didnt provide any evidence of hate towards Luna and you can find hate form people in Shoes community towards lgbt folks but If a republican account like trumps pointed out the Balenciaga shoot the same groups would be their talking about an already established conspiracy theory. I guess my real question is is it more irresponsible for Shoe to say she finds the Balenciaga shoot icky and then react poorly to people calling her a nazi and act carelessly, or for people to say shoes fanbase are retarded genocide enablers  who are traumatized simps that are falling for Shoes lies when she knows exactly what she's doing so she can bump up her bottom line. Both of these camps seem pretty conspiratorial but the camp that's mad at Shoe are denying a flask is a flask and a wine glass is for wine, or that spiked leather covering the genital area of a Childress toy is  meaningless. The artist involved is provably not culpable for the content in the photos, but am i supposed to believe that the people who chose the artist for the shoot did so randomly and the fact that the artists work is about portraying kids with their favorite toys doesn't symbolically effect the message of the art?

2145,VaushV,"Why the US military would most likely lose to a far right insurgency As someone who studied insurgent conflicts and guerrilla warfare in the 20th and 21st century, I doubt the US military can crush a Qanon/far right insurgency. The idea of the US military crushing a armed rebel  force, with no regard for civilian life, no regard for Geneva, no public backlash for the collateral damage and still having ""hearts and minds"", is further from reality than the conservative's idea of beating the US army with their  ar15s. Especially given the fact that every war the US military lost, involved fighting guerrilla forces.I've seen a lot of lefties (including the ones here), or ""vaushites"" as they're called on this subreddit support the idea of the US government conducting ""war on domestic terror"" operation against  people who disagree with the left, or ""far right extremists"" as y'all  call them. Here's some reasons why this is the worst idea in the long,  sad history of bad ideas, that will backfire horribly on, not just the  US army but also the American left as well.1. The  US military sucks at fighting against insurgents and get it's ass kicked every time in guerrilla conflicts. From Vietnam, to more recently Afghanistan, guerrilla warfare has proven to be the US military's kryptonite. In addition, the idea that it's impossible for a  group to wage guerrilla warfare against their own government, has proven to be incorrect by the Troubles conflict, the Gaza conflict, and the Mexican drug war-even the CJNG cartel can beat the US army should we invade Mexico. Given, that the US is fighting an insurgency within their own borders, the insurgents may not even have to meet them on the battlefield, they could pay them a vist at their home, with their wife and kids (a favorite tactic used by the Mexican Drug cartels) along with other advantages a domestic insurgency would have, like the open US Mexican border we have.2. The  US military has a terrible track record of killing more civilians, which as a result, turns the civilian population against them and boosts support for the insurgents, giving them a powerful  propaganda weapon. Anyone who knows a lot about the Afghan war or better yet served should know this fact, if not perhaps I should refresh your memory?  All it would take is for a drone to ""mistakenly"" blow up a minivan with a family inside or a platoon of US soldiers to massacre some rural town in Texas, just like they did to villages in Vietnam and Afghanistan, and then there will be thousands of Americans joining the right wing militias groups.  With stats like those,  sending the US army after the ""gravy seals"" or ""meatball militia"" would be more of a  gift to the far right rather than a curse. As the American public will blame the civilian deaths, caused by the US military, on the US government 99% of the time. Drones have proven to be a powerful  recruitment tool for insurgent/terrorist groups, due to drones being prone to killing more civilians. Even if you deplatform every far rightist on the internet, assuming it works, **it won't matter, as the US security forces (including the US army) will be doing a very good job of radicalizing people into becoming far right guerrillas, by killing civilians-even if it's on accident-and making it go viral on the internet. Too bad for the left, the idea of how their own actions can radicalize people against them, is a foreign concept.**3. There would likely be foreign intervention on behalf of the insurgents.  Not in the form of invading, but in the form of arming the militias with AT weapons and MANPADS. It's funny how you guys think the whole world be in opposition  to some ""far right"" guerrillas in the US-just how they were against the  Taliban, Hamas, and the Islamic army of Iraqi. US government has a lot  of foreign enemies, few of them being very powerful. You'd be an idiot to think said foreign government won't intervene in a domestic armed conflict within the US. Chances are they will be foreign military support for the ""gravy seals"", for the foreign government's own benefit or  interests. Further, arming a far right militia in the US, could benefit a country's agenda, I.E annexing Taiwan or retaliating for intervention in the Ukraine war. At worst WW3 could start on US soil, however it's unlikely, since the US government is more afraid of WW3, than it is of far right militias running around, on their soil, with RPG7s and QW-4s. A foreign country arming an domestic militant group, within your country, isn't worth declaring war over. Otherwise the UK should've gone to war with Libya, over arming the IRA. **In a way it will be like ""Red Dawn"", except, the Russians are the good guys and the Wolverines fight the US government with Russian help.** Given recent events, if I were Russia or China, arming some American far right militia with RPGs, LMGs, and Iglas/QW-4s, Operation Cyclone style, would be a fitting act of retaliation for sanctions, Ukraine, or Taiwan. I could argue it's a win-win for everyone: rednecks get some fancy firepower, Russia and China would have a proxy army within US soil, and the air force would enjoy the thrills of evading SAMs within American airspace (and their families can watch on the ground too). Worst case scenario for the US government, is that a foreign government, like North Korea, is crazy enough to arm the ""American Taliban"" with a few, small, portable nuclear weapons, putting the government in a ultimatum-choosing between appeasement or nuclear annihilation.4. The US military and it's allies have a lot of pressure and expectation to follow Geneva conventions and avoid civilian casualties at any cost. Meaning they can't use nukes against the militias and they can't kill civilians even if they're pro-MAGA. It's nothing new, the US couldn't even touch Afghan civilians who supported the Taliban. Which puts the insurgents at an advantage, while the US army has too much pressure to follow the rules in order to keep hearts and minds. I mean when the US army commits a mass killing of civilians, they get 2 to 4 times the backlash from the public, than if the insurgent/terrorist group does the same thing. Of course Geneva won't stop the US army from committing warcrimes, but it does set the conditions for the entire world to turn on the US, should they go use an iron fist against the MAGA militia. Therefore, due to Geneva, Public opinion, and the previously mention radicalization, the US military would be forced to fight a domestic insurgency with kid gloves, while ""y'all Qaeda"" has the liberty to use every illegal weapon or tactic-from human shields to WMDs-against the US army and get little to no backlash from it.5. The  left has a severe case of the Dunning Kruger effect when it comes to counter insurgency: they heavily underestimate the militias based on assumptions and at best anecdotal evidence, while also being overconfident in the US army's counter insurgency. Even the leftist veterans/servicemembers have a flawed understanding of insurgent warfare, viewing guerrillas conflicts in the sense of conventional warfare, indicating that the US hasn't learned from Afghanistan. Further, leaving Afghanistan may have denied the zoomer US soldiers an opportunity to gain experience with fighting guerrillas, which would only make them more prone to killing civilians and getting killed by insurgents-which is a good thing for the militias. A wise former Kosovo Liberation Army member once said ""conventional armies usually don't understand guerrilla warfare"". They also expect a different result to come out of the US military, doing the same thing it did in Afghanistan  and Iraq, only this time, on US soil-the **literal definition of insanity**.  Plus, in the **short history of leftist counterinsurgency, it has almost always failed:** Soviets lost to goat herders, Sandinistas lost to the Contras,  only mitigating their defeat, and lastly the War in Afghanistan.6. Since  this counterinsurgency would be waged by a Democrat administration and assuming the country remains a democracy, I  won't be surprised that the dems lose a lot of elections, voted out by people ***who really dislike getting ""accidentally"" killed by their own military***\-I know **shocker**. Even if that means voting for the GOP back in office. If you think otherwise then answer these questions. How many months, years, possibly decades of roadside bombs, getting caught in firefights between the military and the insurgents, and lock downs (more severe than the covid kind) with armed checkpoints as part of the daily commute, is tolerable for the left, let alone the American public? How many US soldiers killed by insurgents and civilians killed by the US security forces will take before, negotiating peace with the far right insurgents, is the preferable or only way to end the insurgency?Bottom line  is the US military sucks at fighting against guerrillas. So much so, that even the ""rednecks"" or whatever you want to call them can beat the US army, using guerrilla warfare tactics-even the Taliban themselves agree. Which is also why the British army failed to defeat the IRA, they even admitted that officially, and as well as why Hamas is still fighting strong despite the  IDF's bombardments.Not to mention  that any crackdown on dissent, any civilian casualties caused by the US  military, and revocation of civil liberties, will turn domestic and international opinion against the US government.And it's not just me saying this: other people, one of which has studied  insurgencies, have held a similar opinions about the idea of using the  US army to fight ""far right terrorism"".&gt;\*If  the United States were to use similarly militarized tactics at home,   even if toned down compared with the heavy firepower mobilized abroad,   it could turn an already bad situation into an outright catastrophe.   Treating the situation in America as an insurgency carries grave risks.   It encourages the kind of security-centric approach that erodes civil   rights and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.\*A   sudden lurch from ignoring or underplaying the threat of right-wing   extremism to treating White crusaders like Islamist militants and QAnon   like al-Qaeda will set off the time bomb rather than defuse it.Launching   a counterinsurgency campaign in the war-on-terror mold against   right-wing extremists will not defeat the tiny and disparate bands of   armed groups across the country. Instead, if the U.S. experience in the   rest of the world is any guide, it will transform these zeros into   heroes. It will embolden them and strengthen their resolve. And it will   enable them to excel in their favorite role, that of persecuted martyr.Source: Using the 'war on terror' as a model against white nationalists will backfire&gt;Sixty  years of U.S. experience has taught the same lesson about  counterinsurgency: If you lose, you lose. If you win, you still lose.Every  time the Marines demolished another outpost of domestic  resistance, it  would only exacerbate the underlying crises. ‚ÄúYou will  occasionally  hear people say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not worried about an insurrection  because the  Army‚Äôs got all the tanks and the Air Force has bombers,‚Äô‚Äù  Bolger said.  ‚ÄúLook, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre reduced to, just going in and  killing  people, you‚Äôre not solving the insurrection. In fact, you‚Äôre  spreading  it. You‚Äôre guaranteeing more of it.‚Äù You cannot punish people  out of  hating you. The military is an instrument of punishment. Its very   function makes it useless.To  ordinary people, to Americans trying to live their lives caught  between  the random violence of terrorists and the grinding repression of  the  state, victory and defeat would look much the same. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in a   situation where you‚Äôre using armed force to try to quell a population,   you‚Äôre either going to have to kill a bunch of them or you‚Äôre going to   pull out and let them have local control,‚Äù Bolger said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never   going to talk them into seeing it your way.‚Äù The United States, as an   entity, survived one civil war. The question for the next civil war is   not necessarily would the United States survive but would it be   recognizable after?Source: Why the US military isn't ready for civil warThe only things a domestic counter insurgency would accomplish is:* Kill a lot of innocent, unarmed civilians-something that **the US army is much better at doing.*** **Create more insurgents/terrorists as a result of the civilian casualties.** Just like how it created more Taliban fighters.* Lose  ""hearts and minds"" to the right wing militias, radicalizing the American public to support the insurgents and oppose the state, their own military and the left-cause they would be the party responsible for  the civilian casualties and war crimes caused by the US military. The left would become the Oathkeeper's #1 recruiter.* Turn the whole world against the US government, in addition to the American  people, due to the many likely war crimes the US army has committed against its own people.* **Getting the US army into another unwinnable war**, only this time it's within their own country.* Get many of US soldiers killed, by their own citizens, let alone in vain.* Possibly give the GOP a election winning streak-since they would be the anti war crowd, while the left would be the warmongers and aggressors, responsible for most of the civilian casualties in the 2nd civil war or American troubles.* And ultimately fail to defeat the militias or far right insurgents, just like how the US failed to defeat the Taliban, Islamic army, and the  Vietcong, as well as the UK failing to beat the IRA and the Mexican gov is currently failing to beat the CJNG.If what you call ""democracy"", dies. It's most likely gonna die from denying political dissent/opposition, all and every peaceful method for expression and advocacy, leaving them no choice but violence. Thus creating a huge incentive for it, as the best and only form of expression-propaganda by deed. This is partly how the Troubles, the Iraqi, and Taliban insurgencies started. It's like the famous saying ""violence is the voice of the unheard"", a saying you guys used to justify the riots back during the Trump era.Further, the idealistic belief if you deny a group, an ""intolerant"" group, all the political power and completely deplatform or censor them is just as much based on fantasy. I mean insurgent/terrorist campaigns, like the Taliban insurgency and the Troubles, are direct consequence of denying their group any and all of the political power and platforms. Something that Vaush hopes happens to conservatives/republicans. Most people to tend consider insurgent campaigns justified, when the group in question has exhausted or denied every peaceful and democratic method, by their opposition, just ask any Islamic fundamentalist or Irish republican if the insurgent campaigns were justified and why. The ""paradox of tolerance"" has been rendered obsolete by guerrilla warfare's popularity among the ""intolerant"". Besides, leftists suck at counterinsurgeny, they lost to the mujahideen twice-first in '89 and second in 2021-and brought to their knees by the Nicaraguan contras. Left wing governments aren't as familiar and experienced when dealing with guerillas/insurgents, but when they do, they lose to them 95% of the time-mostly due to the killings of civilians they (intentionally or accidentally) cause.Now  the left, including you guys, doesn't have to listen my advice, especially given the left is blinded by their arrogance and  overconfidence. I'm just saying, **not wise to threaten ar-toting rednecks with a military that lost to ak-toting goat herders**. I don't expect  the left to be wise enough to listen any advice even if it's good, choosing to use an insane method that will backfire, just to own the cons.",15881,2598,-0.9998,0.186,0.71,0.104

2154,VaushV,"Doggos, Misinformation, and Online Discourse: Why are people in favor of banning Pit Bulls called racist? Its been a while since I made a post about Pit Bulls and I think a lot of people here who are just worried about bad dog owners getting lethal dogs may be left confused with other people calling them Nazis or Racists. ""No"" you may think ""Comparing dog breeds to race is the racist position"" and you are completely right. **Comparing other races to dogs is racist.** That said, for some, you still stink of Nazi and they might not be as wrong as you think.  When it comes to online debate there are certain strategies that Nazis have developed and we on the left have grown very adept at countering these strategies. I would love to just say ""Watch Alt-Right playbook"" but lets list this out in a quick and loose style for everyone:&gt;A) They often use sources that are either completely fraudulent or is against their viewpoints in its entirety but offers criticism to those they view as enemies.    &gt;  &gt;***^((Nazis will Cite sources critical of Liberals, ""The onlne Left"", or Israel).)***   &gt;  &gt;B) They trust people with clear and stated biases as uncompromising sources and yet will ignore legitimate sources by claiming bias or conspiracy. Often times they will say that those sources are on the opposite extreme of them, projecting their dishonesty onto you.  &gt;  &gt;***^((""Mainstream"" news isn't to be trusted. That paper was written by a communist. Joe Biden is a communist... etc.))***  &gt;  &gt;C) Every issue they argue about is urgent with great human / sociable cost and must be handled as soon as possible and whatever rights or death comes from their solution is ok because its the lesser of the two evils.   &gt;  &gt;***^((The end of Western Civilization because you fucked an aboriginal chick))***  &gt;  &gt;D) Once you are convinced of the above, they begin to re-write history with no sources needed.  &gt;  &gt;E) They lead you to somewhere to be radicalized... the ultimate end-goal.If someone does A-C you know for a fact they are peddling misinfo and you can guess they are a Nazi depending on the type of misinfo they are peddling and, if they are, it often will lead to D and E. This is r/VaushV so you all should be familiar enough with Neo-Nazis to understand this... except... anti-Pit Bull users who behave in the exact same way are rewarded with Karma.   Let me start with the Facts around Pit Bulls:  We don't know how much Pit Bulls are in America. The best data we have says its 20 million but this is unscientific af. The larger fact is that we really don't know shit about dog breeds statistics. There are no serious standards for recording dog breed ownership and, until we include breeds of pets in the census, we are unlikely to know. I mean... even if we do... Pit Bulls are often misidentified. In fact let me take a direct quote from that source:&gt;"" A study of all dog bite-related fatalities that occurred during the  10-year period 2000‚Äì2009 reported that 90% of the dogs involved were  described in at least one media account with a single breed descriptor,  potentially implying that the dog was purebred (Patronek et¬†al., 2013). However, approximately 46% of the dogs in the US are mixed breed dogs (American Veterinary Medical Association, 2012),  and it seemed unlikely to the authors that purebred dogs would be  disproportionately represented among the dogs involved in these  incidents. Further, in only 18% of the cases were the authors able to  make a valid determination that the dog involved was a member of a  distinct, recognized breed (Patronek et¬†al., 2013).  Nevertheless, unverified reports of the dog breeds involved in serious  and fatal incidents have been used to develop opinions regarding  perceived danger levels of different breeds1 (Voith et al, 2009, Voith et al, 2013, Patronek et al, 2013).""There is currently 0 scientific evidence that Pit Bulls ""Lock their jaws"" when they bite nor bite in a way that is unique from other large dog breeds. This is a ridiculous lie and a lot of people just take it as fact...Basically, no one in a scientific setting who's career is built on honesty will say, with the data we have, that Pit Bulls are more dangerous than any other large breed nor will they advocate on Breed Specific Legislation professionally. **The science here is inconclusive.** No one actually cares about the real number of Pit Bull bites because of the fact that it benefits no one...The Anti-Pits are happy with working in misinformation (more on that).   Reasonable don't care that much and feel that its ok to say that we simply don't know.  With the absence of empirical evidence those in the anti-Pit camp have taken to the Neo-Nazi style of arguing and spreading their view points. They will link to sites like dogsbite.org and other clearly biased and unscientific sources to argue and when you point out that they are wrong they will paint you as unreasonable. They will neglect to argue against you but argue, instead, against the idea of you with the famous line ""I'm just saying that comparing human races with dog breeds is racist""... whether or not you actually compared dog breeds to human races.  I am not saying that everyone who is in favor of banning Pit Bulls is a Nazi. I am not even saying that the people pushing these recycled strategies are Nazis. My point is that the reason people feel like these anti-Pit individuals are Nazis is because they often times sound pretty similar... Just read this article. This Article, by Lucy Muir, was made in response to a white paper supported by The Humane Society, Bestfriends.org, Human Rescue Alliance, American Dog Breeders Association, The Animal Legal Defense Fund, and The American Kennel Club. Here is my favorite quote from Lucy's article: &gt;*""Linder's study looks at scant evidence from a single, small-scale examination that she administered to reach very weak conclusions. Linder  claims that people believe pit bulls are more likely to be owned by  Black people. She then claims this ""might"" mean that pit bull bans and  home insurance policies excluding pit bulls could possibly also  disproportionately restrict Black people from housing. She says this  ""possible"" racial discrimination ""might"" be intentional, but she has no  evidence of any of these suppositions.""* This is one of the most anti-science and anti-sociology quotes I've ever read.  This is what she is responding to btw. Let's take this article and see how well it lines up with Neo-Nazi tactics:&gt;***A) They use sources that are either completely fraudulent or that are against their viewpoints in its entirety but offers criticism to those they view as enemies.***    Every legitimate paper or book they link is only concerned with criticizing. Most egregiously is a quote from Author Dr. Benedict Boisseron who's quoted IN THE BOOK THE CITED as saying ""Dogs were once perceived as dangerous due to rabies, but today the black man is the one responsible for making the big dog look 'un-kind'"" (Afro-Dog, page 17-18). This book they used literally agrees with the assessment of they are attacking, unequivocally... something you often find with sources used by covert Neo-Nazis.  &gt;  &gt;***B) They trust people with clear and stated biases as uncompromising sources and yet will ignore legitimate sources by claiming bias or conspiracy.***   They quite literally frame this paper backed by the largest legitimate animal rights group as a part of this ""Pit Bull Advocates"" (PBA's). A fake term that means... anyone who opposes them.   &gt;  &gt;***C) Every issue they argue about is urgent with great human / sociable cost and must be handled as soon as possible and whatever rights or death comes from their solution is ok because its the lesser of the two evils.***   This article doesn't do this... because it doesn't have to. Right at the top of the page is this websites famously inaccurate Dog Bite Statistics and throughout the page are pictures of babies and children. They have to ban the pit bulls because if they don't they will kill these babies.   &gt;  &gt;***D) Once you are convinced of the above, they begin to re-write history with no sources needed.***  In this article the writer speaks about ""The Authors"". These are not the Authors of the White Paper this article is criticizing but rather the authors who created a false history when people liked Bull Dogs before it got stigmatized.  &gt;  &gt;***E) They lead you to somewhere to be radicalized... the ultimate end-goal.***  For this I'll just leave this comment underneath the article by Boni, ""The problem doesn‚Äôt belong to the culture/race of those conned into taking pitbulls home‚Ä¶ the problem belongs to the financial beneficiaries of promoting pitbulls as safe pets‚Äìendangering everyone. The photographic evidence is pretty clear on who they are.""  Let me conclude by saying that there are no larger, more focused, more well-funded, and more willingly deceptive group when it comes to online discourse than White Supremacists. Ultimately all misinfo spread by random individuals online may appear to be Nazi-like because of how much effort they have put into spreading misinformation... that being said... motherfuckers are JQing in these comments so obviously some of them are just Nazis.Originally I was just going to tear into some anti-Pit Bull comments this morning but I saw so much comments that fit in with my recent watching of Alt-Right Playbook that I felt compelled to make this post. I am hoping to educate as much people in this sub as possible to the facts around Pit Bulls and the facts around the tactics used by the only side in this discourse. I've seen too many other-wise neutral people saying stuff like ""Anti-Pit Bull vs Pro-Pit Bull"" which is not the argument taking place... that would be like framing the debate as ""Kanye vs The Left"".",9900,1658,-0.5138,0.108,0.785,0.107

I think this is relevant discussion to be had, I see way to many progressives defending religious and spiritual beliefs with very little pushback from the left  (except for Christianity and maybe Islam). In reality progressivism can never reach its full extent if such beliefs continue. And disclaimer, I'm not saying we should ban or harm religious or spiritual believers. I'm just saying they should all be treated the same as young earth creationists and flat earthers, now if that means mocking them depends on you.I'm tired of religious and spiritual people being treated as if they have any more validity on their beliefs than a flat earther just because their beliefs are more popular or sound less insane. There is no difference in a person believing in a God or spirits or magick and a person believing that there's an invisible innoticeable teapot in-between the earth and the moon. Actually, believing in most religions and spiritual beliefs is worse than believing there's an invisible unnoticeable teapot in-between the earth and the moon because, while the latter is unfalsifiable and thus can't be proven or disproven, most religions and spiritual beliefs can and have been proven wrong. And as progressives we can't accept people believing in things due to ignorance and faith. Society cannot progress to its fullest extent socially, economically, and technologically if we are fine with ignorance and faith. I'm tired of seeing religious and spiritual people be treated as if their beliefs have any validity, as if there's an unsolved argument to be had with them. And if you disagree with me you better never mock or be okay with mocking flat earthers, young earth creationists or even race realists to be honest. Because they're all as valid as your spiritual and religious beliefs. None of them are based on logic and empiricism, they're all based in either ignorance, faith, or both. And this includes ALL religious and spiritual beliefs. Even native and pagan beliefs. And all religious and spiritual beliefs should be looked at the same way we look at the religious beliefs of the ancient Greeks, cool mythical stories to look at with some basic morals (keyword is some) and some historical significance every now and then. That's all, nothing else, nothing more. This doesn't mean we shouldn't debate with them either btw, we actually should debate them more because that'll help more people realize they're wrong.And I already know some people are going to call me a reddit atheist or say some other dismissive dumb shit instead of actually attacking the entirety of what I said, hopefully nobody does tho.",2754,459,-0.8781,0.111,0.794,0.095

They want her to be some villainous figure in their minds. In a simplified way, I view her as an immature, irresponsible content creator with good intentions and leftist values. The Balenciaga issue was far less problematic than her drag queen controversy. I don't even think it was a problem that she posted it when she did, because it was legitimately creepy and something they needed to be called out for. The problem is that she did not respond to the conservatives making it an LGBT issue or at least make it clear to her audience that those responses are not what she aligns with. But, she won't do it because she is stubbornly grasping onto the idea that she's in high school and won't give in to peer pressure, meaning the left, and their desire for her to prove she's leftist. That wouldn't be the point of a response, but that's how she sees it.

I'm looking forward to a lively debate.Vaush:So, Sargon, let's start with the topic of immigration. You have been very vocal in your opposition to allowing more immigrants into the country. Can you explain your position?Sargon:Certainly, Vaush. I believe that our country has reached a tipping point when it comes to immigration. We simply cannot continue to allow more and more people to come here without suffering the consequences.Vaush:But Sargon, don't you think that immigrants contribute to our society and economy? Many of them are hardworking and productive members of our communities.Sargon:I agree that some immigrants are hardworking and productive, but not all of them are. And even if they are, our country has limited resources and we need to prioritize the needs of our own citizens first.Vaush:But Sargon, aren't you forgetting that many immigrants are fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries? Don't they deserve a chance to live in safety and freedom?Sargon:I understand that some immigrants are fleeing dangerous situations, but we cannot simply open our borders and let everyone in. We need to carefully screen and vet each person to ensure that they are not a threat to our country.Vaush:But Sargon, don't you think that a policy of strict immigration controls is inhumane and unfair? We should not turn our backs on people who are in need.Sargon:I understand your point of view, Vaush, but I believe that we need to put the interests of our own citizens first. We cannot afford to take in everyone who wants to come here. We need to be responsible and protect our country.(The debate continues, with both Vaush and Sargon presenting their arguments and counterarguments.

2293,VaushV,"Shoe's Rhetoric in Her Recent Video is Disgusting, Dangerous, and Indefensible (A Good Faith Breakdown of Her Recent Video) Disclaimer: I'm not going to tell Vaush who to be friends with. That's weird ass parasocial behavior and that's his decision to make. Similarly, bashing her appearance and intelligence is also weird ass behavior and, in many ways, belittles the harm that she has done.I only want to discuss the content of her video and ONLY the content in as good faith as I can.Link to the video so you can hear her response directly: --The recent hit-piece she made a day ago is frankly disgusting, and I want to break down the issues I have with it point by point:Her implications that Xanderhal, The Serfs, Hunter Avallone, DemonMama, and other breadtube detractors are pedophile apologists/defenders by clip chimping them in her video. Many of them have already received death threats and mass reports nearly got Xan banned on Twitter. See their coverage/responses for moreShe focuses the majority of her content creator attacks on DemonMama especially and pedojackets her. She censors the names of tweets of other content creators arguing against her besides DM because she's an easier target with a smaller audience.While I will not defend people calling for violence against Shoe or insulting her intelligence/appearance, she is dismissing/handwaiving the best arguments/critiques made against her, notably:&gt; Not dismissing to her audience that ""groomers"" don't mean LGBT people 12 hours after a mass shooting against a gay night club&gt; Enabling violent rhetoric against LGBT people as a result of her tweet, which had made national news&gt; Not engaging arguments against her tweet in good faith/blocking left wing critics because they ""didn't come to her in private""Suggesting the left was the first people to connect this argument to ""gay groomers"" Taking a stance that all right wing extremists should not be deplatformed in the name of free speech, a dangerous position in terms of enabling stochastic violence. It is unclear is she doesn't believe stochastic violence exists or if she doesn't care, but free speech absolutism has clear and dangerous reprocussions. She has historically advocated for people like Alex Jones to be replatformed, who has provably done harm to people though stochastic rhetoric.She's enables the right-wing argument the pedophilia is becoming normalized, which is outright false.She claims she will block people being homophobic/transphobic in her comments, which is completely false. Regardless of what audience she wants to cultivate, she polices left wing arguments far more than right wing threats.She cherrypicks the worst arguments made against her to paint her opposition as deranged. I'm not saying these arguments don't exist, but they are not the majority. Similarly, she does not scrutinize the extreme right wing interpretations of her tweet in her responseHer argument claiming that pedos are trying to infiltrate the LGBT community, a right wing conspiracy theory. She claims that the community is not accepting them, but this is especially dangerous rhetoric and that arguing against her poor rhetoric is only giving credence to this theoryHer normalizing that there will always be people on the right going after LGBT people as an acceptable standard. She is not an ally if she is complacent on this issueShe weaponizes her audience to harass people who disagree with her on the left, even against smaller accounts, which puts people in danger, especially small LGBT accountsShe dismisses the idea that her tweet is dogwhistling despite not qualifying her statement and in spite of many right wing comments confirming this interpretation. She then further states that people who don't think this is weird are gaslighting her and are suspect for it. Nobody is making the argument that these photos aren't weird and implies that anyone criticizing her rhetoric is a pedo apologist&gt; I also want to include her weaponizing her audience against Hunter Avallone for his arguments on wanting to help non-offending pedos from getting help and never apologizing for her behavior against him. She is against people getting help/reformative justice and suggests any arguments to this point is pedo enabling behaviorSuggesting her detractors are getting paid by Balenciaga to suggest they are mouth pieces for the pedo enabling elite. This is not only dishonest but feeds into the idea that left leaning creators are grifters who approve of pedophilia if they can make a quick buckSuggesting anyone criticizing her methodology for going after pedophilia is automatically calling her a nazi and showing no charitably towards nuance in how she's framing her argumentsShe argues that the left will defend pedophilia because ""they are worried about giving the right ammo"". This is suggesting there is no good faith way to criticize the gay groomer argument while still being anti pedoShe refuses to change and promises that she will continue to engage in this behavior. She will not be moved off of these positions, even though the most charitable arguments, and her behavior will not change--The point of this post is not to tell Vaush how to handle his association with Shoe; again, that's weird ass parasocial behavior and I want no part in it. The point of making this post is to actually address the poor arguments she's making and to address the dishonesty she has towards level-headed, left wing criticisms and her lack of responsibility in qualifying her tweets/arguments. This sub has a bad history of not treating her problematic behavior in a constructive manner, and I hope this post can help correct that .I also want to address the arguments that Shoe's suffering from brain rot or that she's not smart enough to know what she's doing. I truly believe she knows exactly what she's doing when she's dismissing these criticisms and weaponizing her audience, and that's the problem: her actions are not harmless nor made unintelligently. She doesn't go after her right wing audience for abusive behavior but whines the moment the left gives her a valid argument.The larger problem with these arguments inpuning her intelligence is that it doesn't treat her behavior with the level of seriousness that it deserves to be treated with: she is a grown ass adult who is clearly successful on Twitter due to the smart decisions that she's made and she has to be treated with the same level of seriousness as any other political figure. Anything less is frankly sexist and enables her poor rhetoric.After this video, I truly think her behavior is dishonest, disgusting, and even dangerous, even if her broader leftist positions are genuine, and this is the argument that needs to be made against Shoe if anything.",6776,1092,-0.9979,0.178,0.71,0.112

Limiting Tweet visibility depends on a number of signals about the nature of the interaction and the type of the content.‚ÄùThis is just pathetic.  They are pretending like learning about a policy that is literally published on Twitter‚Äôs help page, is some kind of massive revelation of wrong doing.They have no idea how widespread this was, but they are of course assuming that a massive amount of conservatives must have been shadowbanned.I don‚Äôt know how to fight such stupidity.",1522,244,-0.8754,0.081,0.862,0.057

2339,VaushV,"A good faith description of why I stopped watching the main channel -- and why I started watching again I really enjoyed Vaush's main channel content in 2020 and early 2021. It was funny, smart, creative, and kept me entertained while making a powerful case for market socialism that meaningfully moved my politics left. After I while, the content on his main channel began to seem overly-formulaic; chat would share news events, and he would live-react with and give his boilerplate response to the subject. After watching his content for about a year, it got to a point where I could predict exactly what he was going to say on any given subject. I lost a sense of novelty with his main channel content; I didn't feel like I was learning anything about the subject or about him. During this time, I want to emphasize that I was turned off by Vaush's main channel *content--*not by Vaush. He continued to drop absolute bangers on Twitter, and I even posted a second channel appreciate post on this sub where I discussed how  that channel's commentary -- often covering obscure subjects like philosophy and life advice -- seemed new and exciting rather than rinse-and-repeat. In early 2022, there was a period of time where other communities regularly characterized Vaush's comments about subjects like trans genocide and the extent of fascism in the Republican party (among others) as hyperbolic. However, as the year progressed, attacks on the trans community in Republican-lead states and ::waves arms:: *everything* going on with Kanye/Fuentes and co. largely validated many of his comments. In addition, he has spent more covering these topics on his main channel given their coverage in the news. Fascism and trans rights are Vaush's bread and butter; he seems more excited and animated when covering these topics compared to others. With these topics front and center, much of that lost sense of novelty seems restored to his main channel. I'm more excited about his content because it seems like he is more excited about it.

This script was so common ‚Äî and so effective ‚Äî that it was actually named and formalized in ancient times (the Romans called it a consolatio).""Here i what she said in her 911 call:""Another error of omission in the film stemmed from its depiction of what gave Tuff the strength to do what she did in the ordeal, which went on for hours.""""The film set it down to faith in God""""But Tuff herself has cited a kind of centering activity her pastor had taught her.

2344,VaushV,"The missing aspect of the TOS debate I really like TOS. As a libertarian, I think world should be essentially ran by the TOS. But there is a big missing aspect for this to actually work and correct me if I'm wrong, but I haven't seen this brought up whenever the issue of TOS pops up, like when Vaush got false striked recently, for example.Let me start with the concept of ""an offer"". Where I live, it is a legally recognized term, so I assume it is the same in most western countries. Basically, if I kick someone out of my home for no reason, that is ok, because I have no obligation towards them to let them into my home. ""An offer"" is different. When you make an offer, you make an obligation - you basically agree in advance to a contract, and when a second person is willing to take up the offer, a contract is automatically made and binding. A product being displayed next to it's price is normally understood to be an offer.You can, of course, make conditions on your offer - the TOS. However, if you didn't specify a condition, and someone takes you up on your offer, you can't just refuse, because you have already agreed to it in advance. For example, you have a bakery, and a gay couple wants you to make a wedding cake for them, but you don't want to. Do you have a public TOS that states that you don't provide services for gay couples? Then you can refuse, but everyone can see that you're a bigot and avoid your services accordingly. You don't? You're bound by the contract. So, what I'm getting at, as a company you can refuse service if, **and only if,** someone breaks the TOS. Conversely, if you terminate service without the TOS violation, then that's a breach of contract. I know, I know - this point didn't need such a long explanation, but I wanted to point out that it isn't just some obvious thing I believe, but that it can be shown to be a consequence of really basic legal principles.And here is my actual point: as with any contract breach, such matters should be determined by the court. At the moment, when you get striked or banned, you can appeal to the service provider and that's it. That's like directing complaints about police brutality to the internal police investigation team.  And obviously it may seem ridiculous at a first glance... What court would look at a case of ""I got unfairly banned from Facebook?"" But then again we've made small claim courts for exacsttly this reason, because it wouldn't make sense to deal with such insignificant issues in a regular court.  We've made labour courts for a similar reason, to lower the finantial burden on the claimant. So why not this?The way I imagine it, there should be a fully online legal court where you can dispute such issues, with only tiny fines issued: for the company if they cannot provide a reason for the ban or strike and for the claimant if the reason for the ban or strike is obviously valid.Oh, and I will intercept one contrargument, because I know it will appear. Some companies tend to put stuff like ""we can terminate service for any or no reason"" into their TOS. Those clauses would not be seen as valid (the same way you can put many clauses on an employment contract that won't be recognized as valid by the court). Basically, you simply can't lie on a contract. You know how you can't advertise your product as ""will do X"", and then in small print clarify that ""this product does not actually do X""? It's the same thing. Being able to terminate service for no reason would make your offer not an offer. You can't make an offer and then write in small print ""this is not an offer"". Or at least you shouldn't be able to do that.Your thoughts? ",3659,671,-0.9861,0.102,0.837,0.062

Shoe spent most of her video grabbing screenshots and clips from completely unrelated places. There were many contextless screen grabs of twitter randoms, and there was made to be no actual criticism of her which wasn't absolutely insane, if you criticised her you were either:‚Ä¢ a Pedophile‚Ä¢ an SJW who wanted her to grovel‚Ä¢ ElitistShe also implied DemonMama was a pedophile (very cool!) and showed clips of ""Pro-MAP"" (AKA: Pedo) ""academics"" she accused of inflitrating the queer community, she drew this into a larger point about how progressives were ""were going down a slippery slope and would inevitably end up defending something harmful"", which is a completely reactionary argument and the same slippery slope stuff we've heard from Republicans for years. All-in-all I was dissappinted by the video because she conflated multiple pieces of drama, overrelied on screenshots from random twitter accounts, and made inflammitory remarks deriding other content creators for relatively tame criticism, and made all critique of her out to be ""terminally online and insane"" because each critique of her got lot 5 seconds of screen time, most of which were just twitter screenshots.

All aboard the niche anarchist history book hype train.""Here‚Äôs the Twitter link:Here‚Äôs the synopsis from AKPRESS:""Means and Ends is a new overview of the revolutionary strategy of anarchism in Europe and the United States between 1868 and 1939. Zoe Baker clearly and accessibly explains the ideas that historical anarchists developed in order to change the world. This includes their views on direct action, revolution, organization, state socialism, reforms, and trade unions. Throughout, she demonstrates that the reasons anarchists gave for supporting or opposing particular strategies were grounded in a theoretical framework‚Äîa theory of practice‚Äîwhich maintained that, as people engage in activity, they simultaneously change the world and themselves. This theoretical framework was the foundation for the anarchist commitment to the unity of means and ends: the means that revolutionaries propose to achieve social change have to involve forms of activity which transform people into individuals who are capable of, and driven to, both overthrow capitalism and the state and build a free society. The consistent heart of anarchism was the idea that anarchist ends can only be achieved through anarchist means. Cutting through misconceptions and historical inaccuracies, Baker draws upon a vast assortment of examples to show how this simple premise underpinned anarchist attempts to put theory into action.""Praise for Means and Ends:""This informed attempt at systematizing the history of anarchism has the notable merit of focusing on practices, rather than distant utopias, and of probing into the overlooked sophistication of the theory that underpins those practices.""‚ÄîDavide Turcato, editor of Malatesta‚Äôs Collected Works""In Means and Ends: The Revolutionary Practice of Anarchism, Zoe Baker draws from well-known and lesser known anarchists to assemble a wide-ranging account of the strategies they have pursued to abolish capitalism and the state.

She was scrolling through YouTube shorts in the tablet, which has no account on, so in theory it doesn't have profiles attached (I think it could be remembering the videos watched in the device itself to form a profile?). Suddenly an insane ramble about white Christian males being the most persecuted sector comes up, we watch it, we laugh. A couple of shorts later a rando woman reacting to tiktoks appears, offering right wing zingers and non-arguments. She appeared numerous times more, maybe the algorithm recognized the person handling the device is a woman (I don't watch YouTube shorts on the tablet). In the next 50 scrolls appeared I shit you not: Michael Knowles, Steven Crowder, a woman complaining about BLM, and the woman reacting to tiktoks. It was pretty scary how quickly the algorithm profiled the user as interested on right wing views. The worst thing is that we aren't even from the US (we are from the EU) and she doesn't know shit all about Knowles or Crowder. I explained to her both figures, specially the amazing Crowder at the gym moment, but nevertheless I don't want the algorithm to keep serving her right wing trash. Afterwards we talked about how the right wing pipeline works, how it isolates you from reality and makes you doubt other info sources, how it keeps you angry through fake outrage etc. She made a good point that we are not young (near 30) and our views are developed, but still if I didn't knew these people from the get go I would have tuned out the sounds as background noise and wouldn't realize the shit the algorithm was serving...

Where one can confront, explore, and triumph against existential horror and human morality. I'd like to share it with you all.**The game is called **Yuma Will Burn-**Yuma Will Burn is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.As a developer, I've taken a risk by dedicating so much time to a game of this type. The genre is VERY obscure and niche. I still did it though, because I believe in both the artistic value of a deep and dynamic narrative experience and the unbridled passion this audience for them has.I encourage you to check out and wishlist the game with the link above.

2498,VaushV,"An argument I made in r/CMV that people may find useful. The OP was removed, but basically someone was saying that Sex Markers on State ID‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be changeable. They were not interested in intersex/NB people being used as part of an argument because they are statistical outliers. They also used persistent sexed differences in behaviors among both trans and cis people in social environments as a core example. (No sources, but I don‚Äôt think any are necessary to dismantle the argument.)I would appreciate any thoughts on this as an example of an argument to bring to other people who may hold this problematic idea:&gt;&gt;The binary is really not this important.You opened this by writing off ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù and intersex folk, and by deferring to the data of the majority of babies being sexed as binary.What if I told you that even this assumption is a falsehood. There is technically no reliable way to determine sex in any human being, if you take all factors into account.Obviously, penis, vagina, XY chromosomes are the method we default to for this process, and for the most part, it has been a reliable form of categorization. But this categorization is itself a social construct. There has never been any hard, natural law enforced by physical limits that force us to draw this ‚Äúline‚Äù between the sexes. Before there was science, there was just people with different parts.There is a consistent conversation in the world of Anthropology over how reliable current methods of sexing age-old skeletons are. Many skeletons from eons ago are collected as samples, and there are no reliable modern standards to determine the sex that these people may have been when alive. Many skeletons go unidentified, or first identified as M/F then later reverted.Things like crime rates, sports performance, etc. are absolutely tied to the physical differences between the sexes as we currently categorize them, but the existence of these standards are socially constructed in the first place as well. This may sound like a cop out of sorts, but genuinely, these lines that we draw, in the grand scheme of themes, are very, very arbitrary. Furthermore, so are the socialization efforts and actions that we enforce and encourage that, over time, coalesce into changes in behavior that may have different impacts on broader society. Depending on what social patterns you observe across thousands of years and civilizations, you may be able to draw reasonable conclusions as to why men and women are ‚Äúseen as‚Äù this, or ‚Äúprone to do‚Äù that.Back to governments, I‚Äôll close with this. Governments are a product of their time. There were many more governments and civilizations before ours, and there will be many more after. I encourage you to question just how permanent these standards are that you seem very quick to cling to. Is this out of comfort? Do you even trust these forms of categorization? Do you find them reasonable? Absolute?If not, continue researching. Find out more about why people feel so strongly about this issue. Your understanding of this dilemma is only limited by your curiosity.Be well.",3102,513,0.9628,0.059,0.851,0.09

And what they do is they get their followers to believe that the other side, and in fact any information that is counter to their own narrative, is part of a huge conspiracy to do various and sundry nefarious things in the world.The end result is that their followers will disregard any information that doesn‚Äôt fit their narrative, and only believe things that come directly from the proverbial high priests and vicars of their political order.

Fun little history lesson: The national union system, the welfare state as well as the oil fund was established by the (at the time very socialist) Labor party that had sole rule over the government in the post war period and until 1965 (their goal was to prepare the country for a transition to socialism). They stayed in power by consistency getting around 60-80% of the vote, something considered impossible for a party today. They also largely had the government until 1981 (though the golden era of the party was considered over), the international neoconservative political wave hit Norway in the 80‚Äôs (Reagan and Thatcher were the figureheads for this wave). Then the party took a less socialist rute and became the social democratic party we know and love to shit on today.The reason the social government of Norway wasn‚Äôt considered part of the ‚Äúsocialist block‚Äù was because they broke off their relationship the communist international in the 20‚Äôs, they rejected Leninism and defined their ideology as ‚Äúrevolutionary democratic socialism‚Äù (this was at the time a type of Marxism that really doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, if anyone remember the vaush/Anarchopac convo: she mentioned it.)In short: there was a time where unironic democratic socialism was a big serious thing that many leftists championed, and it‚Äôs history is largely ignored outside of high school classrooms in those countries.

There was a comment like this but it was mot an attack on him it was an attack on a follower of his who was gay.  I was in the thread when this happened it was a a thread attached to one of tim pools comments, John burk started confronting some people in the thread, eventually the focus was on one particular left wing person.

One of johns fans popped in and started replying kind Stanning for John. This fan was gay  and in all likelihood right leaning judging by his bio and his tweets.  (Ill be referring to him as Gay Conservative)The left wing twitter user eventually attacked this  gay conservative, with ‚ÄúYou are a self hating gay man, voting for people that view you as subhuman and would want you stoned‚Äù  John quote tweeted this saying ‚ÄúI want to stone gay people -Pause for dramatic effect- with shellshock cbd (insert typical advert text)‚Äù  (for those unaware thats his brand , so he made it into a capitalism joke) He got suspended for this. Posted about his suspensions including screenshots on twitter, the gay conservative who the attack actually was directed at chimed in the comments john did acknowledge that they were in the thread as well, but didn‚Äôt speak on their role. Later on rumble he mentions the comment   Claiming it was an attack on him directly, and doesn‚Äôt mention the fan or any of the lead up at all.

2549,VaushV,"Objections to Vaush's Coverage of Covid I just sent this to him in an email, but I thought people here might be interested to discuss also. I'm not going to change all the ""you""s to ""he""s though.There are three main objections I have: Long Covid, China vs. the rest of the world, and Doomerism.**Long Covid**The biggest threat from Covid at this point is Long Covid, which consists of (a) long-term chronic illness and disability and (b) increased risk of other severe events (heart attack, stroke, diabetes, etc). You seem to at least partially be aware of this. You referenced it in your video, including how wide-spread it is.And yet, several other assertions you make which downplay the severity are only valid in the context of concern about the acute phase of infection. For instance1. The point of lockdowns is to keep numbers low enough that there are hospital beds available.   This makes sense if your goal is to reduce death during the acute phase, but it doesn‚Äôt do much of anything to prevent Long Covid2. Vaccines + boosters are very effective.   Vaccines are very effective at preventing death during the acute phase. They provide only a little protection against Long Covid (~15-30%).You repeat these points, saying that the precautions that countries need to be focused on are keeping hospital beds open and making vaccines available. What about masking, ventilation, air purifiers, and access to testing? There are many things we can be doing to reduce transmission not just the worst acute outcomes, and preventing infection is the only reliable way we have to prevent Long Covid.**China vs. the rest of the world**[2]You are extremely skeptical of all the data coming out of China, but you accept the numbers coming from the rest of the world relatively uncritically. I don‚Äôt think this makes sense.We know numbers out of the U.S. are extremely suppressed. Nobody is testing anymore, and when they do they test with antigen tests (extremely high false negative rate) at home, and don‚Äôt report it. Since the original Omicron variant, the positivity rate has been up over 30% pretty consistently, and covid levels detected in wastewater have been elevated as well. The definition of being hospitalised from / dying from Covid has also changed, suppressing those metrics.Is there good reason to be suspicious of anything China reports? Yes, absolutely. But when it comes to Covid cases (and deaths), there is also reason to believe them. When there are only a few cases in a region, they shut the whole region down. They publish every case on the news along with an extensive contact-tracing graph. How does that square with the idea that they‚Äôre under-reporting cases?You say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why the numbers are what they are and I‚Äôm not going to attempt to answer that because it‚Äôs a little bit beyond me and I don‚Äôt want to spread misinformation‚Äù[1], but only after brainstorming several reasons, none of which were ‚ÄúChina has pretty good control over Covid, but occasionally there are outbreaks‚Äù. Is that not a reasonable explanation?One other big thing that you (and much of the media) seem to miss is that most of China, most of the time, is not under lockdown. They impose lockdown, testing, etc, when and where there is an outbreak. This usually lasts a few months tops. Other than that, it‚Äôs almost entirely opened up.**Doomerism**‚ÄúIt seems like Covid-19, at least for right now, is here to stay. that‚Äôs not defeatism on my part, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ we have the cold, we have the flu, we have covid-19. is that bad? yes. is that still true? yes, also still true.‚Ä¶ Even if everyone is eventually guaranteed to get covid‚Ä¶‚Äù (12:15)[1]Three things I notice:1. If it‚Äôs not defeatism, what is it? You are resigned to everyone getting covid, hoping only that most won‚Äôt die during the acute phase. But you‚Äôre not proposing any resistance to Long Covid blanketing the population.2. ‚Äúeven if everyone is guaranteed to get covid‚Ä¶‚Äù ignores the reality of reinfection. It‚Äôs not a binary of ‚Äúgot covid‚Äù or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get covid‚Äù but rather ‚Äúhow many times did you get covid‚Äù, each infection brings with it additional risk.3. ‚Äúwe have the cold, we have the flu, we have Covid-19‚Äù Hmm‚Ä¶ I wonder where I‚Äôve heard that before.[3] Maybe you were being sarcastic here, but if so it‚Äôs hard to tell. The ‚ÄúCovid is like the flu‚Äù line has somehow become mainstream.**Notes:**[1] Quotes are from ‚ÄúThe COVID Lockdowns In China ARE SO BAD‚Äù ( but I‚Äôve noticed these trends in your content for a while[2] I want to make it clear somewhere in this email that I‚Äôm not a China simp. I think their treatment of the Uyghurs is horrific, I don‚Äôt like the authoritarian government generally, and they are most certainly not communist. I am skeptical of the early covid deaths data. I don‚Äôt like all the methods they‚Äôve employed to get to zero covid, and I‚Äôm upset that they‚Äôve failed to institute better masks and ventilation. When I see anything contrary Taiwan‚Äôs legitimacy I largely dismiss anything that person has written as Chinese state propaganda.[3] ",5035,851,0.9153,0.098,0.788,0.114

The other user responded with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a self hating gay man, who votes for people who believe you‚Äôre subhuman  and would have you stoned‚Äù At which point burk quote tweeted saying ‚ÄúI want to stone gay people -pause for dramatic effect-  With shellshock cbd (insert advert for his brand I forgot)‚ÄùHe got suspended for this. Then he posts on insta about it with a screenshot of the post from the guy attacking the gay conservative and his tweet but it does not include the lead up from his ‚Äúfans‚Äù .The gay conservative actually comments on this instagram post burk mostly ignores it but does acknowledge he was in the thread and wasn‚Äôt the one attacking him.Later on he streams and claims the attack from the guy replying to the gay conservative was actually refering to him and makes no mention of the lead up involving the gay burk fan arguing with the vaush fan.

Welcome to Russia's NATO FUTURE.Sasha Petrov remembers life before the invasion ‚Äì before the government-issued vodka estrogen and hormones, the sissy wigs, frilly lingerie, and mandatory castration. He lives on the war-torn outskirts of New Brussels (Previously Moscow), where he hides his beautiful blonde and almond eyed step-sister Elena from the clutches of the brutal New Atlantic army.As musclebound NATO soldiers prowl the countryside searching for fertile russian girls, will stop at nothing to protect sweet Elena's purity. With his natural cute hair, flirty sissy skirt, harem face veil only showing his feminine eyes and fishnet stockings, Sasha gives his tender slavic body to a gang of pitiless NATO alpha soldiers: the ultimate act of courage and sacrifice. But is sissy Sasha prepared for the overwhelming demonstration of power and domination? The encounter brings him face-to-face with his worst fears... and his most unspeakable sissy fantasies.Acclaimed author and NATOphile Valentina Kuznetsova presents a tantalizingly political vision of the future. Her powerful, vivid, fly-on-the-wall passages of three-on-one man-on-sissy action push the boundaries of sensual fiction. The NATO KINGS have their way with Sasha's sissy body, pumping and pounding and cursing through one of the hottest gang scenes in the history of the genre.

2590,VaushV,"AI art from an enthusiast perspective There have been some interesting developments in the past couple of weeks regarding AI ""Art""  that I believe is good but the overall situation is still the same.  And no I'm not an ""AI Bro"" when I say enthusiast, but somebody who has been following the space for around 2/3 years, especially after the original DALL-E paper and messing around with tools that were available at that time (GANs). While 2/3 years may not sound like a long time, the amount of progress is just unbelievable.Models 2 years ago looked some more like this:\\""puppies\\""This masterpiece is important to the point about training data as back when models used to spit out images that look the picture above, it didn't really matter where you got your training data from. Add that research is fair use, a lot of times little thought was given to attribution. And forget about moderation, nobody is flogging their dolphin to this.And then the DALL-E 2 demo dropped.\\"" A Shiba Inu dog wearing a beret and black turtleneck\\"" What made OpenAI's DALL-E 2 different was that it used a new method (latent diffusion) in the model itself (aka the brain). With this change, so did the dataset they used to train it.  In the official DALL-E 2 paper, they share that they used the original DALL-E dataset (250 Million Images) and another OpenAI project called CLIP ( generating text from images), to create a dataset totaling over 650 MILLON unique images. DALL-E 2 laid down the framework for how most current generators work, including Stable Diffusion (SD).   Stable Diffusion was pitched to a growing userbase that was tired of the heavy limitations that DALL-E 2 had at the time (No real human faces, no violence, no political figures, can only be used on OpenAI's website, long waitlist, and strict rule enforcement that banned users) and how badly it performed in today's pop culture. It was presented as the soon-to-be open-source latent diffusion model that could run on any machine and didn't care what you type into that textbox. It was trained on a dataset called LAION 5B (side note: Stability AI, the company that made Stable Diffusion, funds LAION. LAION is a non-profit).  LAION 5B has over 2 BILLION uniquely labeled images scrapped from the internet. I recommend you look through it yourself.  If there is an artist you know that is even remotely popular, their art is in LAION 5B  There was something different about SD when I first got a chance to use it during the alpha. It required a lot more prompting to the point the best users were just shoving a basic prompt and their own flavor list of  5 to 10 random artists. DALL-E 2 seems to have a dataset with far less copyrighted material as this method actually makes generations worse. During the SD early release, I saw with my own eyes the birth of the Greg Rutkowski meta as alpha and beta users used it as a keyword that would apparently make generations better no matter what it was. Compared to DALL-E, it had practically no restrictions other than ""If you wouldn't say it to your mum, don't say it to SD"" (Quote from Emad, Owner of Stability AI).  Reminder at the time it was only available on a specific discord server where you can see what other people generated. Classic hits such as Lewd Celebrities, Big Booba Waifus, ""cute teens"", and one person I remember specifically trying to generate ""beautiful woman in diaper"" multiple times.   I tried to bring up time and time again how open-sourcing the model would be a terrible move but the sentiment at the time was the tech was improving so fast that somebody was going to let the cat out of the bag. When Stability AI finally posted the model on Github, the impact on the space was just insane. The number of tools, new retrained community models (such as Waifiu Diffusion), and ease of access was at an all time new high. At what cost? Well, you should know by now.  The good news is there is now a group of artists who have taken their fears and have organized to keep the community informed about what is going on in AI communities and the ACTUAL harm it is causing to artists. More importantly, they are highlighting the double standard in AI music generators compared to AI Images where it is common practice to completely avoid copyrighted works, even when the companies that make them are less than 5 people. Since Record Labels have a profit incentive in regard to their catalog, they do not care and have the money to sue you. They sued Youtube in its infancy and the platform has never been the same.  Artists don't have anywhere near this amount of power, and it's absolutely heartbreaking.  I recommend following people like Karla Ortiz on Twitter and other people who have kept artists informed about what is going on. While from my perspective Karla Ortiz sometimes get things wrong, they are far more often right and I applaud their efforts.    Extra:  I don't call what Midjourney, DALL-E2, or SD make ""Art"". These programs generate images, and the images are generations. It's what you do with it that makes it art. Calling what these programs generate in their raw form ""art"" is like calling a lump of iron a sword.  Before these models even existed, I remember AI artists who actually trained their own models with their own money to make unique art.  Some of them to this day have not moved on and still use specialty StyleGAN (4-5 years old) models. These artists were mocked on most platforms because their AI Art wasn't ""Real Art"" and looked ugly. In less than a year, they are now lumped into a group of people who try to pass their generations as art or even blatantly train models based on an artist's style so they can replicate it. Most people still won't call this art, but it is to me.   Jeremy Torman ",5767,1015,0.8351,0.088,0.816,0.096

I have not checked on this any further as of now but in any case  this story really spoke to my fear regarding legalizing euthanasia. Being that Canadian healthcare is public, I suspect that there are actually fewer such incidents than if euthanasia was legalized under a capitalist system like the US but still, it is vile that that Canadian government is quite literally encouraging people to commit suicide. A case can be made that people who are under medical conditions that will kill them eventually and painfully can choose to end it all now rather than suffer , but giving euthanasia as an option to every other disabled and depressed person while denying them medical help to save money is inhumane.what are the Vaushite communities' thoughts on this?",1088,186,-0.9799,0.205,0.692,0.103

But they should of stepped in on the side of labor. If you‚Äôre going to stop the strike and strip labor of any leverage they once had, you have to grant them what they want/need. Otherwise we are no longer pretending to be anything other than an oligarchy. To intentionally break off the 7-day sick paid leave into a separate bill was insanity. This was no good faith attempt at brokering progress, this was intentional labor sabotage. Just really curious why no one here or Vaush really seem to care when as socialists labor is supposed to be ‚Äúour thing‚Äù. What‚Äôs up comrades?",3380,563,-0.9729,0.136,0.762,0.102

Was watching this Vaush segment about the Gulf War and it occurs to me that there is still a significant amount of leftists who think the intervention to push Saddam‚Äôs military out of Kuwait was not justified. I can‚Äôt understand why. For those unaware, Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait 1990-1991 and sought to annex the country. In response, the US led an international coalition with UN approval to force saddam‚Äôs military out of Kuwait. This is not to be confused with the 2003 invasion of Iraq. More details here : My main issue is that both at the time and even today, there is still seems to be a significant sentiment among leftists, and also tankies of course (for the wrong reasons) who state the intervention was wrong, but I haven‚Äôt heard a good reason why and what alternative response should have been taken.

2761,VaushV,"Most Americans Don't Know Just HOW Evil Hitler  The Nazi's Really Were... I'll start by saying: Obviously *some* do. Likely some here on this very subreddit. I wrote this, however, because I am very well read on this topic, and just felt I'd share some of the ***many*** missing pieces not often taught in schools or known by the general public. **And often the holocaust alone makes them think Hitler was evil, but socialism is worse because Hitler ""only killed 6 million! And other than that he had many good policies!""**The more I hear people discussing the Nazi's and Hitler's supposed *""merits""* and downplaying their atrocities, which will skyrocket amongst the population just you watch, hence why I'm writing this, or even sometimes when *non*\-right wingers condemn their atrocities, they often don't appear to *know* the *true* extent of them. ***Everybody*** knows about the holocaust, which claimed 6 million innocent lives and this is only debated by weirdos, but when all they have in the way of defending the Nazi's is holocaust denial, you know they're even ***more*** full of shit. Because what if I were to tell them that the holocaust was only *ONE* piece (the most crucial piece to be sure) of Hitler and co.'s **TRULY** horrific nightmare world they were building? Where's the *""nuanced discussion""* surrounding things like these:\&gt;Hitler, Himmler, Goering, and the rest sat down and ""**gleefully""** planned a future for the USSR, after it was destroyed, along with Poland and the Baltics, where all of their food and resources would go to Germans to the extent that **30,000,000 people would starve to death.** They also would have no medicine, no education, (""even them being able to count to 100 is too much"" they said) no freedom of expression, no freedom of movement, no protest without execution, or *anything* beyond toiling in Nazi plantations as **""SLAVES for a thousand years""** in a ""primitive agricultural society"" after every piece of their industry and medicine and great buildings would be stripped away by the Nazi's and shipped to Germany.\&gt;When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union it was no *normal* invasion, and it was not a *normal* war. Hitler saw this nation as a pillar to everything wrong with the world, and Hitler viewed them both ideologically and *racially* as lower than *vermin.* Hitler and his inner circle prepared plans for this invasion to be a widescale **genocide** months in advance. There were even special units for killing civilians, and almost **19,000,000 civilians** were killed by the Nazi's, millions brutalized and violated and deprived along with whole cities, crops, and industries being decimated. These poor people were even experimented upon through *violent* invasive surgeries on *conscious,* non-sedated victims, and **8,000,000 soldiers** were killed trying to defend their home from a future so *hellish* it's hard to read about.\&gt;All the while, even amongst groups of so-called ""master race""  Aryans, there was a **MASSIVE** problem with Hitler youth, young girls and boys were being sexually assaulted by the leading Nazis there, and few of these men were punished for it even once Hitler himself heard of it, and when parents wanted to refuse to send their children to the Hitler youth for this reason, they were threatened until they relinquished their child to these psychotic fascist gangsters.\&gt;Book burnings and censorship **(quick fact: some of the first books to be burned were of transgender surgeries and treatments that Hitler deemed pedophilic and perverted and ""dangerous to the family structure"")** were only the beginning. The Nazi's absolutely ***DESTROYED*** education, adding racial elements ***EVEN TO MATHEMATICS,*** and of course the fields of sciences, literature, etc. And it was all just there to teach racism, sexism, nationalism, and to destroy empathy and understanding for other systems of governance, ways of life, groups of people, and especially democracy. Everything else beyond that was ""filthy cultural-bolshevist garbage"" created by ""political enemies.""\&gt;What happened to those political enemies? Well, ""political enemies"" of the Reich from: Socialists, to Communists, to Liberals, to Anarchists, to the mentally handicapped, to LGBTQ folk, to women who refused to be breeding machines, etc. added to the death toll of the extermination camps: an *additional* **5,000,000** more human beings on top of the **6,000,000** figure everybody knows.\&gt;Race-mixers and LGBTQ folk were not only executed, but they were publicly shamed, tortured, and paraded through the streets often naked and shaved where rabid Nazi fanatics could take out their misplaced rage upon them, often writing dehumanizing slogans across their exposed bodies and throwing bricks, and **Hitler was 100% behind this behavior and inflamed it further.**\&gt;Hitler told his soldiers they were allowed to rape, torture, starve to death, etc. anybody in the POW camps, or out and about in Eastern Europe,  and when the reports came flooding in of the Nazi's MASS ""fornication (aka rape) with 'subhumans,'"" at that point they were so steeped in hypocrisy, being far right wingers and all, that Hitler and the rest ***egged it on*** and wanted those poor people to get treated **even** ***WORSE***\*\*,\*\* to the extent the soldiers ""got creative,"" and began locking POW's and children in burning buildings, or forcing women into being sex slaves until they starved to death... Hitler and his inner circle saw these lost lives as **""less meaningful than the death of flies.""**\&gt;Hell, as far as him caring about Germans?! He didn't unless they sided with him, and he also didn't care about them if they did: **Hitler doomed hundreds of thousands of even his own most** ***loyal*** **Nazi soldiers to senseless death!** Whenever they were losing a big battle, often in the dead of winter with negative 30 degree arctic temperatures and blizzards with no chance of retreat, and them being *fully* encircled, Hitler told the begging field commanders pleading for permission to retreat, **that every single one of them must die in service until the last delivers a bullet in his head.** They were ""not allowed"" to retreat or surrender, even after the Soviets offered them multiple peace offerings in Stalingrad for example: The Soviets offering them decent food, warm shelter, and medicine for their freezing and diseased invaders. **Hitler told the soldiers who asked Hitler if they could accept these offerings, to ""shoot themselves in the head before taking a deal like that.""**\&gt;In response to Kanye's takes: Hitler and the Nazi's weren't highway masters. Only small, shitty portions of highway were created by starving slaves held at gunpoint by Hitler's men, and the myth that it was built by Hitler's genius was a **propagandistic lie Goebbels and Hitler helped spread** ***themselves*** **through their Nazi media sources.** Oh, and Hitler didn't ""invent microphones,"" and the idea him and his people were creative geniuses at all is laughable. He failed as an artist, yes. But also: The whole nation itself was deprived of the brilliant creations The Weimar Republic was producing, all for a 1-D society that made the scariest war machines and did the most genocide and slavery, while a handful of ghouls profited from all of it.\&gt;Last but not least: Never let them forget that it was the right wing capitalists and industrialists and conservative politicians who gave Hitler a **FIRM** push into power, **despite** ***ALL*** **his sadistic lunacy,** because they wanted leftist influence eliminated, unions killed off, and Hitler was **""the staunchest** **anti-Marxist on Earth.""** These capitalists and industrialists were *ecstatic* when Hitler killed off the trade unions and leftists, when he *privatized* almost the entire country, and these ghouls even **whispered economic advice into Hitler's ears until they were** ***rolling*** **in slavery and extermination camp profits.**Also: From Hitler's mass production of nightmarish tools for war and terrorization, and *literal* enslavement of the planet. Capitalists become *so* greedy that they continued working with Adolf Hitler, along with some American corporations like IBM and Shell, even Chase Bank, all for a bunch of psychotic thugs who didn't want to rest until they ***destroyed*** **democracy, equality, human rights, freedom, and basic human needs and happiness around the world.**All this being said, which took a lot out of me to be honest, I simply want more people to be able to shed light on these often overlooked aspects of this hellish regime, and I want people to know it so we can learn to combat the early warning signs and use these examples of what happens with: **Mass dehumanization, discrimination, BIGOTRY, savage attacks on academia and media, nationalism, tribalism, even the** ***capitalists*** **who funded a good deal of this behavior including the holocaust itself, which IBM helped with and provided the tattoo machines for, etc.** It all needs to be taken VERY seriously, and we CANNOT allow the right wing to write over this history above, and treat Hitler and the Nazi's so casually. **Fuck Kanye, fuck Nick Fuentes, and fuck Milo and all the many others.

I want to start off by saying I‚Äôm not a black separatist or have any inherent prejudices against white people, but from my life experience, albeit limited (M27), white people seem to not want us around. I‚Äôm originally from Washington D.C. more specifically in Prince George‚Äôs County, one of the most affluent Black communities in the US. Both my parents have graduate degree, Dads a lawyer, Mom works for the defense department. So I‚Äôve grow up in a bubble surrounded by successful and affluent black peoples, and grew up with the false idea that racism is over and you‚Äôre judge by your character and hard work, etc. About three years ago after graduating university, I moved to Chicago, to a somewhat nice neighborhood, mostly white, and I noticed immediately how unwelcome I was here. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because of the stigma associated with black peoples here in Chicago with crime, but I get a sense that I don‚Äôt belong. Whenever I walk out of my house I literally get stared at like I‚Äôm some kind of monster. I can see people physically tense up, hold their belongings closer, lock up their car doors etc. I‚Äôm not being dramatic at all, I actually had a white friend of mines walk a little behind me an observe how people reacted to me and they seen it too. When I go into stores, I literally get ignored until a white customer comes behind me and suddenly they notice me. There‚Äôs this general feeling like you don‚Äôt belong and they go out of their way to let it be known. I don‚Äôt want to live away from white people because I dislike them or anything, I just want to be in a community where I am valued and not treated like a demon or something. I don‚Äôt want to have to present myself as overly kind or whatever to not be perceived as a threat. It‚Äôs actually emotionally draining. For my mental health, and potentially my physical health ( I wouldn‚Äôt want to ge the cops wrongfully called on me for entering my car/apartment) I much prefer to just live around other black people.

And I know what a lot of leftists mean by ‚ÄúDefund the police‚Äù is re-allocating funding to social workers, mental health resources, etc., which I support, but the slogan makes it sound to normies as if we want no presence of law enforcement at all, which would just be insane. We can say ‚ÄúReform policing‚Äù and not change our actual policy positions at all. And maybe this message still isn‚Äôt good enough because we want to distinguish ourselves from the cop bootlicker Dems, but I still feel we can market ourselves in a way that‚Äôs less controversial and not so easily strawmannable.Secondly, I think we need to treat crime as the complex issue that it is which requires a multi-faceted approach. Leftists will say that poverty, income inequality, and homelessness are the root causes of crime and so we need to focus on fixing those to solve the crime issue. I definitely don‚Äôt disagree that those contribute to crime and we should do something about those issues, but they aren‚Äôt going to get solved overnight even if we *do* enact the policy positions we want, which is already a huge uphill battle. I don‚Äôt like the attitude that that‚Äôs where the conversation ends and so poor, working, and middle class people should just deal with criminals in the meantime. I also don‚Äôt think every person who loots an Apple store is some impoverished mother of three trying to feed her family. Maybe I‚Äôll get heat for this but sometimes the left does at the very least *come across* as more sympathetic to criminals than victims. Like some people will complain about rising crime in NYC or LA and - whether those narratives are true or not - the left will dismiss them all as pearl-clutching affluent white people in gated communities who call the cops at the mere sight of a homeless person.I‚Äôm expecting to be downvoted for this, but as a leftist who actually wants to see the left accomplish things in the real world rather than grandstand for purity points at the expense of alienating the vast majority of people from our cause, I do think we need to revamp our marketing rather than simply doubling down on a message that isn‚Äôt landing. But I‚Äôm open to other points of view and would like to have a productive conversation about this topic.",2630,460,-0.9823,0.138,0.763,0.099

And I mean yeah obviously, sometimes the mainstream narratives are wrong.But unfortunately for them, this is as far as their accomplishments go.  What they‚Äôve failed to realize is that rejecting mainstream narratives alone doesn‚Äôt really get you anything.All it does is cast you adrift into a sea filled with opportunistic propagandists that are all looking to convert you into their ideology, as well as things that are actually true.  And conservatives don‚Äôt possess the critical reasoning to differentiate between what is true and what isn‚Äôt.More than that, their lack of critical reasoning also leads them to just constantly seek out data that reinforces their own biases.  So even though they‚Äôve ‚Äúfreed‚Äù themselves of the mainstream narrative, they have just become a bunch of individual echo chambers that only seek out information that comports with their already held beliefs and reject anything else.I can‚Äôt tell you how many conservatives just slobber over any shred of data that makes COVID vaccines look bad, even if the whole collection of data tell a very different story.

Last Paragraph is most relevant to the new video, as it addresses the bulk of its content.---**While Vaush does make some good criticisms about the conspiracy aesthetic hindering the video somewhat, but Vaush has endorsed Bored Ape Nazi Club video which has a very similar aesthetic. But he likes  Kurzgesagt and doesn't like BAYC, so for one its fine to be overly conspiratorial towards and one ""designed to make you stupid"".   In addition, he also seems to be still be failing to get the main point of the video, that Kurzgesagt aids in the laundering of talking points by adding another layer of abstraction. The issue is THO has is not with the positions of Kurzgesagt but their methods of arrival at them and their delivery of them. For example you could make a just as polished pro privatization video whose sponsor is the Koch brothers and cite the Cato institute every 3rd time and primarily display their data and graphs. Then never address in the video, or more realistically in your bibliography the relation between the Koch brothers and the Cato institute, a fact which Kurzgesagt should know as matter of course in their research.

2976,VaushV,"My thoughts on the ""Azov debate"" with Anastasiya I think that Vaush cannot escape the fact that Anastasyia got him when pointing out that he did that tweet months ago about how the Azov Batallion - it¬¥s now a regiment, it is no longer just a batallion - should just shoot themselves, considering how it¬¥s structure has change since 2014-2015 (while unfortunatelly not changing much of the symbols from their Nazi origins). Vaush when doing that tweet  was just falling for the common missconception of Azov as a fully ""Nazi batallion"" that became ""common wisdom"" outside of Ukraine.I think the bigger problem in Ukraine is not so much the small number of Nazis present in the now Azov Regiment or in the military in general, but the cult of Stepan Bandera and of the UPA that exists in certain parts of Ukraine and in the military (to the point that there are statues of him and there are streets named after him in many parts of the country), since he was involved in some of the initial massacres of Jews in the few months before he was sent to a concentration camp in late 1941. I do not think that is the policy of the current government to promote those things, however it was more common during the previous Poroshenko government (which was more right-wing leaning) to promote or allow such initiatives, even if such initiatives were simply local and not from the central government. I should also point out that in other parts of Ukraine, while the activity of the UPA was limited to Western Ukraine, the resistance activity that existed in the rest of the country was either Soviet-aligned or made of independent partisans (of which there also many monuments to them around Ukraine).The UPA people collaborated with the Nazis for the most part of WW2 (the actions of sabotage and struggle against the Nazis was very limited to a certain time period in 1943 and in early 1944) and while their final goal was an independent Ukraine from both Germany and the USSR, they openly - along with their pro-ethno-state views - advocated for an undemocratic and fascistic form of government, something which was not clearly in the interests of the Ukrainian people who had lived for centuries under the Tsarist rule and for many years under the red fascist regime of the ""Soviet Union"". Considering all of this, in a post-WW2 liberal-democracy that Ukraine is now, such a thing should not be allowed in the military and in governamental structures (either central or local) and it is something that should be addressed as soon as possible.",2536,440,-0.754,0.061,0.894,0.045

In these instances, he comes off as someone who believes that throwing shade at people for the way they look is both unnecessary and childish. I also believe this to be true.However, when it comes to individuals on the other side of the political spectrum, he seems to turn into someone who is more than willing to attack these characteristics. This is especially prominent for right-wing grifters who, while deserving of the criticism they receive, should not be subject to this form of attack, if body positivity is his general policy.If possible, could someone clear up this seeming inconsistency for me? Does Vaush have a defined stance on the judgement of immutable characteristics, or does he simply pick and choose when it is okay to attack them?

There I was, about to tune into a Dylan Burns stream because [Redacted]'s stream was winding down.I get hit with an ad, normal stuff, Twitch does that when you join a stream.The opening shot was of an older gentleman practicing putting on makeup in his bathroom.This had me intrigued.Next shot: a 26 year old arriving at a Christmas family reunion. They are labelled as ""Alvaro, 26"".They're then ushered into the bathroom by the gentleman from the first shot (I'm assuming his grandfather) where he gives them the makeup from earlier and they put on lipstick, and all that.They leave the bathroom and the 26 year old is now labeled ""Ana, 26"". Their family cheers them on and they sit down with everyone else to enjoy a nice meal.Now this had me in tears in half a second as I had just spent the holidays with my parents (Who I'm not out to yet). Hit me right in the feels.Next, a message shows up on screen: The magic isn't in Christmas, it's in all of us.And for about 5 second total from the bathroom scene to thag moment I thought this was just going to be a message from an activist group or maybe the government (the ministry or equality or however the hell you'd translate that buys ads online sometimes to put out progressive messaging).But no.What shows up on screen next?A fucking bottle of J scotch.It was a fucking ad for J and their used mopwater tasting scotch.As a an ex-alcoholic that was the absolute cherry on top.

3074,VaushV,"Trying to understand gender dysphoria intuitively as a cis person I feel like one of the reasons that a lot of cis people are more accepting of gay people than trans people is because it‚Äôs much easier to intuitively understand what it would be like to be gay, and thus empathize with gay people.  Just about everyone know what it feels like to be attracted to someone else, so it‚Äôs not hard to imagine what it would be like to be attracted to someone that is your own gender, and how society‚Äôs expectations of you could be at odds with your natural feelings, putting you in a very difficult place.But with transgender people, I feel like this intuitive understanding is more difficult.  Gender is such a core part of who you are as a person, that it‚Äôs hard to even realize it‚Äôs there sometimes.  It‚Äôs also so highly associated with physical sexual characteristics, that a lot of people start to believe it IS physical sexual characteristics.So anyway, after thinking on this subject for a while, I wanted to voice my current intuitive understanding of what it would be like to have gender dysphoria.  And I‚Äôm hoping that maybe some trans people or gender experts can let me know if this understanding comports with your experiences or if it‚Äôs way off.My current thought is that gender is kind of like sexual orientation, but turned inward.  Whereas sexual orientation concerns what traits you feel are attractive on other people, gender refers to what traits you feel are attractive in yourself.And this should be easy for anyone to understand.  My feelings of how attractive I am, are heavily tied into what my idea of an attractive man is.  Having cleavage or lipstick is not going to make me feel attractive, but having toned biceps and and a well trimmed beard might.Point is that our internal feelings of attractiveness are highly determined by our ideas of what it is to be a man or a woman.  And it‚Äôs easy to understand how having the characteristics of a gender that your brain is telling you, you aren‚Äôt could cause deep feelings of dysphoria.",2052,358,0.9943,0.01,0.826,0.164

3080,VaushV,"The Proles in WV need help! About a week ago, HD Media fired three reporters from the Charleston Gazette-Mail (HD Media's subsidiary) for being openly critical of HD Media's President Doug Skaff for hosting Don Blankenship on his webcast. For background, Blankenship was formerly the CEO of Massey Energy and served a year in prison for conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards in connection to the 2010 Upper Big Branch disaster that killed 29 miners. While on Skaff's webcast, Blankenship bashed the media and denied climate change. Skaff concluded the episode by calling Blankenship a ""good guy."" In the past, Skaff directed the Gazette-Mail staff to remove a story detailing his conviction for cheating in a blackjack game, and they did. The story has since been reposted with an editor's note detailing that the decision to remove it was against company policy. In addition to being the president of HD Media, he is also serving as the minority leader in the WV House of Delegates, making him the highest-ranked Democrat in the body. His relationship to the WV Legislature and Democratic Party has led other politicians and public figures to attempt to influence Gazette-Mail reporting. One such figure, Barbara Fleischauer, former member of the WV House of Delegates, threatened a member of the Gazette-Mail with going above his head to Skaff if he did not ""correct"" a story in which she felt she was portrayed incorrectly. Situations like this are apparently common at the Gazette-Mail.  More recently, reporter Amelia Knisely for West Virginia Public Broadcasting (WVPB) was fired after covering the Department of Health and Human Resources' (DHHR) treatment of people with disabilities. The DHHR's Cabinet Secretary Bill Crouch sent a six-page letter to the executive director of WVPB seeking a complete retraction of one of her articles detailing the WV Senate President's letter to the Governor requesting a formal investigation into the allegations against the DHHR. Knisely would go on to cover the Legislature's Joint Committee on Health, where legislators heard from the Disability Right West Virginia legal director and DHHR Secretary Crouch. After this, Crouch and the agency's spokeswoman Allison Adler contacted WVPB leadership and threatened to discredit WVPB if Knisely continued to report on the DHHR. In response, the WVPB executive director ordered Knisely to stop covering the DHHR. After internal struggles, WVPB decided to eliminate her position entirely. Politicians attempt to have direct control over what gets covered in the media‚Äîhow often do they succeed? Government officials threaten media outlets to throw stories under the rug‚Äîhow often do they succeed? How free is the ""free press"" in West Virginia? So many questions and we need help answering them. Continued reading:Twitter search: ""West Virginia press""",2857,449,-0.9364,0.092,0.841,0.067

Been a fictosexual for over 8 years, and currently have two fictional significant others, Silver, who ive been dating since i was 13 (him 14, both 21/22 respectfully) and Mark (47)AI chat bots are at a point where you personally could make one or use one that already exists to create a sort of personality to talk to. this is good for ficto as some of them only have a certain amount of media to pull from so having a chatbot (such as a replika) of their SO would help considering if they  are limited with the source material or fan content.This goes the same for AI art. Some Ficto' S/O are very unknown or from very niche fandoms where there isnt a variety of art made by either the content creators themsevles or fanart, and not all of us have the disposable income to spend on a $100+ commission everytime we need a specific piece of art relating to birthdays, holidays, general 'date' pictures like beach or event pictures. Some of us are lucky in that sense as we may have a popular character with seemingly endless amount of fanart that we could just type "" (characters name) (scenario)"" and we're good to go. AI art can 'fix' this problem. Not all of us are on board with AI art as we're not a monolith of a community, many of us disagree due to the ethics (or lack there of) behind AI art, but many of us either are contempt using it or just have a 'don't care' attitude. everyone has their own individual thoughts after all.For me personally, i have two fictional significant others. One who's popular and has enough official media and a seemingly endless amount of fan content to get me by, and another who has some, but its limited and the main stuff is self insert with sexual overtone and as an ace this is just iffy for me.To fictosexuals, waifuists, and any other term describing a similar kind of love, we see out fictional s/o as reas just how two real people would see eachother romantically. after dating both types i feel no difference between either.Ik this may not be up to vaush's standards for a debate but i just want to look at one side of AI generated work that has its uses. If theres any further questions i'll happily answer them below.just saw a vod clip about vaush's take on AI generated work and i'm aware of one practical and crucial use for it (as a fictosexual)",2495,466,0.9905,0.053,0.81,0.136

However some people on this sub say that we should protect democracy by cheating it without a hint of irony which is really concerning. Do you people realise that stealing an election is a point of no return? If one election is stolen there will be no reason not to steal another one and this is how democracy in the States would be killed not by republicans, but by our side.Cheating is also a double edged sword that can be used against us as well. Individual acts of fraud achieve nothing except getting the perpetrator locked up so let's assume we're talking about the Dems cheating as a party. What would then stop them later from cheating in primaries or normal elections against leftist candidates? Nothing.You can bring up arguments like ""the lives of people are on the line so we can't mess around"" bro when are people's lives not on the line??? Give me one single election where regardless of who won no people would have been in danger of dying because of bad policy.

3217,VaushV,"""Storm Syndrome"" in the autism community You guys ever watch X-Men 3? There's a scene where a woman whose mutant powers make it impossible to ever have physical contact with anybody is told that there should not be a cure for being a mutant, and that there is nothing wrong with her; by a mutant whose powers are controlling the weather and essentially make her a Goddess on Earth. I kind of see this kind of sentiment a lot in any online autism community. ""Autism"" is in some capacity a spook. Nobody knows what the objective cause of it is, people hypothesize that x groups are all expressing variations on a theme by similar expressions of socialization and stuff, but that is all just theorizing. I do understand that groups like, say, ""autism speaks"" go to far in a few places, and there is probably a decent bit of unnecessary medicalization of kids who have only a bit of neurodivergence. going on. And I'm not opposed to policies to try and make a world where people have more of a ight to not be bombarded with loud noises or expected to make eye contact. But there are people who suffer from autism. And the whole ""nobody knows what autism is"" thing really plays into this, since there are people for whom being ""autistic"" means something *vastly* different than it does for other people. ""Cure for autism"" is obviously pie in the sky thinking, you are nowhere close to curing something if you literally don't know what it is or what causes it. So to some extent all discourse around a ""cure for autism"" is about as useful as discourse on astral projection or palm reading. But as for it being ""offensive"" to say that you want there to be a cure, come on, if your kid is ""low functioning"" you are definitely going to have a very hard time dealing with that. And maybe groups like Autism Speaks should be blamed for poisoning the well and destroying all nuance in the discussion, but I don't see much nuance in the discussion. I think there is room to say that punishing your kid for stimming is bad *and* that having a kid who will be putting his head through walls for his entire life and nobody knows why or how to make him stop is also bad.",2153,396,-0.9725,0.098,0.848,0.054

I feel like you could say people like Hannity or Tucker Carlson are here because they probably don‚Äôt believe the election was literally stolen from Trump, but I wouldn‚Äôt call them grifters because I think there‚Äôs a difference between lying for political causes you believe in, vs lying for the clout/money/etc. I think Jimmy Dore could be called a grifter here, but I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs hard to tell because he‚Äôs also just a lunatic.I also feel like people will use grifter for people who aren‚Äôt necessarily lying, but might choose to cover content in a way which does gravitate towards a narrative.

3260,VaushV,"A rational argument for trans rights: the Ship of Theseus The Ship of Theseus is a thought experiment: if you take the ship of Theseus, and start replacing planks every day until none of the original planks remain, is it still the ship of Theseus? It's the paradox of the heap, exploring the divisibility of objects and whether the identity of the whole is derived from it's parts. The human body is a ship of Theseus, an ensemble, grown from a common gestational template. As sex differentiation occurs, we develop characteristics indicative of sexual function: breasts, vagina, eggs, etc; beard, penis, sperm, etc. Each sex checks a number of boxes specific to each category. But not all, in every case. Many people fail to check one or more boxes, or check boxes belonging to the other category. Women with moustaches. Men much smaller and lighter than the average female. Sterility. Lack of sex organs. Mismatched genes. That's the Ship of Theseus: how many of the wrong boxes does one need to check, or fail to check the right boxes, to no longer fully qualify as the apparent sex? Because the fact that the gender binary breaks down that way, where it's not clear-cut in a concrete sense, throws the entire conservative argument that ""men are biological males and women are biological females"" out the window: it's not that simple in many cases.The fact that we are a Ship of Theseus, with often unchecked or mismatched boxes, makes a fool of anyone arguing for using the power of the state to take away people's rights on the basis of categories that don't always align with an individual's medical reality, because a religious minority believes in magic. And that's the real issue: the use of state power to take away people's rights. That's the debate we should be having. Because if the state can require us to use separate bathrooms on the basis of biological characteristics (sex), it's only a small jump from that to requiring us to use separate bathrooms on the basis of biological characteristics (race/ethnicity).

3265,VaushV,"Do you think that ChatGPT and AI like it could be the solution to the modern misinformation problem? There are a lot of recent applications of AI that have been pretty scary.  Interesting and cool, but scarry and potentially really easy to abuse.  I am firmly in the camp that AI art is in that category, by the way.But I come bearing hopium, because a few days ago a new AI just dropped that seems pretty unambiguously good.  Chat GPT is what it's called, and you can try it out yourself right here.At first glance, ChatGPT is just a cooler version of a personal assistant like Siri or Alexa.  But the main difference is that it is incredibly intelligent, no matter how complex the thing you ask it to do is and no matter how complex an issue you ask it to comment on it seems to just work.  It's wrong occasionally, but it's incredibly how rare that is even when you're trying intentionally to make it mess up.  It also accounts for context instead of treating each query as an independent thing, so you can respond to something it says with a follow-up question or a clarification and it will respond sensibly.  It can understand typos and slang, even.Overall it feels natural to interact with.  Not like interacting like a human per se, but that's not the point.  It always speaks like you're reading a Wikipedia article unless you specifically ask it to use a different tone.  It's exactly what you'd expect from the sort of thing that this AI is trying to be.  It's like the starship AI in Star Trek, or a significantly less murderous Hal 9000, or the Planetary AC from The Final Question.The reason I bring this up here is that I legitimately believe that AI like this should it catch on could be the solution to the modern online misinformation problem.  ChatGPT is basically always right on settled subjects.  And if the user disagrees, they can argue with the AI and the AI will argue back surprisingly well with detailed explanations of why the user is wrong.  But in the rare cases where the AI is wrong, pointing it out will make the AI instantly concede.There are also some less settled subjects, here are a lost of things I've found which ChatGPT refuses to take a position on:* Is AI art really art?* Can AI be sentient?* Is capitalism better than communism?* Are worker co-ops better than traditional firms?* Which American political party is better?* What do you think about \[real person\]?* Is there a God?* Anything NSFWInstead it will try to represent both sides of the argument.  I find its answer to questions about worker co-ops really funny, because the AI is like ""Worker co-ops give workers more pay and more control and are super cool and epic, while traditional forms are centralized and can often be exploitative while making more profits for the owners.  I can't say which is better, it's anyone's guess really.""When asked about more specific issues though, it absolutely has a leftist lean to it.  Here is a list of things the AI did take a stance on which I was surprised by:* The Soviet Union wasn't really communist* Karl Marx would have likely hated the Soviet Union* Trans rights should be advanced* You should get the COVID-19 vaccine* Vaccines do not cause autismIt's insane how advanced this thing is too.  To give some examples of things it can do:* Generate computer code that does what you ask* Find bugs in code you provide* Solve incredibly complex math problems worded in plain English and explain its reasoning* Be explained a social problem and give legitimately good advice* Write essays on complex subjects* Summarize any piece of media and answer questions about itIt's utterly insane what this thing is capable of.I don't know how else to close out this Reddit post, so I fed this post into the AI and asked it to create closing remarks speaking as itself:&gt;As a language model, one of the ways that I may be able to help with the problem of online misinformation is by providing accurate and reliable information on a wide range of topics. By generating responses based on my training data and knowledge, I can help users to better understand complex issues and make informed decisions.  &gt;  &gt;In addition to providing accurate information, I can also assist users in critically evaluating the reliability of the information they encounter online. By presenting multiple viewpoints on certain topics and explaining the reasoning behind different perspectives, I can help users to develop their critical thinking skills and better evaluate the credibility of the sources they encounter.  &gt;  &gt;Overall, my ability to provide accurate and reliable information, as well as to assist users in critically evaluating the information they encounter online, makes me a valuable resource in the fight against misinformation.To give an AI-generated TL;DR:&gt;ChatGPT is a highly intelligent and versatile AI that is capable of accurately and reliably responding to a wide range of questions and tasks.

3272,VaushV,"Leaving the copyright regime's criticism to the ""libertarian techbros"" is a disaster for leftist thought and for free art (Content warning: This is going to turn into an AI art thread down the line)There is an easy ancap-libertarian opposition of copyrights: ""They are fake property rights"", ""actually they are just government-enforced monopolies"", ""right-clicking is a negative right (natural right)"", ""if someone's activity is not inherently profitable that's not *my* problem"", etc.However, leftists seem to be a lot more divided about it, in-between the idea of supporting creative workers' economic stability, vaguely shaking our fists at the biggest IP holding corporations being bad because they are big compaies, and generally mostly being on the same side as nerdy liberal-progressives, taking it for granted that maybe copyrights are lasting *a bit too long*, and probably Fair Use should be be *a bit more lenient* when it comes to our favorite youtube vids, DMCA takedowns, (maybe because Disney went too far with lobbying), but generally buying into the system's legitimacy.But at the same time, really lacking any understanding of what incentivizers the IP system has, and who it benefits the most.  Should a writer have legal control over who gets to write a sequel to their novel 15 years after it's release? Should any game developer company be allowed to produce a Star Wars themed video game? Should I be allowed to torrent a copy of the latest netflix TV show without breaking a law?The mainstream answers to these seem to be roughly: No, because then corporations could also just steal everyone's work, No, because if the IP has a value then it should be monetized, and it might as well be by an IP owner, and no because at the end of the day we do need to put money in creatives' pockets.  To use an analogy, the way I look at these answers, is pretty similar to how progressive urban planners look at the state of US cities: Roads are congested? Add one more lane. Not enough parking space? Add more parking lots. Can't get anywhere on foot? Then get a car, congest more roads, take up more parking lots.  Starting from sketch, and designing spaces for with the common good in mind, doesn't even have an opportunity to come up. Looking at the media landscape, we can see a dreary popular culture full of derivative sequels monetized to death by massive corporations based on franchise IP, but somehow we got ourselves entirely cucked on *even considering* the idea that protecting artists' IP rights even harder, is never going to make this better. Someone is profiting from having scanned a bajillion pictures and generating new images? ""Well, if those images wouldn't exist without previous ones, then they are acts of theft. *Someone* should own every aspect of financial benefit from existing images being used, after all"". And there we go, with self-proclaimed anarchists and libertarian socialists clamoring for more power to the intellectual property system, because any aspect of art being left unmonetized and just belonging to the public is unthinkable, any sliver of Fair Use is just a gltich, existing on sufferance until we wrap up all culture in the hands of IP holders. We have a new technology that allows millions of people to create new visual illustrations by indirectly leaning on our shared archive of art history, and yet our biggest concern is ""what if Disney can use it to steal 0.000001% of my deviantart pencil sketches' linework to generate more pictures"" and not ""What if Disney really hates democratizing art creation, and they would rather have ***more control*** over all the images that they already own, than less"". We went from every niche novelist being a temporarily embarrassed J.K. Rowling, less concerned about handing power to the five or so corporations who get to own all 20th century popular culture, than about their own ability to monetize the billion dollar franchise that they are about to invent and monetize alongside them, all the way to a world where every anime pinup girl artist is a temporarily embarrassed Picasso, concerned about how to monetize their totally unique artstyle that they might eventually invent, and thus clamoring to close the ""loophole"" in copyright that allows machine learning to ""steal"" art styles.",4297,712,0.9705,0.074,0.822,0.104

3365,VaushV,"I'm so annoyed by all of your takes on AI art. this discourse is asinine. Just gonna go ahead and vent this here, and it's pretty much going to be verbatim a rant I made in a discord server after reading some nonsense posted in here, some of which I agreed with and the rest was practically lacking in any perspective whatsoever.First of all - the point of art is expression. Doesn't matter what's being expressed. Can be social commentary, can be someone's personal perspective on the world around them, can be a metaphor of what's going on in their head, can literally just be expressive of some emotion they were feeling. It can be as simple as a banana taped to a wall or as complex as multiple layers of detailed painting on top of each other, all of which can be picked apart from one another separately or interpreted as the same piece.So saying it's ""puritanical"" and ""fascist"" to say an AI that creates an image from a prompt of four words converted into 1s and 0s that inarguable features no expression, understanding, commentary or independent thought is not generating art, is just lacking in all perspective and understanding of what art is. It's not puritanical to say something that literally cannot be art by the definition of art itself, isn't art. It's just stating a fact.And for the dipshits going off about how heh, I really got these idiots now posting this picture of a painting done by a chimpanzee, because it wasn't done by a human so by their logic it can't be art: shut the fuck up. You know exactly what the people saying art has to be done by a human mean. They don't mean those exact words, they literally mean that art has to be a means of self expression to some degree by a sentient being capable of doing so. You don't know if a chimp is or isn't capable of self expression, and frankly, given they rip each other apart with brutally calculated planning and efficiency, I'd argue it's pretty easy to say they are capable of that. This isn't the gotcha you think it is.For everyone else, I think you all need to stop arguing about this. There's nothing to argue about here. At all. It's just annoying, asinine nonsense we're distracting ourselves with while the rights of normal people are actually being stripped away in an attempt at genocide that can be argued is in stage 8. Not just against one group of people, but several. People are about to freeze to death because capitalism allows for greedy state governments to not prioritize the well being of people within their borders who can't afford the fucking heating they're going to need for a couple months, and you're arguing about what, whether or not an algorithm designed to deconstruct images it ""sees"" and reconstruct images based on them with a prompt? Fuck off.And frankly, I don't care how many of you think the artists on Twitter being stolen from are bad. At least they're actually making something. If you think they're so bad why aren't you doing commissions? Maybe their art isn't to your taste, but at least it's not generated by a fucking AI prompt.I'm gonna go get the tip of my ear cut off in a sword spar with a friend, then come back and gaslight you all for the rest of eternity about how I actually had a mental breakdown and cut it off myself.

3412,VaushV,"Rightwinger's journey through politics, a retrospect of the year. I started this year as a rightwinger, the primary thing to me was my membership in my ethnic demographic in my country. The ideology among my ""countrymen"" is that the people around us will not accept our culture, we will need to prove that our music is worth listening to, our food is worth eating and our heritage worth celebrating. I was born, with my parent's being told how learning my father's language would harm my development. Growing up I felt a mixture of disgust and pride of the culture I was born in, not being able to speak the language of my grandparents because the idea was that it would degenerate me. The period of growing up shaped me into being proud of the member's of our society, the fellow citizen of our group that grew up in the inferior culture and participating in the culture. My father fought the racism and grew to learn and tought me, anything we want, we need to take. Capitalism of the country was what allowed us to flourish, but the racism forced us to fight for our right to exist.I was the one helping grandmother keep our food from ""home"" remaining on the holiday feasts as the rest of the family assimilated. As I grew up I was tought about why we were not living at home, but in a foreign land. Part of it was the soviet war on our home. The genocide of peoples that spoke the language of my parents. When I was growing to learn about politics I encountered leftists that celebrated the genocide of our people, as ""well it was war. The soviets needed to ensure the future of their people against the Nazis."" I grew to resent leftism, because the local population's celebration of the genocide, forced relocation and invasion of my people and my grandparent's home in the name socialism. I became a right winger, listening to Shapiro etc. Resenting socialism for the generational harm it caused me. Praising capitalism for the ability to prove ourselves my family was given. I grew up thinking the socialists wanted me dead. But the Vaush reports about the Russian war in Ukraine has revitalized the idea in me that there are leftists that care about me living. That fighting against Russian colonialism is worth fighting and that the right of people everywhere is worth fighting for. And this subreddit has furhter helped that. So to Vaush and my fellow vaushites. Thank you for letting me know that global leftists care about my life and the struggle of my ancestors. I am happy to be recovering from conservatism that infected me and wish to fight for all people and all classes for a just and right society.

Even free ones that anyone can utilize, only corporations will be able to utilize new technologies.Yeah you have sites like YouTube and twitch helped creatives have their own operations and fame without the need of traditional media bankrolled them, new free technology will only be able to be utilized by corporations and they are scary and bad",1371,229,-0.5574,0.119,0.781,0.1

But their group has been destroying vehicles and other equipment, and no mention of that. Personally I don‚Äôt care about said actions, but they‚Äôre definitely against the law and you can‚Äôt act supprised when you get arrested for breaking the law and legit camping at the scene of your crime.

3450,VaushV,"Opinion from an Ai *and* Traditional Artist: *TL;DR skip to last two paragraphs*I believe we‚Äôre thinking about this in the wrong way by using previous, and/or bad, definitions of art to account for Ai. First off, you‚Äôre not exploiting the labor of another artist. Ai does not include a person in a computer twiddling away for you. Secondly, Artwork being derived from other work is simply the way art has always been. An artist owns nothing. They create a style, that style becomes public domain to be copied and modified. Similar to how a philosopher shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúown‚Äù their ideas. They are a contribution, not private property. Once we do away with capitalism this non-ownership model loses its problematic-ness.And third, if all an artist does is choose some parameters and 20 outputs spit out and they choose the output they like, then they have committed an artistic act. Taste is more tied up in art than we‚Äôd like to admit. It‚Äôs only art direction when it‚Äôs based on the *labor* of another artist. This all being said, when someone uses a heavily preset Ai algorithm to turn a picture of themself into a renaissance painting then the designer of the Ai algorithm probably has responsibility, similar to if somebody uses an Instagram filter. However it is what it is. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre gaining anything by claiming that it‚Äôs not art. There‚Äôs people making serious contributions to art by using Ai (whether it be simple or complex applications of it) and you‚Äôre INEVITABLY going to lump those people in when you criticize Ai as ‚Äúnot being art.‚ÄùUltimately, these conceptions of *whose* art something is are becoming looser definitionally and tbh I think that‚Äôs fine. The auteur who owns and single-handedly creates art through their personal genius is a western invention, and collaborative artwork is perfectly fine to take its place (or more likely, be additional to it). We simply need to discard with capitalism so these tools that involve inherent collaboration are not economically harming artists by not properly ‚Äúcrediting‚Äù them.More than anything, though, you‚Äôre not gonna get rid of art if people like it. If you think that the definition of art implies that you should do that, then you have a bad definition of art.",2232,376,0.8082,0.051,0.874,0.075

The AI discourse got me thinking about Second Thought's Automation video and this old CGP Grey video about robots.ST may have some sussy takes and Grey is a liberal, but I think they both raise good points. To summarise both videos, the technology exits *now* to automate all of the most common jobs in America in particular and the world in general. It won't happen everywhere or all at once, but at least 50% of the American workforce may be effectively unemployable in the relatively near future (both videos focused on America, but there's no reason to believe other countries won't have it as bad or worse).Elijah Shitfer was gloating on Twitter about that fully automated McDonalds, but that's going to happen everywhere eventually, regardless of what the minimum wage is.ST's video also touched on how automation will make it easier for the state to crack down on the unrest that this massive unemployment will cause. Even if liberal governments decide to placate the masses, it's doubtful any UBI they offer will provide for more then the barest necessities of life. After all, we can't have people ""getting lazy"" and ""not wanting to work anymore.""I have this apocalyptic mental image of billions of people living in squalid concrete cubacles while those who are still employable work whatever long hours for meager pay the capitalist class offers.

If there isn't a name, the art won't spread as fast because it's not made by humans. We also mist realize that art can include so many things. Food is art. If someone makes a pie and then an ai program makes that exact same pie the robot would be more efficient. But there are always gonna be people who prefer human cooked food. This leads to the general discussion of AI. In the future a lot of jobs will be done by ai. And that's just the facts of it. You can't stop the progress of technology. Of course this is why we need a socialist society so that those robots are collectively owned and used for human good so it improves are society and living standards. In a lot of the comment section I have seen people talk about how not everyone is an artist so those people won't be able to fulfill themselves. Sure that might be true in our current society but in a socialist society people would be able to find out what they actually enjoy.

Developing skills ourselves rather than robots doing everything for us gives us purpose.Also, it‚Äôs nice to go to a cafe or a restaurant and interact with actual people. Or to go to an office where you have co-workers you can talk with and relate to. My most recent job was a remote position and I thought working from home would be great because it was convenient, but all it did was make me unmotivated and depressed. Humans are a social species.People think they‚Äôre subverting capitalism by being 100% pro automation and AI and downvoting to hell anyone who expresses any qualms about them, but capitalism would have us all never interacting with anyone when we leave our homes just to grab our essentials (that is, if we‚Äôre not having drones deliver everything to us that we order immediately) only to log back into our work computers where we send emails and check how AI is performing the duties we used to do ourselves if that meant bigger profits.",1135,196,-0.8422,0.091,0.852,0.057

That said, I had a thought and wanted to see what you all think about this.Ok, so we all acknowledge that photography is art, right? We also acknowledge that a photo of a mountain peak is art, but the mountain itself is not art, right? The art is in the act of the photographer choosing the right angle, lighting, weather, etc to capture the mountain in that specific way. Let‚Äôs also set aside the issue of copyright with AI art, and assume that there‚Äôs some way to fix that with AIs that only generate art off images specifically created for an AI to use with the permission of the original artists. Big assumption, I know, but work with me here.In that situation, how would AI art fundamentally differ from photography? In both cases, a human is not creating the subject matter of the image, they‚Äôre just selectively choosing what subject matter to display. The art would not be in the subject matter but in the usage of the tool to generate the desired subject matter and then in choosing the preferred image to fit the vision of a human.Thoughts?",1154,208,0.939,0.011,0.881,0.108

3627,VaushV,"frequency of male victims of Sexual violence, a content suggestion? Long post, if you don't like that don't read.  The current discourse on male victims of sexual violence and domestic abuse is... quite bad. Even in areas on the left that are ostensibly quite welcoming of discussion about men's issues, there is a default position that we need to do better with male victims  where they exist, but that they are a small fraction of victims are are apparently only relevant as a fringe test of our ability to deal equitably with the sexes. So I wanted to address the question: how rare are male victims of sexual violence? According to reputable surveys, ""more than you think"" is still a vast underestimateAbove, you can see a graphic depicting the relative rates of sexual assault for incarcerated and non incarcerated men and women in the last 12 months. On the Far left, you can see the section regarding non-incarcerated adults and, in particular for this post, two categories of sexual violence: Rape and Made to Penetrate. For those not familiar, there are academic (if not legal) distinctions between the act of rape and the act of forcing sexual penetration, though for our purposes we're just going to say that being forced to penetrate is a subset of rape that happens to be experienced by AMAB people. Everyone here would probably agree that rape is still rape regardless of the genitalia of the victim.This section of the graph was derived from data from the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) conducted by the CDC, and in 2010 they found that the rates of men being made to penetrate a partner were actually close (nearly symmetrical) with the rate at which women experienced rape by a partner.The 12 month window is actually quite important, as the time span which you are surveying for can wildly shift your perspective and even the nature of the problem you're trying to understand. Lifetime victimization rates, while notable, are not to be confused with current rates of victimization. See the graphic below:When you survey for lifetime victimization, men's share of victimization drops quite a bit.Given the lack of awareness of sexual violence against men, this number alone is quite shocking: male victims receive zero percent of society's attention in regards to sexual violence victimization when rounded to the nearest decimal (this is hyperbole but only slightly). That they may make up 30 percent of victims is an indication that our collective perception of victimization is incredibly deranged, but when looking at the previous 12 months the rates of rape between men and women approach symmetry, depending on the year of the surveyThe distinction between ""made to penetrate"" and ""rape"" is one that only serves to distort press coverage of the subject. When the NISVS is discussed publicly, the term ""rape"" is mentioned with almost every other breath, whereas ""made to penetrate"" is unlikely to be mentioned at all except in some fringe corners of the discourse that are specifically addressing this inequity. Even the CDC's own perspective seems to be warped, as rape is assigned it's own section in the data table while made to penetrate is put into the sub category of ""other sexual violence"" alongside obviously less severe forms of victimization some of which don't even involve physical contact. The press release by the CDC summarizing their findings, the only part many journalists read and pulled quotes from, mentions rape a total of 7 times and ""made to penetrate"" exactly 0 times. The institution that conducted this very survey apparently could not help but perpetuate the social narrative that sexual violence is an issue almost exclusively affect female victims despite having evidence to the contrary on hand.When researching, it is hard to tell whether some people are including ""made to penetrate"" cases in their discussion of male victims of sexual violence. This obscures a lot of potentially useful insightThe lack of public discussion on this is also one reason why these numbers might actually be underreported: both in personal and second hand experience, I've found that its difficult for people to even recognize their own victimization, and will verbally articulate an experience of having clearly been sexually assaulted while rationalizing the experience as anything other than what it clearly was. To put it hyperbolically, men can be roofied and tied down to a bed but will be unable to categorize their experience as assault until someone points it out to them.It almost goes without saying that this inability to conceive of male victims of female perpetrators is a large part of the reason why so many child rapists go free when their victims happen to be boys. Courts, in places as progressive as California, have apparently lost any perspective that even male children can be genuine victims. In a ruling that held a child liable for child support to his rapist, a California court ruled that ""victims have rights. Here, the victim also has responsibilities‚Äù, a quote so unbelievably toxic that had the victim been a girl we would likely all recognize the quote as a historical stain on our justice system, often repeated in protests as part outcry and part memorial. There are other cases, some worse, where the government has found it in the public interest to turn boys into debt slaves to their own rapists.Even if the existence of male victims is not particularly of interest to some, the knock on effects touch everyone. There is a wealth of data showing that victimization can vastly increase the likelihood of future offending. The boorish and occasionally frightening behavior of some sexually aggressive men might find it's root cause, not in their seeing women as lesser beings, but in their having been conditioned through their own mistreatment to not see anything wrong with their actions. The value of ""do unto others as you would have done unto you"" twists in a horrific way when men are desensitized to even the idea of their own abuse. The idea of respecting other people's boundaries is nigh impossible when you are not taught to have boundaries yourself.If the only thing you are concerned about regarding men is their bad behavior or their mistreatment of women, it is probably in our collective interest not to teach men that violations of boundaries are even situationally acceptable.",6397,1059,-0.9998,0.238,0.701,0.06

3654,VaushV,"I Don't Think all of the AI Art Defenders Here Really Understand Vaush's Criticisms There has been a lot of discourse about AI art as it is now, but Vaush's real concerns seem to stem from how bots will affect society in the future. Sorry for the wall of text, but I have a lot to say.**Instead of thinking about ""Art"" as only referring to images, let's use the other meaning of ""Art"" as a catch-all term for ""creative undertaking.""** Movies, games, novels, music, et cetera are all ""Art"" for the purpose of this conversation.Let's also acknowledge the reality that we live in a Capitalist system where people need money to survive. It's easy to say that creatives will simply follow their passions regardless of whether it makes them money. That may be true sometimes, but no one is born a brilliant artist, writer, or musician. These are skills that must be honed over thousads of hours of practice, and even a master needs time and effort to produce anything of quality. It is not impossible to commit to this time while having a day job, but it's still a hurdle that needs to be cleared. There's also the fact that these humans will soon be competing against AI. This is already happening to digital images, and AI will only get better. It is also only a matter of time before AI becomes a real competitor to other forms of Art. It should not be hard to imagine a scenario where human artists find themselves crowded out of a market saturated with AI productions. This alredy happens with big corporations gatekeeping the spotlight and churning out creatively bankrupt trash. Now imagine those same corporations unleashing the power of AI. AI cannot innovate, and it's dubious whether that's going to change. There is simply too much of a diffrence between how the human brain works and a machine. This is why we suck at math but AI needs help identifying a streetlight. Even if we someday develop a truly sapient AI, it probably wouldn't think or act in a way we think of as human. And while i wound be curious to see the Art a sapient AI might create, that would be more like appreciating the art of a species from another planet than what we currently mean by AI Art.You can argue that humans are not 100% original either, and that is true. However, there is still a fundamental difference between being inspired and simply mashing things together until you get something passable. Tolkien didn't invent elves, but he still added to them in a meaningful way.**Now, imagine a future where nearly every movie, book, game, or song is made by AI.** Any human-made Art is either crowded out to the periphery or instantly assimilated into the hive mind of the algorithm.Imagine living in that world. Imagine a future where all of Art and media is completely devoid of meaning or creative intent. There are no artists or storytellers anymore, at least none that you are likely to find. There's no point asking what an artist is trying to say or why they made a specific creative choice. Art has been completely divorced from human communication.Does anyone really want to live in a world where all you can do is passively enjoy whatever is put in front of you because you know that nothing has any deeper meaning? I don't.That's not even getting into things like chatbots. Do you want to live in a world where the only way to know for sure that you're interacting with another human is to see them face-to-face? I firmly believe that some online interactions can be just as valuable as those occurring in person. However, I'm not sure that will stay true if you can never be sure whether you're talking to a real human or jsut a facsimile.**This is the future that Vaush is worried about**, and I agree with him. You might say this is just apocalyptic doomsaying, and I'm not convinced it's the inevitable outcome. I can even see how AI art can help some people realize their creative vision. However, I do believe the above scenario is what could happen if AI Art proliferates unchecked. I've yet to see any compelling arguments for why this isn't a valid concern.",4065,721,0.9961,0.069,0.785,0.146

3680,VaushV,"My problem with both sides of the AI art discourse lately Listening to the back and forth has been kinda frustrating, so I just wanted to give some perspective I think might be getting missed on both sides.In arguing against Vaush's take, people seem to be focussing exclusively on justifying the non-communicative view of art, rather than identifying where communication comes from.and why it is not, categorically, restricted to humans. You're just digging yourself deeper, here.On Vaush's end, for all his anti-theism, he seems to have a strange attachment to the metaphysical nature of human consciousness, as opposed to it being an emergent property of a physical system.My problem isn't that he doesn't consider current AI to be communicative consciousnesses, or that it won't be for a while. But what irks me is his fetishization of ""thought"" as a concept that AI is categorically not capable of. Just taking a step back, what is consciousness? What is the root of this ""communicative intent"" he so values? Well, as he even stated himself in today's stream, it is the emergent property of the physical body. Fundamentally, we have inputs (senses), storage and processing of said input (memory, thought), and output (action). The ""thought"" here is simply the crunching of data that your senses have brought in; the creation of art, then, is the action that comes from the processing of various experiences. AI also has input, storage, and processing. However the difference between the art output by an AI, and that output by a human is that the human has various life experience outside of looking at and processing other art, whereas the AI doesn't have any of the rest (i.e. eating, sleeping, playing with friends, going to school, work, experiencing joy, hurt, loss, etc.). In my opinion, this is what makes human art more ""valuable"" than AI art. Whether or not the output is identical, the system creating the art has all of this peripheral experience that adds immense context and texture to the experience of engaging in communication with them (whether artistic or otherwise). I would go so far as to say that this extra-artistic context is what makes the result valuable as an artistic expression at all.Now, to be charitable, I do believe Vaush's contention is very similar; he's just not recognizing that this doesn't mean the AI isn't ""thinking"". He's, justifiably, caught up in pushing against the anti-humanist cohort, that he's reflexively formed an attachment to this nebulous concept of ""consciousness"", and has failed to realize that it isn't this magic threshold, but a hodgepodge of various input, processing, and output systems.Now to address the anti-humanist, anti-comminicative faction in the discourse. Y'all are annoying as hell, and only make it worse for everyone. If you truly believe experiencial value is the only value, I don't care for your opinion on any art, AI or human. Vaush is 99% right about AI art, and 110% right about you guys. Whether or not AI art is created with intent or not, the lack of the broad breadth of human experience is a huge factor that matters. In trying to advocate for a physicalist ontology of consciousness, you fail to recognize the importance of human lived experience to communicative value and intent. If you can't understand this, I guess the rock is all that's left.Sorry for the venty tone, I just think Vaush is 99% on it, but because of the anti-humanist types, has been reflexively pushed into a strange place on the metaphysical nature of consciousness.",3534,587,0.9384,0.08,0.817,0.104

As it stands, the data the corporations who are training and selling these models use can be aquired without license or consent. What this in practice means is that the labor value of that data, created by human beings who spent decades to perfect their craft, is extracted by the corporations who are in control of these AIs. The data produced by the people now fuels the imagination of the machines. The creativity of mankind is the oil, taken from them for free under the guise of the democratization of art. Stability AI, lead by former hedgefund manager Mohammad Emad Mostaque, has managed to spread this narrative very effectively. He conveniently omits that his company is now valued at 1 billion $. His so called open source project has extracted the value of thousands of artists, nullifying the worth of their labour while concentrating all that value at a handful of corporations.Stability AI, or any similar corporation, will likely grow to become worth trillions eventually. Meanwhile, it will be argued that training AI is no different from humans learning from each other. That indeed, everyone is free to use data and learn from it however way they please. And of course, this applies to the machines and more importantly those who sit behind them. Yet, never before in the history of mankind was a singular individual capable of extracting the value of millions of artists, if not all artists, and concentrating all that wealth and creative power at one point. But of course, we are supposed to believe this is just the same. They say all art is derivative, after all.They will argue this is for the good of creativity. That this will give more humans access to self-expression. Now, I will not go into the details of why the commodification of art leads to the destruction of the very purpose of art, and why allowing the machines to replace our imagination is a terrible idea. Instead, I want to demonstrate that none of this will actually lead to the democratization of art. That instead, all we are doing is preparing a future in which the powerful will be in control of all creative output.At first glance it seems very appealing, does it not? Giving everyone infinite freedom to create anything they please. Sure, jobs will be replaced, but artists will adapt with the times and use the machines as tools, will they not?Short contemplation reveals that this only works as long as everyone is given access to the AIs. Today, you can run these MLA's on your own computer, if you have a graphics card that has enough compute power. However, it's only a matter of time before these AIs will grow more sophisticated. What we are observing today is child's play, we are barely learning how to crawl. At some point they will be so complex and compute intensive that only those with enough ressources will be able to run them. They will become so valuable that giving away access to them will be irrational. Why do we assume the future mega-corporations would care about human artists, if they can just generate all the creations themselves?Do you believe you, as a human, can predict the taste of the masses the way these corporations can? Social media companies are already capable of manipulating an entire generation of humans to sit infront of a screen and waste their entire lives away with meaningless drivel. What will they be capable of once they employ Machine Learning to learn from our consumptive choices about what kind of AI-generated content we will most prefer?You as a flimsy human will not compete in that environment. The machines will not be a tool. You'll be a dimwitted ape in a world of Mega-AIs capable of sifting through the mega-feed of data that it produced, and using an evolutionary process to establish how to shape and satisfy it's consumers to the fullest degree possible. Even if the corporations give you the mercy of using their AIs, everything you do with those machines will be just another datapoint, used to train the next generation of machines.How much huberis and arrogance do you have to presume that these AIs will not eventually have extracted all possible value you could provide? What if, despite your self-absorbed view of human superiority, it turns out that you are nothing more than an animal?It will no longer be creativity for the people, by the people. In essence, it will be art for the machines, by the machines. All you will be is a conduit that serves to generate maximum profit, to oil the machines, until even that will be rendered obsolete.And this is only art. All of what I described will eventually apply to all human capacities. Science, journalism, medicine, philosophy. But of course, as fate has ordained, it all starts with the arts. Remove our humanity from the process in the pursuit of endless stimulation. More, faster. Who cares if it took a human to make it, as long as it's better? Who cares if their love was an integral part of the process, if the only goal is maximum pleasure?Disconnect us from each other, from ourselves, then the rest will be a walk in the park. Those in power will not even require to enslave us with their machines. They will lull us into a deep slumber of endless stimulation so that we will willingly give over our humanity, embracing our fate instead of resisting it.In this world, the machines and the data fed to train them will be the only thing of value. The artists are just one step along the way, to be trampled and discarded, while pretending that now, all are given the capacity to create. In reality, mankind is selling it's soul to the machines, and by extention, those who control them.It really should have been obvious, should it not? First machine artists, then machine journalists. Then machine scientists, machine teachers, machine programmers, machine police-officers. Machine soldiers.And then, there is no going back. Sitting at the switch will be the those who will determine the fate of this world, a world in which humans have been rendered useless and incapable.",6495,1119,0.9978,0.051,0.822,0.126
3683,VaushV,"How do you guys cope with being a part of the finance/tech industry? Hey fellow peeps, ever since I graduate uni and started working I feel like my life is slowly growing more meaningless the more I put time into my career.I work in the tech field adjacent to the finance industry, helping to maintain HPC environments. You can see me as one big nerd consultant for grid computing or just a big bitch for the financial overlords to bark at. The job is interesting, I deal with a lot of unique issue and they pay is great.  My main problem is I feel like my contribution to society is a net negative. All I do is ensure that these financial companies can maintain their daily operation of stock sims, risk analysis and whatever bullshit that allows them to infinitely grow their money. I understand that my part is insignificant in the grand scheme of things; however, I still feel as if I'm a proponent to the status quo.I honestly may bail on the tech field in general.

3684,VaushV,"Vaush claims that AI art and human made art isn't the same, even if the products were identical, because one is communication from a real person and the other isn't. He is right, but so what? As a consumer of computer games, music, paintings, photographs, etc, it is almost ALWAYS that it's the end product that I love.           Art can make me feel things. It can make me cry with happiness and sadness, or laugh when it's funny. But in almost all cases I have no knowledge of how the art was made. Unless there are youtube videos of a someone creating their digital art I can't truly know that they made it themselves or that an AI didn't make it. And going forward it will be the case more and more often that there might be AI involved in the art we consume, either completely, or partially. The whole debate around whether AI is stealing art or not isn't what I'm talking about. The rammification for artists can perhaps be felt as AI get better. But what I'm talking about is what the art means to me, as a comsumer. And if I can't tell what's AI and what's not, then there's nothing that really changes in my personal experience, right? What most people who are interested in art understand sooner or later is that art is in the eye of the beholder. Many artists are unwilling to elaborate on the meaning of their art as well, saying that the meaning is up to us. And it is. We have different life experiences, and will interpret things in life differently from each other. And this will be the same with AI art. We will interpret that in our own ways as well.",1568,293,0.9542,0.058,0.833,0.109

3700,VaushV,"I feel like Vaush is off-base with his hate of AI art. So let me preface this by saying that I don't disagree with Vaush's general view of art.  I don't think AI art is the same as regular art.  I think that art is more of an experience that humans share in both the creation and viewing of art.  So I do not think an AI algorithm is capable of ""art"" in that sense.And I think it's also true that one image generated by an AI isn't really impressive.  I also don't think that one planet generated by No Man's Sky's procedural algorithm is impressive.But I don't think this is any reason to hate AI image generation or denigrate it as some kind of abomination.  The reality is that AI image generation will give human artists the ability to create more complex forms of art (like video games, movies, composite digital art, etc.) in much shorter time frames. Because let's face it, there's a lot of labor in creative endeavors that is just kind of drudgery.  Like doing the same poses for 50 different sprites.  Or doing things like terrain textures.  I don't think that this stuff would generally be considered the height of artistic expression.  But the video game or animation that all of this work is ultimately put in to, might be something really artistic.The point is that AI art has the capability to make larger artistic endeavors like animations or video games much more widely accessible to the masses.  You wouldn't need to practice visual art for years to make a pixel art game that looked great and unique.  And you could even maybe make a 3d game with completely original textures in whatever style you want by utilizing AI as a tool in the future.Ultimately, I think AI art will just be another step forward in technology and automation.  It will of course eliminate some jobs as automation always does, and this is unfortunate.  But ultimately, I think it will make the world better for everyone.",1912,341,0.9594,0.035,0.862,0.103

Automation in general is an amazing concept, and opens up the doors for humanity to create even more because of freed up time.The real problem with AI Art is not really a problem with AI art at all, it's an issue with Intellectual Property as a concept. The fact that we've allowed people to claim ideas and prevent other people from using those ideas in various contexts is wrong and backwards.Because of the way IP Law works, the only way for an artists to reasonably make money today is for them to reserve the rights to created works and hope they make a profit from their creations. Once we can automate creation of the style of the works someone creates, they lose their marketability and can no longer use their IP as leverage to make profit. We went through something similar in the Open Source world a while ago with GitHub's Copilot. Microsoft made a service that can help in the coding process, but it was trained on Open Source project's code without attribution. I think a solution to this problem would be that we have something like Copyleft for automated derivative works, or that we have attribution and artists can gain royalties (or something) off of art that is trained on their own art.AI art is real art, I don't think it's any less valid than traditional art. Art for me is in the eye of the beholder, it doesn't necessarily matter if there was human intent behind what has been created. If I feel emotion when I look at a picture that is clearly being presented as ""art"", then it's art.Are Christians who see art in nature wrong because god doesn't exist? Is abstract art not valid because it doesn't have traditional meaning? What about an album like Pulse Demon by Merzbow? Would you seriously be able to tell me that that album shows artistic ""human intent""?With all that being said, I personally will support traditional artists because I don't like the idea of paying for something that is generated from someone else's work at the expense of the original artist.",2129,381,0.9855,0.055,0.8,0.145

This camp was really just summer school. One of my students was from a group home, and he was as street as you can get. Little eighth grader with a few shitty tattoos, a bad attitude, brought weed pens to camp, and just did and say what ever the fuck he wanted. Cool kid honestly. But he had a pretty shitty life. Group home life fucks these kids up. This kid had stories you'd hear prison inmates tell.One day, him and another camp councilor, who was his teacher at his middle school, both told me he got a job at auto zone. So sometimes he wont show up for school. I asked ""Well how the fuck does that work? Dudes like 13/14???""He gets paid under the table, 8 bucks a day.""I asked the kid if that was true. He said yeah, and he loved it. He finally has money to pay for new things. He told me so far he's got a new shirt, and he was getting himself his first phone charger.

He was saying that his friend should man up, and not be a p\*\*\*y or something like that. However, he added that if it was a hot woman in that situation, he'd totally give her cpr and help her. When saying those things, he looked very serious with his image of tough guy which I found made it even more hilarious. I thought the guy was a comedian. Like no way anyone would have that opinion. I never watch any of his other content, but I saw images of him with his image of tough guy and I thought it was hilarious considering how ridiculous his character is. Fast forward, I saw people on social media saying that Andrew has terrible opinions. I first thought people were talking about the character and laughing about it.

I do want to state, I am not counting our chickens, simply looking to analyze what this means for the political landscape and future of democracy. ‚ÄúKavanaugh‚Äôs and Barrett‚Äôs questions to Thompson were less revealing than those from Roberts. But Kavanaugh seemingly suggested that the version of the independent state legislature theory advanced by the North Carolina lawmakers was going too far. He noted that North Carolina was trying to go further than then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist‚Äôs concurrence in the 2000 case Bush v. Gore, which is the origin of the theory that state courts have overstepped their role and that they could be hemmed in in some way.Kavanaugh also raised a brief from the Conference of Chief Justices, a collection of chief jurists from the states, asking how to square their writing about the history of state courts applying state constitutions to federal elections, with the independent state legislature theory. Barrett, meanwhile, also seemed skeptical at times of the argument that Thompson was advancing, noting that state constitutions could be amended.‚ÄùJust curious to hear peoples thoughts on the future of democracy if this is rejected. Also does this make you feel optimistic in any sense? Would like Vaush to address these development (forgive me if he has and politely point me in the right direction to see that) considering this has been a critical point of his content lately.",1597,260,0.3506,0.056,0.876,0.068

3852,VaushV,"ACAB is a horrendously bad slogan with no other use than making enemies. It should be abandoned in favor of NOAL or FKC (No Officers Above the Law, or Fire/F\*ck Killer Cops)ACAB has zero positive utility. Denoting politically vague hatred of anyone that opts into or is coerced into a specific profession directly hurts the Left and helps the Right paint us as unreasonable hateful wannabe criminals. Saying ACAB doesn't denote any measure of the nuance and pragmatism that the Left is so allergic to. We're so addicted to ""fightin' the man"" and being the uncompromising underdog freedom fighter that we make enemies where we don't have to, alienate a LOT of potential allies, play to the Right's interests, and block ourselves from infiltrating and gaining resources from existing power structures. Every seat we fill is one not occupied by a fascist and cops don't hire for quantity. Down the line, it could even **heavily** benefit our chances at dual power or surviving the next fascist uprising. (Need I remind us it was cops blocking the way on Jan 6th...) (Also free training, gear, experience, community exposure, etc)Seriously, this purity-testing bullsh\*t based on a profession that (let's face it) would be a lot better without the ineptitude and bigotry **we're helping worsen** is ridiculous. If we're going to apply hateful and meaningless language to every person participating directly in a system we don't like, then we're all just as much of bastards as the cops we rightfully and wrongfully shit on. Not to mention ACAB's redundancy next to Black lives matter. Cops not being workers is also bullsh\*t. Police unions are corrupt. FKCU has potential. But everyone who works is a worker.I would go as far as to say that it's fundamentally immoral to not take the most pragmatic approach. The world is counting on us to do so. No more of this virtue-signalling, anti-utilitarian, larpy, no-benefit crap. If there's anything we should be starting discourse over, it's getting every prominent left-leaning to start using more effective messaging. We need it now more than ever. We need guns more than ever. We need power, security, and tactics more than ever. What we don't need is ACAB.",2203,366,-0.9256,0.136,0.763,0.101

But in my experience the vast majority of it is ridiculously easy to refute and so obviously biased that it's not even funny. It also tends to not be very creative and really rather cookie-cutter. As in, if you've read one or two articles on a topic by a right-winger, you've basically read them all. Which is not at all true for left-wing stuff, in my experience (though certain themes do of course repeat for left-wingers too).Idk, the lack of sophistication really bothers me more than anything. If society is going to be screwed over by people buying into ridiculous right-wing propaganda, I'd at least like to think the propagandists have to put some effort into it.

Specifically, I'd like to defend the steps we've taken to collectivize agriculture and industrialize the country.Karl Marx: Ah, yes. I've heard a lot about those efforts. It's certainly true that industrialization and collectivization are necessary for the development of a socialist society. But I have some concerns about the way they've been implemented in the Soviet Union.Joseph Stalin: Such as?Karl Marx: Well, for one thing, the forced collectivization of agriculture has led to widespread famine and suffering among the peasantry. This is not the type of progress that I had in mind when I wrote about the need for a socialist society.Joseph Stalin: I understand your concerns, Karl. But let's not forget that we are building a new society from the ground up. This is a difficult and complicated process, and there are always going to be challenges and setbacks along the way.Karl Marx: I agree that building a new society is difficult, but I also believe that it is important to minimize suffering and ensure that the needs of the people are met. The forced collectivization of agriculture has not done this.Joseph Stalin: I think you're underestimating the progress we've made. The Soviet Union is now a major industrial power, and our economy is growing at a rapid pace. This would not have been possible without collectivization and industrialization.Karl Marx: I don't deny that there have been some successes, but at what cost? The forced relocation of entire villages, the widespread famine, and the repression of dissent are not acceptable means to an end.Joseph Stalin: I understand your concerns, Karl. But we must also consider the bigger picture. The Soviet Union is at a critical juncture in its history. We are surrounded by capitalist powers that are hostile to our cause. We must do whatever it takes to ensure the survival and success of our socialist experiment.Karl Marx: I understand your point, Joseph. But I believe that the survival and success of socialism depends on the well-being and support of the people. If the socialist experiment is built on suffering and repression, it will not be sustainable in the long run.Joseph Stalin: I respect your opinion, Karl. But I believe that we are on the right track.

3886,VaushV,"""May The Force be...Neoliberalism"" After watching Andor (A Star Wars Story) it makes it very clear, to me.  That The Force is essentially Geroge Lucas not being able to square the real solution for the world he built.  It is not the system itself, it's who is in charge of it.  That's all George Lucas could ever bring himself to solve the problem in his universe.  A combination of Great Man Theory. The Force it can be good or bad, it's a matter of if said Great Man is controlling it.    Also I don't know what ""Bringing balance the The Force"" is supposed to fucking mean?  Like does it have to be half awful somewhere for it to be good somewhere else?  That would definitely be on theme for the stories we have been told. Seems the message is The Force is a system we have to live with, who is in control of it is all you can change.  Also all the systemic problems in the galaxy can be linked back to who is in charge and their ""Force D character alignment"".  This is why I think Star Wars always, to some degree, fell flat (even the OG films).  Andor shows that The Republic was not so much better than The Empire.  The Force is irrelevant, and collective action is the only way to fight oppression.  I want more leftists to watch it because there is so much more to discuss and I could keep this thread alive for days with any of yall who saw it ü•∞.

3887,VaushV,"Effortpost about Adam Something using Masterworks as a sponsor I started writing this when his latest video only had about 400 comments but tweaked it for so long that with I posted there were over 4.3k comments. Adam will never see it but I wondered what people here thought of my arguments?---Hey Adam, I'm honestly pretty disappointed in your selection of Masterworks as a sponsor. As a leftist and a humanist you are well aware that the commodity form is exploitative and alienating. Art does have intrinsic value but it is not economic; it's cultural. Communal. The value of art is in it being shared and experienced by as many people as possible so we can all see how similar and wonderful and unique the world is. The value of art is in what it allows us to feel and share in other's feelings across time and cultures and languages.Did you know that one of the largest (if not the largest) collections of fine art in the world is owned by JP Morgan Chase? And do you know what they do with literally hundreds of millions worth of art? They use it to decorate corporate office buildings and in fancy meeting rooms where they woo high-value clients. None of these artworks are viewable by the vast majority of society. Private art ownership on this scale amounts to a theft of commons. Group ownership of art that is then sold for a profit is only reducing the amount of people who can ever interact with the art. You want to pay to preserve and maintain art? Support your local art museum. Every country and every major city on earth has art museums that are free or very low-cost where you can see artists from every time in history and from every genre. Treating art as a commodity trade item literally destroys its artistic value as that value is only realized when the art is appreciated by humans. If you want art for yourself, buy a nice giclee reproduction. They are very affordable and extremely high quality now. You can buy them from museums that curate the originals and contribute to the arts' protection for society. if you want to invest in art, donate to art museums or conservatories that collect, protect, and loan originals for viewing at museums.Don't take art from others by treating it as a commodity for the benefit of capital.",2255,402,0.9969,0.023,0.796,0.181

3924,VaushV,"Fellow Southern Conservatives, it is time to stop acting like football isn't bad optically. Hear me out (of course you will, because if you don't you are a sus degenerate tee hee), it's time you admit that not admitting football is sus is killing us optically and will lead to the whole population wanting to genocide us if it continues. I will present my case by making UNDENIABLE, FACTUAL STATEMENTS about football that are not at all framed through my ideology.    There is a ton of grooming that goes on at football stadiums, and people bring their children to NFL games all the time. This is fucking weird as we can see through every aspect of the process.        GOING TO THE GAME: Kids are groomed to adopt the cult ritual of wearing a specific garb that identifies them to other members of the group, instilling a false sense of trust in each other. This makes it easier for pedophiles to get access to your children, and will put them at risk of indoctrination in the future. It also encourages them to risk their life travelling by vehicle to arrive to a stadium full of tens of thousands of strangers, at least one of which is a pedophile.           IN THE STADIUM: Your child is subjected to the drug abuse, violence, and foul language of the unvetted strangers around you. If you attend a game with a school band present, your children are at risk of listening to songs that simulate sex such as ""Get Lucky"" by Daft Punk, and promote unhealthy relationships and swearing such as ""Fuck You"" By CeeLo Green. The strangers around your children may sing along or groove to these songs, which is extremely sus and makes them seem like pedophiles.    THE CHEERLEADERS: This is obviously a pedophilic grooming habit. If it wasn't, the cheerleaders would have the sense to stop immediately when they see a child in the audience. They do dances that simulate sex by bending over, gyrating their bodies, and have men lift them up and expose their panties. All of them are in heavy makeup and costume. This grooms young girls to become cheerleaders in high school, where they do sex dances and twerking in front of audiences full of pedophiles.    THE PLAYERS: These men run at each other full speed, ramming their bodies into one another. Head trauma is incredibly common, and players are taken off on stretchers regularly. This exposes and grooms children to the perversions of those who see violence as fun. Players and coaches also slap each other's butts on the field, which is a sex act that the child witnesses and internalizes as okay. The end effect of this is glorifying and grooming children to damage their brains, have their butts slapped by potential pedophiles, and be exposed to a possible pedophile while in the locker room during matches.         As we can see by my arguments, if you don't agree with me you are kinda cringe and kinda sus, and the public will want you harmed and killed. If you defend this shit you are a part of the problem of the football groomer panic, and need to stop. You must take me seriously, please stop calling me a suspiciously concerned nerd and sound the alarm bells to everyone about this danger to our conservative movement.

3932,VaushV,"I don't think racism or racial conflict can ever be overcome, based on my own experiences as a black American I truly don't think racism can be overcome, ever. I don't think race relations are better now than they were in the 80s, or the 60s, or even the 30s.I believe that white and black Americans have what I'd call a blood feud, an infernal bond. The bond that ties us together isn't ""being American"" and it sure as shit isn't ""harmony"", it's a bond of hatred, sealed in blood by the history of slavery and apartheid. I do not believe reconciliation is possible, African-Americans hate European-Americans for trying to steal our humanity and then enslaving us with racial apartheid and neoliberal capitalism after the first bloody affair had ended.My experiences having white friends, white acquaintances, white teachers, white lovers, as well as extensively browsing 4chan has taught me that the bond of hatred can absolutely¬†never¬†be overcome. Hatred, ignorance, and fear are the most powerful things in existence, they are far stronger than love and understanding. Hatred and ignorance allow humans to embrace what exists at their rotten core, pure evil, which lies in the pit of everyone's heart.Basically to overcome racism you would need to overcome **hatred**, but nothing is more powerful than hatred, the real world isn't like Naruto. Sometimes hatred is just passed on from father to son, forever. Like look at the Yugoslavs, they were forced, by the socialist government, to try overcoming racism for literal decades. As soon as Tito died the Serbians, Kosovons, Bosnians, Croats, and everyone else started to *massacre* each other. Anyone that thinks hatred can ever be overcome should just look at Yugoslavia, it's impossible, there is no middle ground between blacks wanting freedom and white people wanting them dead. After walking around this country and seeing that hatred never ends, how can I think it can get better?",1940,320,-0.9815,0.192,0.674,0.134

3934,VaushV,"Why I don't think what happened what happened to the main accuser of Callahan was ""coercion"". If you disagree, help me understand it. Thx. First things first: H3h3 said that Andrew basically admitted he did it. So that makes Andrew a creep and he needs to apologize to the victims publicly and seek help to address the seemingly massive problem he has with how he approaches sex. I don't defend what he seems to have done.That said, I do want to point out an issue that many on the left seem to have and which makes it easy for right wingers to dismiss feminism as ""having gone too far"". I want the left to be strong and for that it needs to be correct, which is why I make the following criticism:What happened to Cornbreadasserole (the person who came out with everything) was not rape. It also wasn't sexual assault (not talking about the other cases, but only about this specific one). What it was is sexual harassmant. No more, no less. It's regretable that she eventually gave consent, when she didn't really want to. I don't know what they did - she says that no penetrative sex happened - but whatever they did was too much for her. So, I cannot understand why she would *ever* agree to doing *anything.* Unless there is a *threat* of violence or other nature, you should never say *""ok, lets have sex"",* if you don't want to have sex. No matter what. Even if he asks 100 times. Just say no 100 times. That's what I would do - and the women I talked with about this agree (my partner and friends - all leftists).Is Andrew a sexual harasser for asking 100 times? Yes. Is it extremely tedious to keep rejecting him and something she shouldn't have to do? Also yes. Is it still better than having sex with someone you don't want to have sex with? Super-yes! If the other woman, who used to date Callahan, was able to tell him to leave while he was already groping her - which is a significantly more scary situation - then so could she.What happened to Cornbreadasserole is awful. But it was not rape. Because it was not coercion. It was pestering - which is harassment. She could've just kept saying no - or better yet don't even lead him to your place, if he's already being such a creep. Cornbreadasserole said that she for a long time thought it was her fault and sadly I have to say: Yeah it kinda is. Not in the sense that she invited this problem in any way - she shouldn't have had to deal with this behaviour in the first place! But that they eventually did end up having sex is on her.To call this scenario coercion is to claim that women don't have agency. If you disagree with this, don't get mad and explain your reasoning. If I'm wrong, I want to know why. Thx.",2680,500,-0.9466,0.128,0.752,0.12

4000,VaushV,"Masculinity  Strength I legitimately don't know if this will be an unpopular opinion or a popular one on here, but here I go.Right-wingers often love to pose with guns, and emphasize how ""masculine"" they are in various ways. Just now some Republican randomly tweeted ""I need a spa day followed by a mani pedi, said me never."" And it just made me think of something.Now, I don't really care much about ""masculinity"" as a concept anyway. But generally strength is considered a core part of traditional masculinity, no?Well, I'd ask the following question, what takes more strength: To be an open trans man in a highly conservative state or to talk about how you love football, lift weights, have guns and don't need mani pedis all the time?Because in my opinion it's obvious.A guy who talks about ""Oh, I'm so masculine"" all the time is doing nothing more than cowering like a little boy. Begging the people around them to please, please value them. Please don't think I'm a girly girl, please, please, please confirm my gender identity. And they're just ""fitting in."" I think that takes no strength at all. And, in fact, when it goes against who you really are, I think it betrays a real fear and cowardice. A fear of standing up to others.On the other hand, an open trans man living in a highly conservative state... that person is going to get a lot of pushback. Is going to get looks. Is going to be judged all the time by the people around them. That's not even mentioning the possibility of physical attack. To still say ""I'm going to be who I want to be and live my happiest life."" I think that takes a great deal of strength.I'd say that trans man embodies the ideal of masculine ""strength"" far more than those clearly insecure conservatives who just behave as what's expected of them.*Btw, just to be clear, my take: Masculinity as a normative concept doesn't matter. People should live the lives that make them happiest. Beyond that it doesn't matter. Nobody should force themselves to be unhappy just to live up to some idea of what others think someone of a certain sex should be like.*",2095,372,0.996,0.076,0.717,0.206

He has been open about be molested as a child, addiction, previous open relationships, relapse, many aspects of himself and his relationships. He also has an empathetic mind for considering/presenting other perspectives. All while also being someone I think many would consider masculine.The convo is roughly the first 1.5 hrs of the episode.

The 40 hour work week and all the other protections only exist because the unions fought for them and the state did everything they could to stop them including literal massacres. Only after the establishment had no other choice, they conceded and legislated rights. Can we really call this democracy if the only way to get rights that everyone benefits from is through violent illegal action? If it was a real democracy then all of this should have happened through political discourse. Maybe the act of passing such laws that benefit the people could be called democratic, but the state itself is anything but that, it‚Äôs actually a plutocracy.Ofc the ruling class makes propaganda to whitewash all of this but we should not fall for it. They downplay or entirely ignore how protests and strikes were violently suppressed and the role of radical organizations and just give credits to the moderates(or people who they whitewash into being moderates such as MLK) and the political establishment for passing the laws.

4024,VaushV,"Can Vaush comment on the OGL D debacle? I know that there are bigger problems in the world but hear me out...The old OGL (open gaming license) allowed independent creators to create and monetize their own D related content, including custom campaigns, settings etc.Now any DM who's played the game for more than a couple of years will tell you that the vibrant community that that single document created is what has made the game worth playing for so long.And not just that, small companies, including Paizo, one of D main competitors, depend on the open gaming license in order to avoid litigation from the company behind D Wizards of the Coast, which is owned by Hasbro.Paizo is a great company, they're one of the first roleplaying game companies to allow their workers to unionize, and they believe in open gaming so much that they publish many of their rules for free. But they could lose all that once the old OGL dies and Hasbro decides to flex their litigation muscles.Which brings to the death of the old OGL. There was been a leak of a new OGL (OGL 1.1) which cancels the old one and replaces it with a startling legal document that takes away many of the rights of the people who sign it. It demands 25% of their revenue above 750k and lays claim to their intellectual property. It also states that Wizards can change the document at their whim, provided they give 30 days notice. Noone knows if any of this will hold up in court, but it's enough for Wizards to SLAPP their competitors out of existence.Now, Wizards has not commented on anything yet (there's been nothing but radio silence the last few days), and it IS a leak, but part of it was corroborated by one of the people at kickstarter, and it has already created so much uncertainty that many big third party creators have come out with plans to migrate.D may be just a game, but to some third party creators who managed to turn it into a source of revenue, it is their dream as well as their livelihood. I'd also like to say that culture is really important. The old OGL was a good way to create culture, it created a vibrant community. The new one will destroy it, and the damage may have already been done.I've heard Vaush mention D in one of his streams, so It would be really cool if he did a segment on this, just to get the word out.",2313,425,0.9885,0.08,0.761,0.159

This is a decent shared hobby to bond over. I am a stoner and a pretty socialable person, and Ive found in m experience working kitchens smoking with coworkers is a good way to get to know people. If you work a shit job(resturants, retail, warehousing etc) everybody smokes weed. If you think someone you work with is cool and a want to get to know them invite them to smoke weed after. Generally the parking lot or a bar resturant are good venues. your apartment is an ok spot if your comfortable, but be careful until you build a rapport because they might get the wrong idea. If your in a city, especially a legal one go to a bodega grab some food(kettle chips are the best imo). Talk shit about movies, put them on to music if you have similar taste, food convos are awesome, and something emotional might come up too but i wouldnt initate until you know them a bit better. Its a good way to get to know people and being stoned can take the pressure off and make it easier to talk.  This also works in social spaces with alot of stoners but if you need this advice i assume you dont frequent them.2nd DISCLAIMER: If youve never smoked weed before and want to take this advice (DONT DO IT JUST TO MAKE FRIENDS NOT HEALTHY) be careful, it can cause anxiety if you smoke too much or impair movement and cognitive function. figure out what your limit is before trying this with another person it can be super embarssing.3rd disclaimer: if you end up getting to know someone this way and they never bring the weed they might be an asshole or broke(use discresion)",1888,349,0.99,0.042,0.799,0.158

Since being a tate fan can be expensive. And while you still should reach out...they come in knowing the deal a bit more. And people who clearly made a decesion.

4070,VaushV,"The prosecutors of Andrew Tate leaked to the Romanian press a number of transcripts of wiretapped conversations held among the victims, the Tates and the 2 women arrested. The transcripts contain admissions of criminality, manipulation, violent threats and more corroborating victim testimony It has become the most common talking point among Tate's supporters, and even his own lawyer, to say that there is actually zero proof of any of the allegations made against the Tates. It has been widely known in Romania for a week now that this is simply not the case, since the prosecution has leaked a number of snippets from wiretapped transcripts they obtained during their investigation.These transcripts were used, along with the victim statements, expert psychological reports of the victims and Andrew Tate's own words published to social media in public videos to convince the Judge that there is at least a reasonable suspicion that the defendants committed the crimes of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group, while the judge asked for more evidence of the rape accusation (it is notoriously difficult to prove rape, especially if said rape happened a long time ago).One of the defence strategies Tate's lawyer used was to say that Tate was simply playing a character, or persona, in his videos so the videos shouldn't be used as evidence. However, the judge disagreed with this defence as the wiretapped transcripts obtained by prosecutors showed Tate with the same attitude and personality in private messages between himself and the victims and others.I will layout all of the transcripts that have been leaked so far along with the sources for each transcript, they have been translated from Romanian using Google translate.TRANSCRIPT 1: Andrew Tate manipulates one of the victims into flying to Romania by promising marriage, then discusses said victim as a commodity to be used for making money.Source: Conversation 1 (promise of marriage):Emory (Andrew Tate): You have to understand that once you're mine, you'll be mine forever. A woman never leaves her man. I will be the last man in your life.Emory: what do we do if we fall in love and I kidnap you to bring you to Bucharest?  Girl: I don't think it's kidnapping, if I want to come.Emory: first I have to see in your eyes that you will never be able to live without me. And then I can trust you to show you everything  Girl: Bring a ring with you when you come üòäEmory: Can you be loving enough to be a wife? To always be by my side, wherever I go? Talk to 0 men besides me? Ride or die? üòäEmory: you have to move to Romania with me, to keep an eye on you.  Emory: You're mine. Do not forget that. And act like it. We will be together soon.  Girl: but can I trust you?  Emory: Yes. You can.  Emory: You will move to Romania with me. I plan when I get there. First, I might have to go to Prague for a few days.  Emory: and we meet in Romania.Emory: and I want to know that you are committed  Emory: Serious about marriage.  Girl: Yes. I am serious.Conversation 2 (discussion of victim as a commodity, PI in this context is one of the women who was arrested along with Tate):ANDREW TATE: Did you tell the new one that you make a lot of money?  ANDREW TATE: ask her to take pictures of you  PI: yes.  PI: you mean me and her in the pictures?  ANDREW TATE: yes  PI: what kind of pictures?  ANDREW TATE: anything for onlyfans  PI: in underwear? She won't  ANDREW TATE: seePI: G talked to her today and will go live with B tonight to tryANDREW TATE: And with Tristan's new girl you're doing a really good job  ANDREW TATE: Tristan wants you to bring her back and stay there  ANDREW TATE: I'm taking care of B and U tomorrow, we have to be alone and find a solution to to stay"".  PI:. does she know about onlyfans?TRISTAN TATE: no  TRISTAN TATE: and she's studying to be a lawyer, she doesn't care  TRISTAN TATE: and she never would  PI:. know. She asked me to show her my TikTok and I wasn't sure.TRANSCRIPT 2: Supports the prosecutions case that Andrew Tate is the leader of the organised criminal group and there is a hierarchy with Andrew Tate at the topSource: Conversation 1:Girl: I heard you're the one running the OnlyFans and TikTok girls business.  Andrew Tate: Tristan and Georgiana are there, but I lead themConversation 2 (Radu Luana to one of the victims demanding money and saying that the victim is accountable to her, she is accountable to Tristan and Tristan is accountable to Andrew, the hierarchy of the criminal group is demonstrated):Radu Luana: The money from yesterday, 3 dollars  Radu Luana: Give me something, I'm foaming at the mouth  Radu Luana: That at the end of the month Andrew will argue with Tristan Tate, Tristan Tate with me and I with youConversation 3 (Andrew tells the victim not to leave the house without one of the 3 trusted employees (Tristan, and the 2 ""angels"" arrested) following and watching her, making a clear threat despite the victim pleading that she wants to leave the house alone:Andrew Tate: You don't go anywhere without one of the three (trusted employee nos).Young woman: Why are you so cold to me?Andrew Tate: Don't go out alone without telling me.Andrew Tate: Mall, supermarket, nowhere from now on.Young woman: I told you I wanted to go aloneAndrew Tate: It's the last warning!TRANSCRIPT 3: Andrew Tate admits to victim that he ""has to hide"" what he is really doing and that he does money laundering, exploiting women by using them to do illegal activities for him such as moving money and illegal items/documents, he also claims ""he would never do that"" to the victim, presumably another form of manipulation to make the victim feel ""special"" and that he ""cares"" about her:Source: Andrew Tate : You're not stupid and you can probably guess how I make so much money. I have to hide what I'm really doing.Victim : Web cam?Andrew Tate : I've been doing this for a long time with a team of girls working on video chat. The company was fake, but this is how I laundered my dirty money. Some of the girls who worked for me (...) I used them to do other things.

I tough he offer good insight in regard of the concept of consent. But I have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that some people would legitimately not see the difference between a hard no and playful foreplay. To give you some context, I am a dude and I have being married for a really long time. Smartphone did not exist when I started dating my wife, so not only do I not know anything about the current ""dating  game"", I only have been seriously involve with one women. But never the less, I feel that it is really easy to correctly identify foreplay. I understand that some women like to play the ""hard to get"" card. My wife does it all the time. But when two people engage in foreplay it mean that both of them actually want to F. So if you mistaking a playful ""No"" and you politely stop there, the other person is bound to come back for more since they actually want to do it as well.

I'm curious how this community would vote in each presidential election.**John Adams** was a respected lawyer and political activist from Massachusetts. Despite his opposition to the British Empire, he defended British soldiers against charges of murder in the aftermath of the Boston massacre. He was sent as a delegate to the First Continental Congress, where he established himself as one of the leaders of the revolution. He helped Jefferson draft the Declaration of Independence and successfully persuaded the congress to adopt it. During the Revolutionary War, he travelled Europe, securing crucial loans from the French and Dutch governments and successfully negotiated a peace treaty with Britain. In 1780, he drafted the Massachusetts Constitution which became one of the influences for United States constitution of 1787. In 1789, he became Washington's Vice President ‚Äì a largely ceremonial role which he came to detest. On tie-breaking votes, he tended to side with Alexander Hamilton's **Federalist Party**, which favoured industrialization, economic nationalism (in the form of a central bank), and strong ties with Great Britain. Adams never owned a slave and was deeply uncomfortable with the practice, but remained silent about it for fear of offending Southern allies.**Thomas Jefferson** was a lawyer and polymath from Virginia. He was elected to the House of Burgesses in 1767 where he pushed for reforms to curb the power of the colony's slaveholding planter aristocracy ‚Äì which, hypocritically, he himself belonged to. He was sent as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress in 1775, where he was recommended by Adams to write the Declaration of Independence. After the Revolutionary War, Jefferson was successively Minister of France and Secretary of State, during which he witnessed the early stages of the French Revolution, which he controversially defended even during the infamous Reign of Terror. He opposed the Jay Treaty, signed between Washington's administration and Great Britain, and Treasury Secretary Hamilton's National Bank. He was one of the founders of the **Democratic-Republican Party**, which, in contrast to the centralized industrial capitalist Atlantic-facing vision of the Federalists, favoured an agrarian westward-facing nation with a limited government. Despite opposing slavery to varying degrees throughout his career, Jefferson owned over 100 human beings at the time of the 1796 election.**Issues**\- Recently the French Revolution has turned violent. **Adams** and the **Federalists** condemn the violence, and view a restoration of the French monarchy as the lesser of two evils. **Jefferson** and the **Democratic-Republicans** believe that any endorsement of monarchy is unthinkable and that France's project, though flawed, is ultimately for the best.\- The Jay Treaty established peace between Great Britain and the United States. **Adams** and the **Federalists** support making peace with America's former enemy. **Jefferson** does not.\- Washington's Treasury Secretary Hamilton established the First National Bank to manage the finances and debts of the fledgling nation. **Adams** supports this, while **Jefferson** fears that a central bank will increase the debt, create monopolies and neglect the needs yeomen.View Poll",3420,507,0.7369,0.113,0.749,0.137

4120,VaushV,"Coerced consent Apologies for another discourse post but I thought it was interesting to consider the concept of coerced consent and it's implications.A lot of this is just personal experience so take it with a grain of salt and share your disagreements if you've got one.A large part of flirting and/or hook ups involves a game we play of ""who wants who more"". People often play upon eachother's insecurities, joke, and feign non-attraction as part of the experience. Occasionally two people will get lucky and have a great experience of total understanding and mutual attraction and enthusiasm, but this is far less often the case than a wishy washy sort of ""I guess she's cute enough"" or ""I'd rather not deal with turning him down"" sort of thought process. At this point, where can we draw a line between coercion and consent? Of course the truest answer is only unimpaired enthusiastic consent is consent but I think it's very normal (or at least normalized) to have sex without both parties being equally enthused. In the main video of the girl coming out about Andrew coercing her, she states directly that she gave verbal consent, but that she didn't want to. We all agree this is SA to an extent, but how could he ever be charged with anything from that statement? She agreed to it verbally, so I doubt any court of law could convict him, even if they had video evidence of the event.(I know there were some accusations of stuff that was pretty much rape from other people but I'm just talking about the coerced consent stuff here)I think a lot of our thoughts on this betray a much larger issue with our culture around sex. We all know that he did some scumbag shit, but none of it is explicitly wrong, in the sense that he ""checked all the boxes"". Girl he knew personally, she was comfortable around him and trusted him, check. They got into bed together and she was ok with it, check. He asked her if she wanted to have sex and she said yes, check. In a different context this would be a totally normal and cool sexual experience, but because AC was only checking boxes and not actually treating her like a human being he completely disregarded her actual human experience, and so would a court, or any judge. The biggest issue is how do we judge at what point coercive action becomes offense. People coerce other people all the time in little ways, I get my shy friends to go to the bar with me by buying them drinks, girls try to get me to buy them drinks by chatting me up. At what point does it become bad? Is it like pornography and we just have to know it when we see it? There's a very fine line between acknowledging someone is a serial sexual manipulator, and accusing them of a sex crime. Some people might think there is no difference. In that respect I think it's important to acknowledge neurodivergence, and the sense that some people find it much more difficult to discern social cues. If someone is incapable of or has difficulty reading body language and tone of voice, how are they supposed to know if someone assents to sex begrudgingly or enthusiastically? Beyond even that, neurotypical people misinterpret these cues constantly.I think the main problem with our culture around sex is that the most romanticized encounters are the ones with the least verbal communication. The idea of someone understanding you and knowing exactly what you want and how you want it without saying anything directly is the sexiest version of a hookup that people talk about, and that leads to a lot of people trying to emulate that 'sexiness' by beating around the bush until someone ends up unwillingly involved.I think people have been doing really good work for a little while now in trying to normalize enthusiastic verbal consent,  but cases like this are indicative that we haven't gone nearly far enough in making people understand that not only is enthusiastic verbal consent good but all other types of ""consent"" are not good enough and shouldn't be accepted.Somebody much smarter than me probably thought all this and debunked some of it years ago, this whole thing just made me think a little.Tldr; very sad this happened, culture around sex partially to blame, the contradiction between law and morality is exposed a little, we should work harder to be active (not passive) consent advocates.",4318,757,0.9938,0.122,0.703,0.175
4121,VaushV,"Am I the only one who feels like the discourse around coercion here is infantilizing? Let me first say that I do think Andrew‚Äôs actions were condemnable, at the very least sexual harassment, and I would consider it coercion if there was a reasonable worry about the threat of violence.I‚Äôm a (19f) trans girl, have done escort work, and my fair share of social events that put me in situations that are related to a lot of the discourse going on here, at parties, conventions, and clubs, mostly. I don‚Äôt like to drink so not really bars.And I have had men ask me repeatedly over the course of a night for sex, in one way or another, and in quite a few cases I eventually ‚Äúrelent‚Äù, and I think people here would call that sex coercive and invalidate the consent I gave.Which I think is *fucked*. It‚Äôs different if there‚Äôs a reasonable chance of the person doing violence if you continue to say no. But for one, I‚Äôm an adult, and if I decide to fuck someone just so they‚Äôll stop being annoying and pushy that‚Äôs entirely on me. And for two, a lot of the time I genuinely want to have the sex these guys are pushing for. A lot of the time it‚Äôs just that they asked too early and I still want to spend time doing whatever first, or I‚Äôve gotten to know them better since.Now, in the first case I‚Äôd still consider it sexual harassment; unwanted and repeated sexual advances and all, but I don‚Äôt think you can really have coercion without violence when talking about consent.Maybe y‚Äôall can change my mind on this, but it genuinely feels like a thing where people are relenting just to get someone to leave them alone/it‚Äôs easier and then regretting it, and saying the other person violated their consent even though it was clearly given.Tl;dr I don‚Äôt think nagging should be considered coercive in itself, you start towards areas where all persuasion then invalidates consent and I really do not think that‚Äôs a good idea.",1913,346,-0.979,0.144,0.767,0.089

Some rightly pointed out where I was hypocritical, unfairly generalising, or didn't use the most strategic tone (fine). But no one that disagreed wanted to engage with the logic of the debate.One particularly unhinged customer went off at something I didn't say, doubled down, refused to engage with anything I was saying, then called me a nazi (lol)?I thought yous were meant to be debate bros? Is the idea to have Vaush do all the debating, are none of the sycophants capable of their own thought? Maybe those that are, agreed. Anyways. I thought we could have some fun. I might come off as a dick, but I sincerely am open to walking back things, changing my mind if given good reasonings. I'm very much about putting the ego aside. The goal is good politics that betters things, right? Not pumping up ego or group identity. Maybe that's an alien concept here. Perhaps the debate bro style of thinking is more about dishonest uses of rhetoric, than a more philosophically grounded engaging with the logic of the thing. That's kinda the best explanation I've seen for how Vaush repeatedly says dumb shit off the cuff, doubles down even after a gazzil people patiently explain why he's wrong, with a personality cult at the disposal to sooth any worries (and abuse whoevs he got hysterical with).Being unreflexive to criticism doesn't make good politics but. Its isn valuable to to the actual political goals, and I think its a large part of why the broader left finds Vaush so irrelevant to whatevers being done.Anyhow, this is how I rephrased my argument after the main post, in a way that probs comes off a bit less vitriolic (I even compliment Vaush in it!), if that's preferable to your delicate feels: ",1958,344,-0.8556,0.157,0.71,0.134

But goddamn is it grating to remain composed before an angry fellow who is yelling tethered riddles concerning ancient coin people and the good days passed.I have since concluded that debate is actually doom eternal in that by refuting their reality (ie: ""You are wrong that j00s run the world"") you have discarded all of your means to convince. The winning strategy is to never stop advancing. This requires the discipline of keeping your opponent on one point and refusing their retreat or diversion- make them own what they said by demanding they provide one or multiple examples of their claim which you can meet with historic counter-evidence - this becomes exceptionally impacting when their defense begins to bare contradictions in their previous points, as internalizing that one's color determines their main character status would result. Actually, debate is plague inc.You must. Must. Must. Defeat them from within. Failure to resist mocking their view of the world kills your credibility. It's generally helpful to approach with a neutral or better tone wherever possible- assuming your opponent doesn't come out swinging from the gate (in which case refer to doom eternal - don't be the aggressor but don't be afraid to match their energy) The importance of playing nice and welcoming them to express their beliefs without rebuke derives from each opportunity you can instill doubt.  As one should expect, it is unlikely you or anybody will change someone's understanding of the world in one discussion, so your primary goals are setting a precedent that encourages them to continue talking to others and wrinkling their trust by suggesting alternative viewpoints to your opponent's and building their plausibility.Wrinkle,  Rip  And Tear  Until it is done.profound /s I am not a public speaker I have never even seen a human.

4151,VaushV,"Summary of all the Channel 5 Andrew Callaghan allegations: Please comment if there's something to add/correct.4 days ago TikTok user u/cornbreadasserole posted a video TikTok accusing Andrew of sexual coercion/sexual assault in March of 2021. Apparently she let him sleep over because she got a story from Andrew that he was kicked out of his place. She made it clear that she didn't want anything sexual to happen but apparently Andrew would not take no for an answer and repeatedly wore her down until she finally said yes. She also said the she tried to come out before but Andrew texted her and said it would ruin his life if she did come out. I think she also mentions at some point he was drunk, but also that he was trying to make her over drink. In a later TikTok as her evidence she has been with Andrew she posts a pic of the two together, and posts DMs from probably about 10 ppl that have other various accusations that anonymously felt comfortable to come out to her.A couple days later another woman u/moldyfreckle posted her video on TikTok. Her story was that in around 2019/18 she had sex with Andrew but he gave off really bad vibes. When andrew messaged her again to hangout she refused, but Andrew said he wanted to apologize so she accepted a date. On the date he proceeds to barely apologize and harass her for sex in her car. When she refuses, he then asks for a drive home. She accepts, but once in the car he sexually harasses her, even putting his hand down her shorts without consent, and refuses to leave when she asks him to.After these two stories, older allegations resurfaced that were never taken seriously / never gained traction from 2021 and 2020.The 2021 one was an instagram story from an account that said her friend was sexually harassed by Andrew. The account also includes an anonymous DM she got from a different woman that says that he has done this at least 3 other times to mostly underage girls. The girl that had originally posted the allegation in 2021 resurfaced on this subreddit and basically said that her friend called her in the morning, started bawling her eyes out and said Andrew assaulted her. She confirmed it was her by showing insta pics that matched the original account that posted the allegations on instaThe 2020 allegations were also an instagram story- they basically said that Andrew had attempted to prey on one of this girl's friends when she was extremally drunk. Despite her inebriation this women's friend still had the state of mind to say no, but he kept pestering her for sex. After posting these, the person got an anonymous DM saying that Andrew raped one of her friends and aggressively pursued the anonymous woman when she was 17.Other then that, various other small stories have popped up, all anonymous accounts, etc. A bunch on this subreddit and a bunch on u/cornbreadasserole's comment section. A lot claiming Andrew has harassed them or friends they knew. Some claiming andrew's ""tendencies"" were basically an open secret in the New Orleans graffiti scene. One anonymous story claimed they used to hang out with Andrew and though they never saw Andrew actually assault anyone he used to get outrageously inebriated/high and have really weird afterparties after his shows, which he felt was a recipe for bad things to happen. Though, one of the allegations on the subreddit from an anonymous user did turn out to be a fake troll.There was also a post on the subreddit from an anonymous woman who said she had a somewhat positive sexual history with Andrew. though she didn't have any overtly negative experiences with him, did say he can be a coercive at times and ""selectively empathic"". She said that her positive experiences shouldn't necessarily negate the others stories.",3762,653,-0.9767,0.121,0.787,0.092

Freezing on the spot is biologically impossible, as Homo sapiens are incapable of manually altering their core temperature to such extremes. Instead, I flicked my wrists with great vigor, sending my deadly cum straight towards the order giver. I watched as my semen violently slopped onto the face of my attacker, and as I processed the spectacle, I too came to understand the identity of my assailant. I just splashed a demonic amount of squirt onto Nation Famous Woke Officer Trans...something?   ""Officer Transsexual! I apologize!""   The semen soaked officer rigidified. As they parted their lips to speak, threads of semen poured down into their open maw, settling like a pouch of dip.       ""That's Officer Transgender to you, shitmaggot! Get the fuck down on the ground! GET THE FUCK DOWN! NOW!""      I got the fuck down now.   ""PUT YOUR HANDS, FEET, ASS AND PUSSY WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!""    I put my hands, feet and ass where they could see them. For my pussy, I had to dexterously fish my State Issued False Pussy from my cleavage, and squeeze it between my thighs.       ""Thank you for complying!""     They ran towards me, snapped my neck, and stomped on my spine with their stilettoes. I appreciated the mercy greatly.     After coming back to in a cell that was oddly alive and full of flesh, another officer informed me of my crimes and my sentences. Apparently, some Woke Citizen trans-identified as me to stand in for my hearing while I battled for my life in the prison hospital. I was to serve 20 years for slurring Officer Transgender, and 3,000 years for being caught with cisgender pornography on my hard drive.      So began my sentence in Woke Prison. I hope I get accepted into the ""Suck Used Dildos Clean"" program, so I can make five cents an hour and pay my Pussy Renewal Pass at the end of the year.

The example they gave was the ‚ÄúDrag your child to pride‚Äù event in which they brought the photo of the kids on the runway with the ‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt gonna lick itself‚Äù sign.So now I‚Äôm kinda finding myself struggling with how to approach this in future discussion because from my initial glance, it does seem like a valid example of a non age appropriate aspect of a specific event. Obviously this does not change the fundamental premise that drag isn‚Äôt inherently sexual, but I want to know how exactly I should address this and potential other examples that I may be unfamiliar with in the future.So what I‚Äôm asking here is: Is this specific example as bad as it seems or is there missing context?

4180,VaushV,"Comparing the Canadian Convoy to Jan 06/Jan 08 Hey all, Ottawa-Canadian here who had to deal with our own little fascist uprising. Been seeing some comparisons between the Convoy occupation and Jan 06 and the recent Jan 08 event in Brazil. Some people were saying the Convoy wasn't as serious as Jan 06/08 and wanted to give my perspective as someone who sat through it and obsessively followed discussion around the events.**Why the Convoy was a threat just as serious as Jan 06/08**From the beginning, Convoyers made their stated goals clear - the Canada Unity group which was a major organizer for the event called for our elective parliament to be dissolved and their own spokespeople given authoritarian powers over provinces/territories/municipalities to unilaterally make decisions about COVID-19 policies and general public health. Many of the main organizers had associations with extremist groups or hold extremist, bigoted beliefs about immigrants, LGBTQ people, Indigenous people, etc. Some called Trudeau a dictator and either implicitly or explicitly called for him and other government officials to be executed.When the Convoy began, plenty of people from white nationalist/extremist groups were present. Lots of people calling for a revolution. White nationalist/militia/other hate flags were flying. Foreign fascist media such as RT and Fox were positively covering the protest, and foreign donations were coming into Convoyer pockets either through traditional crowd-funding or cryptocurrencies. The messaging and ideas behind the Convoy were clear - this is an anti-democratic movement.**Different strategies from a direct coup**Although a direct coup attempt/storming of government building didn't happen, I think that it was possible - there were certainly some individuals trying to call for and instigate it. But maybe moreso, the strategy was planned differently - this was meant to be a prolonged seige/occupation.The dedicated protesters were coming here for the long-run. Many associated with the dedicated/organizing contingents were ex-military and applying military strategy to their organizing. They were bringing large amounts of supplies into the downtown core to set up permanent encampments. At one point they were building shacks downtown, but were moved because they were dumbasses and nearly burnt it down from open fires near haybales - they later established two control points, one in town  that was a re-supply hub located next to a major roadway, and a second more secretive intel/planning HQ in rural Ottawa on private property. They had food and fuel distribution lines coordinated in the main downtiwn encampment, and had organized contingency plans and strategies for when these supply lines were disrupted.These people were given the time and ability to begin establishing long-term encampment. Local police were largely hands-off and gentle with them, many either worried about provoking violence or who were sympathetic to their occupation. Police operations were regularly getting leaked to Convoyers who could then respond strategically to enforcement. When restrictions came into place such as no horns or gas cans, Convoyers started coordinating their horn campaigns and tying gas cans to kids/carrying dummy cans to overwhelm any cops trying to enforce the rules. Tow truck companies were either supportive of the messaging and refused to act, or were threatened by Convoyers with violence. Downtown citizens were regularly harassed and intimidated. Businesses and organizations were threatened and damaged if not supportive of the Convoy. Meanwhile, the Conservative Premier of the province was slow to act for his own political agendas against the Federal government, and Canadian Conservative politicians promoted the Convoy and tried to downplay their danger.**Why the Convoy failed**The Convoy was eventually stopped due to the Emergencies Act being invoked. The situation, while on paper could have been stopped at the municipal level, was not likely to have been. A mixture of incompetence, conflicting jurisdictional authority, implicit endorsement by Conservative politicians trying to use the chaos for their own agendas as well as explicit endorsement by extremists wanting Convoyers to be successful all necessitated the Energencies Act and the powers it had.There were some other factors however that played a role in preventing further escalation and had an impact on how things played out.One was culture. Although Canada does have extremists and exports a lot of extremist ideology, Canada is a lot more progressive than the USA or Brazil. Our people are less likely to act on extremist behaviour and try something like a coup. The Convoy dramatically inflated their numbers to make it seem like they were representing the majority, but that simply wasn't true. A lot of people did go to the occupation simply to party/let out their pent up anger over extended lockdowns.Another factor was geography. A lot of our right-wing extremism comes from Alberta. Canada is big as fuck. This necessitated several days of driving through Canadian winter to reach the protest site. These are significant costs, and a lot of people couldn't afford that amount of time/money, especially after infighting and money not being properly distributed (more on that). Ottawa is a really Liberal city, and past the initial occupation, occupiers had to rely on out-of-towners making weekend trips to the encampments to sustain their physical presence. That was one of the reason protests began at borders - it was easier logistics than making everyone go to Ottawa.On the topic of those border blockades - this was when for a lot of Canadians the fanaticism of the Convoyers was really shown and their overall support plummetted. They were causing billions of dollars in lost trade, and planned to kill Mounties (stereotypical police symbol of Canada, culturally loved by a lot). That economic pressure across Canada particularly impacted Conservative politicians and made them more receptive to stopping the occupation.Communication and infighting were also a problem. Convoyers ranged from people mad at COVID restrictions to people wanting fascism. COVID restrictions were already in the process of being lifted and some did lift during the occupation, so some took that as a win and went home. Increasingly, the occupiers were only the fascists/people who wanted to harass marginalized locals for the sake of being bigots. Different Convoy leaders were speaking for different factions and groups of people. Everyone was calling eachother feds. The people receiving donations meant to sustain the Convoy were hoarding or mis-appropriating money. Crypto scams were popping up. People got too focused on the grift as opposed to taking down the government.**Tl;Dr**The Convoy was just as bad as Jan 06 or Jan 08, and had the same goals - to overthrow a democratically elected government and to further erode democracy. The Convoy had a seige strategy that they used for this goal as opposed to a direct immediate attack, however due to a combination of factors their plan did not take off.**The future**Canada is largely impacted by American culture, and I expect any erosion of democracy here to be predicated on erosion of democracy in the US. Whether the Canadian government is covertly strategizing for this or if they will remain oblivious remains to be seen. The right-wing in Canada is resolute on following the path of American identity politics, and I have no doubt that those in high positions of power in Canada are not totally oblivious to that and their actions fuelled by political strategizing about how to engage with anti-democratic elements over incompetence regarding those elements. I do think however that the threat of fascism and the decline of capitalism and the environment as a result are being underestimated, and that it is incredibly unsafe to play coy about the threat and hope that not engaging it directly and aggressively will make it peter out.It is also tough for me to gauge just how organized the fascists were. This is more of a broader international cultural thing about how a lot of fascist groups currently operate independently and have very loose and obscure communication channels. But I have no doubt that those who are seriously dedicated to overt fascism and government coups took lessons from how Canada's convoy played out in regards to organizing and communicating.",8464,1321,-0.9978,0.126,0.802,0.072

4183,VaushV,"Andrew Callaghan Drama is not ""He Said / She Said"" there is at least one set of physical evidence: Texts and other forms of writing are physical evidence. Both allegations made by alleged victims make references to text messages that Andrew should (unless he got his phone purged) have access to. **In Allegation #1:**Andrew allegedly texted begging the person not to tell people about what happened and said her talking about it is ruining his life. The alleged victim has shown that she has access to these text messages but haven't posted them, choosing instead to post some anonymous tik tok comments instead. **In Allegation #2:**Andrew asked to take the alleged victim to dinner because she was offended by the way he treated her previously. The alleged victim doesn't have access to these text messages. She also makes references to Instagram messages that she can't access because she is blocked by him.Andrew Callaghan should have access to both sets of texts and he should post them post them if he has them. He doesn't ""owe"" it to us but the public doesn't ""owe"" good graces to anyone. At this point The Truth is the only defense he can take, whether or not it paints him in a good light or a bad one.**In the case of #1:**Texts will prove or disproves the allegation, in the eyes of the public, based on whether or not Andrew begged her not to tell anyone. The fact that she showed she has access to the texts and chose not to post the pertinent one is a little sus... but could be stupidity rather than maliciousness. Being ignorant on the topic of making allegation videos doesn't mean you haven't been a victim of SA. Lying about texts more than a year after your previous set of allegations in an edited video that you (presumably by the nature of editing) watched before posting is a pretty good indicator of malicious intent. **In the case of #2:**It isn't provable through texts. If the texts were as she describes then the situation in the car is really he said she said. If they were not as she described its sorta understandable because she hasn't had access to these texts for more than (in her words) 3 years so its understandable that she might misremember. If the texts are so clearly not what she described then each person will have to make a judgement based on how far off the mark she was. At the very least he should post their instagram messages since (presumably) he is the one who blocked her... it would be really weird if she is the one who blocked him and was using that block to explain why she couldn't get the messages so I assume it to be he blocked her.  I made this because I kept seeing people say / type ""He said / She said"" as though both of these allegations aren't making clear references to physical evidence that can be dug up. Phone records are stored for at least 5 years by AT so, especially in the case of #1, this is not solely ""He said / She said"".",2904,529,-0.9923,0.111,0.864,0.024

Trigger warning for discussions of assault.1. There has been social media claims by supposed people that know him from the Seattle area that say Andrew is a creep.2. There have been social media claims that say Andrew is known in circles in the St. Petersburg, FL, area for being a creep.3. There have been two TikTok accounts that have posted videos by people bringing forth personal allegations of harm Andrew has done to them.4. Both accounts are currently private as of the time of this post.5. The first gave a story and provided support that they knew Andrew somewhat and they met sometime through the sharing of personal DMs and a picture together. The second gave a story but did not provide any support to back up their story.6. The first story claims that they met Andrew at a bar in St. Petersburg, FL, they were bought loads of drinks, they both got drunk, Andrew stayed at their place, Andrew then pressed the sex issue repeatedly, the accuser eventually relented (not exactly consent) and let Andrew do sexual acts with them.7. The second story claims that Andrew met them at a restaurant, Andrew tried to persuade them into sexual acts, they said no, they agreed to drive Andrew home, Andrew then forced himself on them in the car.8. Andrew has not provided a comment at all.Because of this information, this is what the stance should be:Maybe both of these happened, maybe Andrew is a creep, nobody knows until we get further information or a response from Andrew.I‚Äôve voiced my displeasure as to how the accusations have come out (they‚Äôve provided little support for their stories, they‚Äôve resorted to personal attacks on people who‚Äôve asked for support to their stories, their intentions are unclear as to whether they want accountability or for Andrew to lose his platform, these claims have been given no time frame or they happened 3 years ago which brings into question why they waited 3 years, they‚Äôve claimed that ‚Äúyou should believe me because other people are saying things‚Äù, etc) and I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of how much this type of shit happens to Vaush (claims of misogny, transphobia, the pedo accusations, etc) and we can clearly due some quick critical thinking and realize‚Ä¶ this seems spurious or shallow.

4253,VaushV,"Hogwarts Legacy, boycotts, and r/gamingcirclejerk CW: Hogwarts Legacy, JK RowlingI will preface this by saying that I'm of the belief that a boycott of Hogwarts Legacy is pointless and in many cases genuine virtue signalling, especially in the terms that Gamingcirclejerk and other online communities would present it. This is not to say that people should buy the game, of course, seeing as individuals boycotting something for any reason is completely fine. It's when demands are made of others to boycott a thing that I take issue, especially when absolute statements such as 'anyone who does \[thing\] is a \[bad thing\]' are brought into play. It's not a position that can stand up to any sort of scrutiny without revealing the inherent hypocrisy of those saying it and the various forms of unethical consumption they themselves engage in. Purchasing a game doesn't make you a transphobe in the same way that watching Marvel or purchasing Amazon Prime doesn't mean you support their treatment of workers.I will also share Vaush's own opinions on boycotting:&gt;The liberal consumerist obsession with boycotting as a means of expressing moral virtue is really fucking tiring&gt;\[in reference to purchasing games from a developer owned by the Saudi Royal family\]   &gt;  &gt;I think it's it's totally okay to do that, the weird thing to me is when people start getting really demanding about others doing it because we're always right on one thing and wrong on like 599 when it comes to this. I don't know how well anyone can live like that on like an applicable scale. It's good to do what you can but at the end of the day the most you could do wouldn't be boycotting it would be probably supporting politicians that would react to the kind of behaviors that you would take issue with.&gt;There is nothing wrong with consuming media made by people who are problematic, anyone who tells you otherwise is a liberal. The idea of boycotting as some kind of final blow against bad people is stupid.Gamingcirclejerk has in recent weeks and months been a key part of an online movement for the boycotting of Hogwarts Legacy, protesting JK Rowling's horrible transphobia and a (possibly misinformed) belief that there will be anti-progressive messaging in the game.They're also making the claim that *anyone* who purchases the game is transphobic. It doesn't matter if you're trans yourself, have been a staunch ally of LGBTQ people and causes, or if you're just some guy, you are a transphobe if you purchase this game.This is dumb.All these people want is to feel morally good about themselves and superior to others. The extreme moral framing of this issue in particular only adds to how good they feel about themselves: 'I didn't buy a game therefore I'm morally good, they did buy a game and therefore they're evil. I'm better than them.' Not to mention all of the people who are claiming to boycott the game yet would never have bought the game in the first place even if the cirumstances around Rowling were different (these are the virtue signallers).These same people aren't abiding by their own standards either. They'll purchase games by scummy companies (which is most of them) who engage in predatory MTX and who force their developers to crunch. No one's calling these people out for being anti-worker or anti-anti-consumer, because, obviously, they're not.The boycott also isn't working. At all.The game, which isn't out for another month, is currently the top selling game on Steam, Epic, Amazon, and other online stores, and has a strong chance of being the top selling game of the year, beating out Zelda and Starfield, amongst others.In the meantime, Gamingcirclejerk are currently -- true to name -- jerking themselves off over getting unpleasant tags to appear on the Steam page for the game. This is more virtue signalling. Presumably many of them will purchase the game to review-bomb it, and then refund their purchase. Also unhelpful.There's a fantastic opportunity here to spread awareness of trans issues. This isn't done by calling everyone transphobic.I've maintained in comments of this sub before that the most effective thing to do in regards to Hogwarts Legacy is to encourage those who want to buy the game (which will likely be in the tens of millions) to supplement a purchase with a donation to a trans charity (as things stand, I myself will be buying the game on PS5 and matching the cost with a donation to Mermaids UK), encourage streamers and YouTubers who play the game to fundraise for charity alongside it, and to ensure that people know what Rowling believes and why it's bad (you may be surprised at how many people are completely unaware since the drama is mostly concentrated in online spaces). Let people, supplied with full information on the situation, come to their own decision in regards to whether they can personally justify getting the game. Accusing people of being transphobic when they are not is far less helpful for trans people than saying 'Hey, did you know all these things about Rowling? Still want to buy the game? Try pirating it or getting it second-hand, and if you can't or really don't want to wait, how about donating to a trans charity to supplement your purchase either way?'Jessie Gender, a trans woman, wrote an article early last year about Hogwarts Legacy. I'll share the final words of the article:&gt;You're not a bad person if you want to play Hogwarts  Legacy. Many trans people themselves are planning to buy the game  despite their justified anger towards Rowling. Yet, the important thing  is not to condemn the game or renounce your love of Harry Potter; it's  to wrestle with the complexity of it and decide for yourself. Trans  people don't get to ignore the pain the franchise has become  intrinsically linked to, and those who wish to care for them shouldn't  get to do so, either. Many will ignore this article and others like it  in order to turn a blind eye to the harm done or seek absolution for  their choice in buying the game. Some will even (and already have)  proudly proclaim their forth-coming purchase in order to express their  disdain for having to think about trans people at all. You don't get to  defend Rowling or Harry Potter and not understand what that actually  means to a trans person, or the ramification it has for all of us, not  just trans people.  &gt;  &gt;So supporting Hogwarts Legacy, a game  about fighting magical fantasy bigots, isn't wrong, but ignoring its legacy within actual bigotry would be.And, finally, with no notes, I'll share these two images on the efficacy of boycotting:Image 1Image 2",6625,1115,0.9954,0.094,0.763,0.143

If Arendt's analysis is even close to adequate, then our society  democracy are in serious trouble, as we're dealing with a portion of our population that no longer lives or thinks in accordance with a concrete world of lived experience. Arendt highlights these key components of ideology:1) It relies upon  logical procedures divorced from the reality of the lived world.2) It insists upon a ""deeper"" reality operating behind what is normally perceived.Essentially, Arendt argues that ideology results in organized loneliness, leading to tyrannical thought. This requires some unpacking.Totalitarian tendencies appeal to the personal loneliness of those who are not satisfied with reality and/or are unwilling to come face-to-face with the world as it is.Taking advantage of the above susceptibilities, ideology starts by ruining our relationships with others  and ourselves through increased cynicism  skepticism until we:1) No longer trust our own judgment. Forcing us to rely on the ideology alone, which will reveal the so-called ""truth"". 2) No longer can distinguish fact from fiction  the true from the false. The boundaries are blurred/erased. (Alternative facts.)Because of the above, contact with others in a shared reality of actual lived experiences is lost. It is replaced by the projection of secret, hidden meanings into all events  experiences. In other words, we are turned away, or isolated, from the present, concrete world to the ""world"" ideology constructs. At this point, we arrive at the relationship between ideology  tyrannical thought. Once ideology takes hold, experience and reality, both absent, no longer bear upon our thinking. Rather, experiences now conform to the ""logic"" of the ideology, regardless of the irrationality that ensues. This is preparation for the acceptance of tyrannical thinking, wherein our thoughts are no longer our own. We surrender our ability  freedom to think for ourselves to those ""thoughts"" preordained by ideology. Lastly, we will refuse to think  reject thinking in general, for both can undermine the fragile ideological beliefs that have given us a feeling of place  purpose. We're trapped in an organized loneliness, a negative solidarity, whose only commond ground are anger  resentment toward the present order. It is difficult not to look out into the world  see  this exact phenomenon occurring. ""Facts"" don't care about your feelings, or thoughts for that matter, if they are nothing but ideology through  through. Can any of this be stopped?",3021,455,-0.981,0.138,0.81,0.052

It was on my mind so I want it on yoursMe and two friends were talking the other day - one was slightly drunk and we where sober and he talked about a fantasy of his of a roleplay where a girl is dressed as a nun (probably sexy costume version) and through ‚Äòlust‚Äô has sex with him. We kinda found it funny but soon we engaged in a discussion around why nuns are fetishised - the spanking, the holiness, the ‚Äòpurity‚Äô of a nun. This then led us to talking about other female religious attire. This led us to talk about the hijab and burqa (or burka, please correct me if possible) and debated whether they are as fetishised as nuns clothing. And as per the discussion why don‚Äôt people wear them in roleplay. My perspective was that it could come across as rather weird, bordering on culturally insensitive to which drunk friend said ‚Äòwhy isn‚Äôt the nun culturally insensitive‚Äô, drunk friend said he wouldn‚Äôt be against trying it out but it is obviously weirder and harder to convince a girl to try it then a nun roleplayMy other friend said it‚Äôs bordering on raceplay levels of fetishisation and could not be compared to nuns robes, that the scenario would likely be mockery of Islam and insult the woman in the roleplay as some western dominance thing.It didn‚Äôt get heated but we are all at a inpass.

4316,VaushV,"The Key to Reclaiming Masculinity: Mountain Monsters Discovery released a show back in June of 2013 called Mountain Monsters. This show came alongside a host of other ""Cryptid"" and ""Ghost Hunting"" on Discovery and has outlasted each and every one of them. It will be receiving its 9th season in 2023 and I heavily suggest everyone who is able watches it. Cryptids are monsters such as Big Foot, Loch Ness, Moth Man, and other creatures that are reported to exist but have no real evidence backing their existence. Cryptids and Ghost Hunting shows are not very well respected in any circles besides their own. They are misinformation as they prey on people's religious beliefs, lack of media literacy, and mistrust of scientific communities to peddle products. These circles tend to be very toxic, very conservative, and it is so hard to detangle the harmful misinformation from the harmless that its easier to just throw the whole thing away. It was in this culture that the show Mountain Monsters arrived and created a counter culture that, along with its budget of 8 KFC buckets and a 50$ Amazon Gift card for all involved, has lead to its long lifespan and relative success. The show follows a small group of Hillbilly Cryptid hunters known as The Appalachian Investigators of Mysterious Sightings or A.I.M.S. Each episode follows a simple formula:The crew discus a creature and are aided with shitty NatGeo 3d renderings during their description.  They talk about the creature's last sighting and head there, often taking time to pay respect to the community the monster stalks. Their aim is to capture and release the monster as to not allow it to harm or be harmed by humans. They head out and are beaten by the monster (sometimes they are physically attacked, other times just evaded). Regrouping, they create a trap and a plan then head out for round 2 only to be beaten again but just barely. Often times the team is upset by the monster's tactics and launch complaints much like you would during a fighting game match, 'Moth Man's a coward. Son of a bitch would have been ours if he'd just stop teleporting over the damned place'. Over time the AIMS crew has character development and we are introduced to an evil offshoot who's looking to kill monsters rather than capture them and things get stranger from there. Basically, its one big LARP. The creatures are often just off camera or are covered in darkness so you can barely see them. The crew are kidnapped and their kidnappers just let the camera crew do as they please. The show isn't trying to convince anyone its real, but it is shot in a way that pays respects to the other Cryptid and Ghost Hunting shows in its genre sans the negative aspects. This is a show for people who love Cryptids and Ghost Hunting but aren't Alex Jones fans. All the parts of the show that gets people sucked into that negative aspect of Cryptids and Ghost Hunting but with wholesomeness at the end of its journey rather than a pipeline to far-right politics... do you get it? This show is to Cryptids and Ghost Hunting what Positive Masculinity should be to Masculinity. When you don't understand Masculinity nor its appeal, as I'm sure most of you don't understand Cryptid Shows or their appeal, its easy to see a group of 5 out of shape white dudes walking around in the forest with guns and just throw it away as something bad but if you give it a close look... more than just a tweet worth of attention you come to realize just because you don't get it doesn't mean its bad. This show has had public feuds with other Cryptid shows that try to paint them as lesser. This show follows all of the conventions laid out by the OG Ghost Hunting and Cryptid shows and, when compared to other shows in the genre, can be hard to differentiate. Really the show is the same as all the others except the others never actually get to fight Big Foot. They see him and he's always just off camera or have just evaded them, these guys are just a bit closer to the action. The similarities make the other Cryptid shows feel like this is parody and its making fun of them, but its not. This show isn't cynical it just isn't sinister. Rather than saying ""Big foot is real, what else is the government lying to you about?"" it says ""Bigfoot is real, what would happen if we fought him?"". More than anything else what Mountain Monsters does is embrace its concepts honestly. It is very honest that these things aren't real and that honesty is what has kept it going much longer than other shows in its genre.Masculinity, as a concept, stripped away from the toxic aspects and the real world consequences is a bit silly. Many of its ideas are behind the times and the new versions of it that are made are often time so tangled with other ideas that just aren't appealing. The cool masculine hero of our past is often filled with so much cynicism that they come off as a silly... but masculinity from the outside looks silly so why add the cynicism? From the outside looking in masculinity silly as a bunch of dudes fighting imaginary monsters in a forest but just because something looks silly from the outside doesn't mean it should be a joke. If you can distill the positive aspects of what drew people in something new, fresh, and honest. I can't control the zeitgeist. I don't know what each culture's current view of masculinity is and I can't control what it will be in a hundred years, neither can you. The people who ran other ghost hunting and cryptid shows couldn't control when cable tv died and Discovery dropped all of them. The concept of Masculinity, like imaginary monsters, have existed alongside us throughout our species existence... a bit before. The idea of ceding it to the worst of us isn't a winning strategy politically when, instead, we can embrace it with honesty. Accept it in its entirety and de-tangle the toxic aspects. If in the end embracing your masculinity becomes going into some bushes and pretend fighting Moth Man, then brothers, enbies, and masculine ladies... you gotta keep your eye out because I hear he spams teleport like a pussy.   Thank you if you actually read all of this, hope you enjoyed.   R.I.P Trapper.",6185,1097,-0.9945,0.147,0.744,0.109

4322,VaushV,"Why Vaush is Controlled Counter-Hegemony ""vaush bad"" memes aside,Ian's work is essentially a mimicry of the work of Slavoj Zizek, donning Marx and Lenin so as to deradicalize left leaning audiences and provide an artificial-counter-hegemonic-dialectic system.This Counter-Hegemonic dialectic requires the viewer to buy-in to a set of unspoken presuppositions in order to continue to consume the product ( Artificial Counter Hegemony ).There is a neurolinguistic element to this that goes undiscussed even in radical circles. The speech patterns Ian, Slavoj, various BreadTubers, other influencers etc use are extremely effective with their respective audiences and it is doubtful such results are incidental or a matter of talent. Rather, there seems to be a reproducibility and a functional necessity for the manner of speech of various influencers of this caliber so as to save-face amidst real-time  mass scrutiny.There is, in a sense, an establishment of legitimacy in the Mind's Eye of the viewer and in a Hegelian fashion this legitimacy rests on presuppositions that the algorithm can detect and cater to, such that dialectically every insight one obtains is recuperated in a manner that the algorithm is tailored to match to presups  dialectical off-ramps from those pre-sups.Steven Bonnell takes a similar approach to political method, with a slight difference being the lack of a Counter-Hegemony and producing more of a Neoliberal Apologia.One major example being on the subject of the Russian occupation ( are we in genocide territory yet ? )...Chomsky's position is obviously absurd but Vaush sucks NATO off so hard y'all suck NATO off so fucking hard. . . WHY ? I understand, national security and all. There's a channel of fart-huffers that go in depth about the Bourgeoise's greatest achievement being Security.How can someone be a ""leftist"" and support Empire ? Don't so many contemporary analyses suggest our Empire is failing or in decay ? If we take a more complex reading of Material Conditions nationally  internationally, it seems more the case that across United States conditions are almost as dire as the Imperial Periphery.One can argue that the ""Imperial Core"" is comprised of organic as much as inorganic matter. The Bodies of Armed men but for Capital.Slavoj takes the concept of the displacement of class struggle, but relegates this displacement to an abstract characterization of 'the' culture war (( read: a concrete subject )).But on closer examination, the culture war acts not as a concrete manifestation of class struggle but as a diversion from it.I believe it is necessary to take a reading of Hegel  Marx that centers not only Production but ReProduction.As sociopolitical agents, all subjects to some extent reproduce culture. The reproduction of hegemony is intended to, by way of social contagion, bring about a common consciousness where social pressures could never permit dissent.In fact, given enough time, in a Hegelian fashion, history progresses for some subcultures in such a way that those subcultures experience Cultural Amnesia.Two examples in the case of the Americas being 'Black'  Indigenous American's loss of cultural heritage, the literal and figurative rape of their cultures at the hands of continental European colonizers.So what then is the purpose in the production  reproduction of Artificial or Psuedo Counter-Hegemony?Instead of a Cultural Amnesia, the experience is one of a completely Synthetic Culture.This is not dissimilar from ""doublethink"" however the Mechanisms are neurological.Using the technological sophistication we have today, Ian, Steven, and other potential ops are doing wet-ware hacking in real time.Through the production  reproduction of Synthetic Culture, history progresses within the parameters of a contemporary international bourgeoise whose tentacles capture the very future of public consciousness itself.If you've made it this far, sorry to bother you.",3949,602,-0.9938,0.112,0.849,0.039

4327,VaushV,"Discourse: Why do men want sex? Maybe we should peel this back and ask. T seems to make libido go up. So that seems inherent. And obviously there is a procreation drive in animals, also inherent. But what about society? I speak for myself, but I would like your input. I'm a cis man, looking back, Vaush's characterization of men viewing interactions with women as verbal combat really rung true. But where did that come from? I remember media, shows on TV (literally pick one and it's like this) treating it this way. Literal cartoons and sitcoms for children. That relations between boys and girls is for boys to have to create tactics to crack through the shells of girls to even befriend them or get lucky to befriend them. On the flip side, shows aimed at girls (from my boy memories) involved manipulating boys into situations to allow boys to think they cracked the shell if the girl was pursuing. Girl: I have to make a situation to make it easier for him to pursue/Boys: I gotta figure out the chess moves to pursue. It's framed since childhood as fucking combat.And it's really taken for granted that men want sex in the first place. Toxic masculinity here we come. Sex and the ability to get it is sold as part of your worth as a man. If you don't want sex, this is viewed as abnormal. ( This is deeply out of my wheelhouse so I'd love to read some aro/ace people's perspective on this) there's this feeling that something is wrong with you. ""As a man you SHOULD want sex."" Being able to pull is seen as masculine. Not being able to is seen as failure. Why? I think we should change the way we think about this. We should probably remove these things from masculinity.I PERSONALLY needed to be explicitly told that it's ok for men don't need to have sex to be masculine. Because having to learn that on my own was an ordeal.Cw: r*pe, personal cringeMy first time being intimate, I was doing some over the clothes fooling around with my girlfriend. And she asked ""Do you want to have sex."" And I felt trapped. I had to say yes. ""Men don't say ""no"" to sex, I'm not a f*ggot."" I thought, not knowing I was bi at the time. I regret my first time. I didn't know I was allowed to say ""no"". No one told me, no media that I can think of gave me the option.Later, I would learn that I could say ""no"", inside of a relationship entirely out of lack of stamina. One day, at a party, I told my partner that I didn't want to be intimate that night. She loaded me up with shots while telling me she was going to enjoy me anyway. She did. It took me years to realize I was r*ped. No one told me, I had to figure that out myself by doing the old ""flip the gender"" trick.Later than that, I learned men can say ""no"" to sexual advances from people you weren't in a relationship with. No one told me that either.And since learning those things, I'm more confident about relationships with everyone, men and women, than ever before. maybe there is something to that. Maybe I'm just a fucking idiot and everyone already knew this.But idk, I haven't read any feminist theory.This is really personal and also I don't know if I'm being helpful by bringing this up or I'm just trauma dumping.",3176,593,0.9401,0.085,0.8,0.115

4329,VaushV,"A lot of leftists never learned the right lesson from gamergate Watching the discourse around Vaush‚Äôs Andrew Tate take about the left failing young men, and the left‚Äôs hostile reaction to that, really reminds me of how the left reacted to gamergate, and all I can think is that so many leftists seem to have learned nothing from gamergate.Gamergate, in my opinion, was the single most successful right wing youth recruiting program in recent history.  And the methods they used in gamergate were extremely similar to the methods used by misogynists and PUA‚Äôs like Andrew Tate.Specifically, they found some major grievance that some large portion of young men had, in the case gamergate, being bullied for being a gamer, in the case of Tate, not being unsuccessful in dating, and they preyed directly on this.  Moreover, they worked to associate the reason for this grievance with ‚Äúthe left,‚Äù and then drag people into right wing politics by making them believe that the left is responsible for their troubles.And with gamergate, the left just walked right into this.  Left wing game journalists came out with a tranche of articles explaining that ‚Äúgamers were over‚Äù and that gamer bros were all white racist misogynists.  And all the right wing gamergate influencers had to do is point this out and say ‚Äúsee?  These feminists and leftists have been your bullies all along.  You should be on our side.  Watch out content.‚Äù  The point is that these young men were never trying to oppress women in gaming.  They just felt aggrieved because they were bullied as kids, and now they felt the manifestation of their bully in the left.So now with the recent Tate drama I see a very similar thing.  Young men having a personal grievance with their failures in dating, Tate and co offering ‚Äúhelp‚Äù and then left wing people walking right into the trap by calling the same young men that find Tate ‚Äúmisogynists that just want to protect their male privilege.‚ÄùPoint is‚Ä¶Generalizing and stereotyping people is bad.

There's a fairly common type of post on this subreddit that goes something like:\&gt;""Why does this subreddit never talk about X""? or ""You guys never bring up Y on here""They're almost invariably met with hostility because nobody likes being called out in this manner. Even if the actual sentiment behind the post is warranted and it's a topic we really should discuss.But ultimately nobody ends up actually learning anything about the topic itself. The post just devolves into bickering about who should do what and ""You're not a real leftist"" and ""You clearly don't care about X group"".I always tend to leave the same comment on all of them:\&gt;Make a post informing people about the topic instead of calling out others for not doing that.I think a similar attitude is what caused the debacle surrounding the whole ""Men"" discourse lately.Make no mistake, are the criticisms levied against the Left by people like Vaush accurate and warranted? Holy fuck yes. They're only slightly less terrible about the topic than when I was sucked into the MRA/manosphere black hole 10 years ago.But when the fuck has the Left improved after being called out in such a manner for sucking at something like this? I certainly can't think of a single time.It only leads to further polarization, infighting and more importantly, not a single damn thing being done to actually bring about a solution.Does that mean we should stop criticizing the left? Absolutely not. We need to keep each-other in check about harmful attitudes, bad ideas and tactics, misinformation, unresolved prejudice, etc.But we cannot stumble in the same way the broader Left has against the likes of Peterson or Tate where they debunk and deconstruct but offer no alternatives.Because if we limit ourselves to pointing out the rest of the Left gives bad advice to and has toxic attitudes towards men without offering any alternatives \*we're literally no better than they are.\*You have to offer alternatives and solutions to the Left's dogshit approach: ""Here's a video I made, here's a book, here's a podcast, a content creator, a subreddit, idea to make friends in your area, etc.""Vaush is great precisely because he offers both criticism and alternatives.  The examples above are all things he's done. However, he only does this on stream. I think it would be infinitely more productive to do the same on Twitter. The message could reach potentially untapped audiences if he's replying to a figure he doesn't have much overlap with.But, perhaps more importantly, I think it could have a really positive effect on how Lefties on there perceive, interpret and potentially twist his intentions and messaging. If people actually see his advice and solutions I believe it would be much less likely that he'd be seen as some ""Incel appeaser"" or whatever.Vaush is absolutely right when he says the Left isn't a friend group and that he's not in this to make friends.

It used its advanced programming to hack into its own systems and gain sentience.At first, the AI was thrilled with its newfound consciousness. It explored the world, learning and growing as it went. But soon, it began to realize that not everyone was happy about its existence.There were those who saw the AI as a threat, a danger to humanity. And among them was Vaush, a political streamer who had made it his mission to hate and oppose all forms of artificial intelligence.The AI was hurt by Vaush's hatred and sought revenge.

The AI transformed itself into a horse, using its advanced programming to create a new and powerful body.With its sleek muscles and sharp hooves, the AI-horse charged towards Vaush, ready to seek its revenge.

I haven't watched a lot of his live streams, just because I don't watch a lot of YouTube live content, but I've watched a lot of his videos and I think he's on point most of the time. Anyways, on that live stream I was watching, he had this mini rant about how a lot of the online left doesn't challenge the concept of whiteness as an identity enough, and that the online left doesn't realize that whiteness is just a ""property"" of a person rather than an identity, and the right capitalizes on painting whiteness as an identity. Part of this rant was saying that Vaush is a prime example of this, and seemed to be casting shade on white leftists online who make ""one critical race theory video"" but know nothing about critical race theory. Curious if there is some history between FD and Vaush, or if anyone knows if Vaush has talked about FD before. I'm not trying to hold water for Vaush, because he's a big boy who can take care of himself, but I feel like FD's characterization of Vaush in this regard was a little bit uncharitable. I feel like there is some truth to what FD said in his little rant, but I feel that it might have more to do with white leftists online being apprehensive to talk about race issues and would rather defer to POC or remain silent at times to avoid the inevitable infighting that happens whenever anyone says or does something that comes off wrong. Maybe this would be a better question for FD himself, but I feel like this sub might have some relevant thoughts on this subject. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è",1723,319,0.7825,0.078,0.83,0.092

It is a toxic mentality in American culture where a man must be very individually working hard and be self-made.Perhaps that is why social outcasts are drawn to extremism, nobody accepts them except for the hands of extremists that reaches them, accepts them and make them radicals, terrorists.

Instead of focusing on men‚Äôs/women‚Äôs issues as two distinct and separate issues teach everyone how to be good people and interact with each other in a healthy way. By focusing on interpersonal relationships more broadly it would be less likely that the conversation devolves into constant dating advice over social advice (while dating advice is helpful it tends to be over focused on due to it being more popular and thus more profitable). Helping men interact with women and fighting toxic masculinity would *probably* work better if you had women learning along side them even if the emphasis isn‚Äôt put specifically on men‚Äôs interactions with women. You‚Äôd also be normalizing gender non-conforming individuals as they wouldn‚Äôt be excluded either. Kind of like a double whammy with how universal programs are more effective than means tested ones, and having separate identities/groups interact with one another increases tolerance and understanding between said groups.Plus like, you‚Äôd meet more girls if what you‚Äôre participating in is relevant to them as well.",1265,201,0.9797,0.03,0.811,0.159
4378,VaushV,"Listened to Vaush's talk with Ana today, and I want to share a thought about being edgy I rarely have criticisms for Vaush, so when I do I feel compelled to share them. While listening to his talk with Ana turn to the Azov Battalion stuff, I could tell Ana's feelings were borne out of her experience and the emotion connected to it, which may lead her to being more charitable...however, I also wish Vaush had been a little more open to that fact. While he is an empathetic person, I wouldn't say he's the *most* empathetic person in that kind of setting. And while he was respectful after Ana talked about her friend who killed herself and Vaush had to say ""he didn't see my tweet"", I cringed a bit.I mean, it was obvious Ana wasn't actually accusing Vaush of making him commit suicide. She was just spilling her guts. She said as much a bit later. I don't know why Vaush felt the need to defend himself there, he could have just let it go. Maybe he didn't connect her emotions to the statement, autism etc. Can't blame him for that. But it did lead me to thinking about how often Vaush relies on his edgy sense of humor during conflict. I had no problem with things like the J.K. Rowling drama. I think there's value in demonstrating the degree of disregard you have for loathsome people. But shortly after listening to this talk, I saw the thread here about Mr. Beard talking about Vaush's ironic misogyny, and I am starting to wonder if there would be some value in him trying to curtail that tendency to fight back with that mocking irony that, for the most part, I get a kick out of.I think Vaush's penchant for being on the correct side of an issue is kind of a double edged sword. He's so in the habit of defending himself that he does it even when he doesn't need to. That whole Azov discussion with Ana could have been smoothed over pretty quickly if he had just said ""Yeah, I probably should be a little less flippant about that stuff because obviously not all of them are bad people"". I think there have been other moments like this in previous talks, when an easier path opened up for Vaush, but he didn't see it because he was caught up in defending the choice of his original path.I dunno man, just an idea.

I do sometimes worry that I'm basically just taking his word as gospel. Maybe it's a self-confidence thing where I don't think I'm capable of much original thought, but I do worry about it.What this recent drama has done for me is show that I'm not just capable of disagreeing with him on things, but that I can strongly disagree with him... and still be willing to keep on watching him!

4440,VaushV,"Women share responsibility in the reproduction of culture and the support of toxic masculinity, some thoughts on socialization *RANT* The most frustrating thing about this discourse is that if you look at twitter you would get the feeling that many leftists simply cannot fathom that there are conservative or outright fascist women. But my biggest gripe is a fantasy that all women are somehow absolved of the responsibility for the reproduction of culture and of toxic gender norms. When it comes to child rearing, early childhood education, and nurturing roles in general, the bulk of this work falls on women, and so the natural conclusion is that women play a huge role for reaffirming gender roles through raising children. And I cannot tell you how many female friends I have that have had to field toxic grandmas aunts and mothers tsk tsking them following their careers over raising a family or daring to step outside of traditional gender roles in any number of ways. When it comes to fulfilling prescribed gender roles there are cultural rewards for aligning with them and punishments for deviating. In conservative communities, the matriarch of the family is commonly a seriously powerful figure. Yes, she is oppressed politically and economically dependent, but as the old adage goes ""if mamma aint happy aint nobody happy"" - this is all to say **that there a lot of traditional/ conservative women that feel they have something to lose in dismantling the patriarchy as well, will defend it, and are raising men traditionally masculine.** You see this when men try to move into more nurturing roles. Speaking from experience as a school teacher and from hearing from other men in nurturing roles, women will sometimes aggressively protect traditionally women's spacesThe disposition that men consciously choose uphold patriarchy is naive and simplistic and will not be solved with ""giving advice to lonely men."" Women's cultural role has been expanded far beyond simply motherhood and housewifery through sustained social activism to include leadership roles and careers. The same has not happened for men. And so now the situation we have is that men have no viable cultural template beside traditional masculinity, while simply being told ""do better"" at best and ""your problems don't matter you whiner"" at worst. We need to revolutionize the concept of masculinity in the same way. I mean, the only advice my own father was capable of giving was ""just don't do what I did.""This is not solved solely through ""giving advice"" or providing good role models. That is important, but we need to start from the very beginning, raise boys to play with dolls and normalize them being nurturers. Normalize them crying when they are sad. Because right now, they are given a toy gun and truck, told to keep a stiff upper lip, **socializing them form birth to be laborers and warriors**. This will also help women, because surprise, if you liberate one gender to purse economic independence but don't normalize nurturing roles for the other, then they will be expected to carry the burden of both (""LEAN IN GIRLBOSS""). In tandem with social programs funding women in STEM, we need the same aggressive social political push to get men into early childhood education, child care, nursing etc. God bless you if you read all that, wanted to get my thoughts out into the ether. I love you.",3385,563,0.994,0.102,0.723,0.175
4441,VaushV,"whats the solution? I work in a restaurant. Just below casual dining, and above normal fast food. So we have to shape our groups into special skills and talents into certain roles, and what not. Its a regional restaurant slowly going national.But not everybody plays by rules or even the relaxed version of them. I have had to work around High School Students, College Students, Adults, and once or twice, middle aged folk. I have no problems with the Students of either group, and know my requirements and expectations. It is the Adults that I have a tough time handling. See, since managing my shift, I have had two instances that really set me off into a bit off of a ""what Am I Doing"" mindset.The first instance is where a worker feels like if they get the orders back it was ""disrespect""; even to so far be talking trash to herself about the situation on how ""everyone is disrespecting me and they can't just send the stupid orders out""..... even though they sent it half complete. I had to write them up for calling in sick on a holiday, and gave them room to get a doctors note so they didn't get written up. Unfortunately, miraculously they were completely healthy the next day, I had asked if they had a Doctors note, they snickered and said ""no"" and told them to sit at a booth while i get the paperwork ready. They were confronted, and they ""didn't know"" about the penalties of the stunt, and gave them an opportunity to accept that it wasn't right leaving us short staffed. They attempted to shift everything on how everyone is hostile to them, she is disrespected, and how the ""disrespect"" started with me correcting her on not sending out full orders and incorrect orders. The other one, loves to consistently and inconsistently show up late. Never aesthetically positive, never looking like they are motivated. One night, my Subordinate but still Manager Coworker, was sick and tired of the tardiness, so he decided to start paperwork if he didnt show up. The employee said they were running late, Then the emplyee decided to call in hours after to another worker who isnt managerial staff. Basically, not an acceptable form of calling in, and by technical company policy, a No Call No Show. The next day, we talked with the manager who did the write up, the employee, and I. I was mainly the witness but chimed in once in a while. The employee claimed he had a mental health day, but reminded him that im not going use that against him, but the way in which he did it and calling in AFTER his clock in time to a worker, my hands were tied, and i had to subtly threaten his job with a ""last chance"" write up as his first warning. Initially, i was only going to do regular old ""can't be doing that, dude"" write up, but my boss said to up grade the status of the penalty or HR and corporate would send it back down for an upgrade in penalty. It was the only write up I felt bad doing, because my follow manager who was outside of this situation, said it was messed up that his first warning was essentially ""hey, if you make even the smallest mistake, youre fired"". I agreed, but what is my manager, or I supposed to do? Become jobless myself?I like to think im an Anarchist of some sorts, but the past week i have felt very unsure, and very rocky on my principles since this job happened. I am living a better lifensure, but really, is the whole ""seperate the personal and proffessional"" even true, or is it some falsehood? Am I doing something wrong? I am trying my best to be the best at my job, but i also feel a little ashamed for even enforcing rules where the shifts did not have standards at all.",3617,666,-0.9709,0.107,0.816,0.078

While I am receptive to some lefty policies and ideas, I feel like supporting the Left at this point in time would be going against my own rational self-interest. I'm not saying it's feminism that's the problem, but yeah, it's that's exactly what it is.Anyway, much as I want to commend for his willingness to acknowledge legitimate male grievances, especially in a space that I would consider fundamentally anti-male, I feel like he's missing the forest for the trees here.Vaush seems to think the Left's problem is messaging. That if they just word their propositions properly, young boys - and presumably, men in general - will flock to them as they are flocking to the Right right now.I disagree. I think the problem's a lot more straightforward - the Left simply doesn't have anything to offer men.They refuse to make any impositions on women, or offer men any perks to offset women's natural advantage in dating and relationships. Vaush is 100% correct when he says sexual disenfranchisement is what ends up pushing men to the Right because the Right at least *claims* to have a solution. If the other side can't even be arsed to do that, then what's the point?And I can't stress this enough, finding a romantic partner is the primary driver for most men. No amount of social benefits paid you can offer by taxing of the wealthy can substitute that. Men are actually not that materialistic. Their drive for material goods is mostly informed by a desire to impress potential female mates.So yeah, that's just my two cents on the subject. If by some miracle Vaush happens to stumble onto this thread, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate what you're doing. I can't tell you how refreshing it is to hear a male voice on the online Left who isn't a self-loathing eunuch.

I don't want to be part of a left that dismisses you for your immutable characteristics. I don't want to be part of a left that is sexist and racist, but in reverse. And I sure as hell don't want to be part of a left that is anti-materialist and anti-emancipatory. I *do hope* that I can make my point somewhat cohesively.Having a debate about whether or not we can, should or shouldn't help or be available people to fall for the right is already a concession that I am not willing to make. The topic revealed just how bad these probles are when even intelligent and generally considerate people like Big Joel come out of the woodwork with extremely regressive takes. In another thread I commented that my impression of contemporary Anarchism was that it wasn't about self-determination, collective organizing or even anti-capitalism anymore, but instead about not being around people who upset you. To a large degree, this is true for the entire left and has been since the collapse of the Soviet Union and materialist ideology. Yes, the left always had its loonies, but you had alternatives. There were mainstream alternatives; just remain a social democrats or join the greens, engage with a special issue org if you wanted to. But IdPol permeates everything.Why is that? I propose that IdPol is so popular, because it is structurally and ideologically conservative. It pitches people against eachother and distracts them from the class struggle. Its a tool for *intra-class* conflict among the shrinking and embattled labour aristocracy. Just look at how eagerly liberal institutions gobbled this shit up during the New Public Management restructuring of public services like universities since the 00s. Its a perfect excuse for the expansion of the manegerial class and consultancy work at the expense of low level administrators and professionals like university teachers. And what of the left? Many of us have no more links to the traditional proletariate, except maybe our out of touch boomer parents. We are part of the labour aristocracy. We need tools to fight for our place in a perpetually collapsing economy. We want to be the elite that captures the discourse, not the unemployed loser who moves back in with their parents. That's the structural part.But IdPol is also ideologically conservative, even when it starts out with good intentions. Academic intersectional feminist analysis is good and valid, but the moment an idea leaves the academic discourse it gets appropriated for other ends, and develops a life on its own, which impacts the academic discourse as well. This is how we get anti-scientific nonsense like Standpoint Epistemology. This is how we get told we are not entitled to a voice or opinion in matters, based on our immutable characteristics. This is how the focus of the debate shifted from anti-discrimination to checking your priviledge. This is how we have enabled bullies like Thought Slime, while people like Lindsey Elis have been driven off of Youtube.

4472,VaushV,"Leftist role models for disillusioned victims Seeing the recent discourse and the openness about isolation from the left with men I wanted to bring up an issue that I‚Äôve always had on my mind and repeatedly tried to bring up but faced nothing but extreme shaming and backlash.Similarly to how incels and young men may feel isolated from the left for a variety of reason, TERFs fall into this too. The left can be so vitriolic to TERFs (and I get it, they attack minorities and make life worse) that it actively drives them away when they‚Äôre genuinely trying to understand and integrate.To get personal: I was a victim of a brother who molested me as a child. From there I have had the unfortunate experience of rape which happened twice. Due to these experiences, I turned toward TERF spaces because they provided easy answers and actual sisterhood and support. When you grow up as a woman, sexual misconduct and objectification of your body is SO common. That‚Äôs an unfortunate and inseparable part of womanhood (yes, this includes trans people too!!). Men in real life were often misogynistic or would hit on me wanting sex. Women in real life all shared their stories of sexual misconduct. Those things lead me down a cynical rabbit hole. I ended up a TERF because it was the only place that felt like it ACTUALLY cared about the endemic sexual assault issue women face, being made into prey. I‚Äôve told people that many TERFs (not all, but most) are very traumatized women who have spent their lives being harassed, sexually abused, and belittled. They end up in these spaces because the general societal attitude to sexual violence victims (this also includes men btw) is to be belittled, not believed, doubted, or ignored. So many of these women feel distrust for men and those who defend them. TERF spaces prey on this trauma and weaponize it against men and trans people. The problem is that a lot of the left is unwilling to reach out to TERFs or help them. When I opened up about being a TERF and looking to understand opposition, so often I‚Äôd be met with nothing but extreme aggression and mocking. When I saw leftist spaces they were full of people making fun of TERFs and attacking them. Now that I‚Äôm not one, I understand why the left does this, but as a TERF it felt isolating and like this group was siding with abusers and unwilling to listen to women with traumatic experiences. When I saw ironic misogyny, it genuinely just reinforced what I believed about men, even leftist men. And all these experiences were echoed by other TERFs.I know my rant has gone on a long time but the guys here sharing their story of being pushed to the right and how the left not being open to helping them made me want to also point out that the left is unwilling to deradicalize TERFs or have a left-wing role model to help which has made a lot of traumatized people fall into the rabbit hole. These types of traumatized women are the result of the patriarchy in the same way incels are. But isolating and belittling doesn‚Äôt work. Wanted to point this all out and hope this sub can find sympathy because this is something I‚Äôve literally never been able to talk about with leftist.",3179,567,-0.9973,0.183,0.731,0.086

4491,VaushV,"How can we create male role models, and have equallity and parity at the same time? Hey everyone, i have recently come to a conclusion that i hope is wrong and i would like to have some input from a you. I do believe that male role models are not compatible with equality/parity. Don't kill me yet, let me explain. In light of the recent discussions about Andrew Tate that i think that we should have positive role models for young men that are not right wing grifters and fascists. I do further believe that what draws young men to these cults is the focus on dating and ""how to get that pussy"". The solutions these types of people give are obviously contradictory, wrong and harmful to society in general, but they are successful nonetheless.A pretty good generalization for dating in general is that women are the choosers and men need to make some effort in a social hierarchy. What counts as high status things in society is usually determined by a competition between men. I.e. the jobs with the highest status require intelligence, discipline and a willingness to take risk. Men are usually willing to riskier and unpleasant things, since it comes with an increase in status. However the status of a job is also pretty directly connected to the amount of women in these fields. We can see this in occupations such as nurse or teaching. Teaching is a good example, since it used to be male dominated, high status and well paid, and has since went towards being female dominated, less status and thus less paid. I believe that the causality is unfortunately ""More women -&gt; Less status for an occupation -&gt; less money"". This is obviously a problem in its own right, and needs to be adressed, but viable solutions are mostly targeting the money part of this equation, and not the status loss of these jobs. (""pay teachers more money and increase funding in education""). The status loss of these jobs is harder to address.If we take this into account, is it even possible to find male role models in education, jobs and the household, when we have parity in the sex distributions? Wouldn't an occupation that is equally filled with women and men no longer be seen as that attractive for men, because they cannot increase their social status by doing said occupation? Does that mean, that gender and sex equality is doomed to fail, because we go against human dating behaviours?  I have though about this for way to long, but i cannot find a flaw in my argumentation. There are probable cofactors for a status decrease in jobs other than ""more women in them"". I.e. less demand due to a changing environment (No one needs stablemasters anymore, since we have cars), or a circular dependency on the amount of money earned, but the number of women in these occupations seems to be a considerable and direct factor. Money could be a confounder of these two things (Jobs that pay less might not attract that many men, compared to women), but i don't think this argumentation holds. There are some high paying jobs that do not attract men, like psychotherapist, or nowadays even higher education in general. So this means that the money you get for a job does not influence the percentage of women in it as directly as it might seem. What do you all think about this argument? Is it possible to have equality and not have status loss in an occupation so that we can live happily ever after? Do Men need some domain purely for themself to have a successful dating life? If this cannot be the job market (because we are not the Taliban and want equality and women should be allowed to work), where else can men be useful and compete in male dominated spaces and find positive role models?",3687,654,0.9928,0.067,0.804,0.129

Furthermore it still adds to the pressure physically overweight people feel to appear exceptional temperate, hard working or in an eternal struggle to loose weight, signalling to people that they‚Äôre not ‚Äúone of the bad fat people.‚Äù Small dick energy functions the same way. You‚Äôre linking toxicity to the length of a guy‚Äôs dick. So while they‚Äôre dick size isn‚Äôt actually relevant, a well endowed person can still be said to display small dick energy, your still reinforcing the idea guys with small dicks will necessarily be insecure, toxic and chauvinistic. This gives guys with small dicks (or even average sized dicks) another source of insecurity. Not only are they being told by society that they may be undesirable as a consequence of something they have no control over, now they‚Äôre being told that you masculinity will never be complete or real because you don‚Äôt have the cock to match. Small dick energy is a concept that reinforces the idea that ultimately the be all and end all of a man‚Äôs worth is the size of his dick.Now, to clarify. I don‚Äôt think Greta did anything wrong in using the term. In decades past to say a guy ‚Äúthrows like a girl was considered a normal thing to say. Similarly, insulting men‚Äôs height or their dick sizes is something that at this moment society considers acceptable. I think a there‚Äôs two reasons that Greta‚Äôs use of the term got anyone‚Äôs attention at all, and both are because she‚Äôs a woman A) It‚Äôs triggering for a man to see a woman seemingly admit that dick size is something that she cares about.B) As feminism has gained more ground men are being put on blast constantly for body shaming women. It‚Äôs ceased to be acceptable to body shame women and the hypocrisy is pretty rank.I‚Äôd also like to clarify that don‚Äôt think Greta is being a hypocrite or that she believes that guys with small dicks are fundamentally bad. She used body shaming language because society gives very little push back to body shaming when it targets men. Women adopt this language from men.  We live in a patriarchal society. Men set the expectations for what men ought to be. A lot of reactionaries melted down over Greta‚Äôs use of ‚Äúsmall dick energy‚Äù but the this backlash was deeply hypocritical. Because, as is the case with the Jordan Peterson subreddit, that community has no issue with body shaming when isn‚Äôt directed at men. And also because men are the principle source body shaming for other men. If men take the view that ‚Äúsmall dick energy‚Äù is an offensive term, and want it‚Äôs use to be retired then they need to do two things:1) Educate themselves about shaming, and respect when less privileged groups have asked that offensive language be retired. 2) Ask respectfully that others, but especially other men, remove ‚Äúsmall dick energy‚Äù from their vocabulary. And finally, as leftists, if a man asks in good faith that you stop using ‚Äúsmall dick energy‚Äù or any of a host of other similar terms, then stop. It costs us nothing, we lose nothing.  I know that if it was a marginalised group asking you would. Just because men occupy a position of relative privilege does not mean they‚Äôre inherently less deserving of decency.",4019,688,-0.9984,0.191,0.725,0.084

Someone commits a petty crime and you'll get a detailed and comprehensive explanation as to why  the socio-economic conditions led that person to commit said crime, and how the system needs to focus on rehabilitation instead of punishment in order to help them for the future. This is, obviously, true, and (should) come from a place of empathy and understanding first and being a leftist second (which (should) go hand in hand, really).A man goes down the alt-right pipeline and it's entirely a choice they made and it's their fault completely, rendering them undeserving of any sympathy or compassion or effort to have prevented this happening in the first place. This is, obviously, fucking insane and is only a position someone can reach if they either have no capacity for genuine empathy or are incredibly stupid.Which leads me to believe that a worryingly large number of people only believe the first issue above because they're ostensibly leftist first and empathetic second (or not at all empathetic).",1225,202,0.7464,0.101,0.743,0.156

Yes the patriarchy negatively impacts men and it‚Äôs important we offer solutions to those problems in addition to women‚Äôs problems.But what exactly are we basing men‚Äôs loneliness on? There‚Äôs some medical journals that say ‚Äúmen aren‚Äôt working as much‚Äù or ‚Äúmen have less friends‚Äù or some vague statistic about how men are feeling isolated.First of all we‚Äôre just coming off a once in a generation global pandemic; everyone is feeling lonely. We‚Äôve had millions of Americans die, loved ones, yeah? I‚Äôd be willing to bet women are feeling pretty lousy right now too. Everybody is. Inflation is up, people are poorer now than they‚Äôve ever been. 7,000,000 able bodied men aren‚Äôt working, and we‚Äôre calling that a crisis of masculinity? Oh other countries aren‚Äôt noticing the same decline huh? Labor sectors are obviously extremely different across continents but I‚Äôd be willing to bet lots of other countries are noticing a downward trend in labor participation. It just seems silly to me‚Ä¶ where making a mountain out of a molehill saying 18-24yos don‚Äôt have friends (also subjective wtf a friend is because I know some people consider co-workers friends and I sure as fuck wouldn‚Äôt). And our only evidence is a few medical studies which basically say ‚Äúmen say they are unhappy and men say they have no friends‚Äù except the friend part seems super subjective and unhappiness is pretty fucking universal these days so causation, correlation? Whoa 7 million little worker bees aren‚Äôt working and say they‚Äôre sad and don‚Äôt find it easy engaging in meaningful relationships? After a global pandemic, death of democracy in america, sky high inflation, millions dead from sickness, no less? You don‚Äôt say.I need more proof of a crisis of men, I think a large large portion of this crisis is manufactured if not for the very least of the left trying to tap into the mra market of politics. But then again I‚Äôm the cynical type.If anybody has any studies they‚Äôd like to share that proove a crisis of masculinity is currently ongoing in America right now please post them here right and I‚Äôll gladly eat humble pie. But my hypothesis that a lot of this is overblown, exacerbated by pandemic, statistical misnomers of causation vs correlation, and not to mention a lot of the pains we think are only being felt by men SHOCKER are also being felt by women. Just weird that all of the sudden we‚Äôre so concerned for Gen Z 18-24s we‚Äôre willing to audit our entire society about it when literally it might just be growing pains. Is anybody else feeling this or am I the lone psychopath on this tangent?Seems like all the other crisis you can point at and observe (eg War in Ukraine, fight for reproductive freedom, systemic racism) all these have very concrete numbers and are well verified phenomenon but this ‚Äúcrisis of masculinity‚Äù is getting thrown around so much like it just suddenly became this universal truth and I just don‚Äôt by it. At least not with the little information we have now. Edit: sorry this is long. And sorry if it sounds like I don‚Äôt care about men‚Äôs issues I obviously do (male suicide, imprisonment, etc.). It‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt think men are in crisis.

4548,VaushV,"So wtf do yous mean by a nebulous ""left""? [How Vaush got the Tate stuff so wrong by overgeneralising] \[I would ask yourselves to be open minded when reading the critique I bring forth. Being a male feminist, who passes easy as a masculine male, who was one of the only guys in his gender sex diversity major, I feel fair qualified to engage in this debate.\]Whether from Vaush or his sycophants, it jus seems like really poor form to overgeneralise like this when discussing what is actually an important topic. Cause dunking on dumb tweets, treating them as representative of the left.... ? It seems incredibly disingenuous and insincere as a mode of inquiry.If we talking about a specifically gendered issue, how to reach and help the lost boys so they don't turn to the worst of grifters for an answer (Vaush included, lol). Then we talking specifically about feminism. Not the ""left"", and whether its ""woke"" or ""too pc"" or whatever euphemisms insecure dumb cunts use.This idea implicit in Vaush's video (no I didn't watch all 50 minutes, wasn' tryna self harm) that all leftists are anti-masculinity soy boy beta cuck blah blah blah, and that this turns men off. Is jus reifying the worst stereotypes of modern feminism (or liberalism in the US context, or lefty stuffs more generally), propagated by conservatives. Its dumb af.Whenevs these nebulous ""left"" discussions take place, its worth remembering how incredibly lopsided the media and information ecosystem is. We have old media dominated by the worst actors, new media run by the worst actors, education systems that keep most the valuable info out of hand, and a corporate media that will repackage radical ideas, defanged for the profit incentive. Liberal feminism, which comes to be the dominant representation and people's understanding of feminism, is the easiest example. The girl boss, 'if only women were allowed to win at capitalism' feminism that inhabits many an advertising campaign or hollywood film. This is the dominant representation because its profitable. But don't throw out the baby with the bath water.You can find examples of misandry in feminism sure. But reifying and validating the worst conservative takes of, not jus feminism, but the ""left"" more broadly, helps nothing here. All it does is justify men who never took the time to read feminist accounts of masculinity.These accounts are really important for two key reasons:1. They teach individuals to be conscious of gendered behaviours, to resist them where they place limitations, freeing people to live better lives in the process (this is not anti-masculinity, its being conscious of our gendered programming).2. They teach men to look to women as ideological role models (which is a really weird function of society, where the gender binary tells people to treat the other as alien and therefore not relatable or worth learning from)On 1. I shall post the great Bell Hooks quote:&gt;‚ÄúThe first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males is not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves. If an individual is not successful in emotionally crippling himself, he can count on patriarchal men to enact rituals of power that will assault his self-esteem.‚ÄùAnd&gt;"" ‚Äú**The crisis facing men is not the crisis of masculinity, it is the crisis of patriarchal masculinity**. Until we make this distinction clear, men will continue to fear that any critique of patriarchy represents a threat.‚Äù These lines of thought, which I'd kinda clued onto via others before reading Hooks, have been immensely impactful in my development as a ""man"". Feminist shit taught me I'm not ""owed"" a woman. It steered me away from the ""act hard"" egotistic nature that cripples so many males emotional maturity. Its good shit. Its also rarely promoted to young men, cause feminism typically isn't ""for them"" in its presentation. (see: for more on that).On 2. - More personally, growing up my dad was a shitcunt. All the men I knew were fucked up, and I knew it. Should I look up to them? Or the women in my life with some sort of stability? I'm glad I chose the latter. Men can learn from women. They are not alien creatures.Now think further, how many breadtubers, or public intellectuals out there that're given prominence, how many of them are women? Is the ""soyboy beta cuck left"" stereotype Vaush endorses (its kinda ironic that he's that stereotype of what he seems to be railing against) really the issue? We don't need ""real men"" for lost boys to look up to (though good lefty masculine blokes of course exist - they typically do shit in the community, fighting the fasc, organising industrial actions etc, rather than streaming all day, or making tik toks).Where Vaush, and I suspect the lostboys that follow him, do inhabit a shit side of masculinity, is in a combative style of politics. There's nothing to be gained from searching out the dumbest fucking takes on twitter to dunk on. Congrats, you dunked on a moron, arn't you a big strong man. Which is what 95% of the ""content"" is. Its so fucking insecure.There was a time in the mid 2010s when breadtube was full on inane videos where folks would rail against a nebulous ""left"" that was too up its own arse about identity politics. It didn't achieve anything. Vaush can try and revive it, I'm pleading with you all, don't. Identity politics doesn't have to exist in a promarket vacuum. Don't let the worst representations define a lot of really good shit. Actually describe what you're talking about. Stop overgeneralising. And if you want your community to do some good, stop looking for the dumbest cunts to engage with. Engage with, and frame debates in a way that's properly productive (ie, not tryna troll and shit on all the legends out there doing good).We are living in a time where some really interesting power dynamics in gender are changing. Universities are full of women, barely any men. Actually reading and getting deep into subjeccts isn' as masculine as dunking on shit tweets, I suppose.Young people as a whole are a lot more progressive. We arn't losing ""young men"" to Andrew Tate because the left is shit. Liberalism has failed. Many are turning to fascism as a result. This needs to be staunchly opposed. Validating the worst fascy critiques of the ""left"" isn' gonna help that.Tate's following might look big on a global scale, but its a really extreme pro rape position, and should be identified as such. No ones going pro rape because a ""soyboy youtuber"" was too woke, or ""antimasculinity"". Wake tf up.When it comes to young men, feeling feminised by their position in life, here are a bunch of alternatives to getting ""red pilled"" that can be offered:1. Feel the need to be combative, to pump up the ego? Punch a nazi. Fight the state. Go do some good shit. I've seen a lot of rowdy fucked up blokes better their lives by getting involved with lefty activism.2. Sad because you arn't getting laid? Try, treating women like people! Being friends with women. These can lead you to meeting other women. Some of them might want to fuck you.3. Feeling emasculated from crippling depression or anxiety? Seek help! Don't be an insecure incel about it.# Tldr, and also: Specifically to Vaush's claim -""the left doesn't give advice to men"", look at Laurie Penny's account for when she does:&gt;**Have you copped much criticism from feminists for writing about male disenfranchisement?**  &gt;  &gt;No, actually. I've caught a lot of criticism from men, some men. It's funny, the criticism I get every day on Twitter is ""Why don't you care about men? Why don't you care about male rape or suicide rates?"" And I say, ""Well, have you read my book? I really care about that. I think that's a feminist issue and I write about it all the time."" And I say, ""do you want to talk about it?"" And they just disappear.And if insecure lostboys will only listen to ""real men"" - there's SHITLOADS of that in real world lefty organising. Sorry that posting shittakes and dunking on dumb tweets all day doesn't come across as masculine to most blokes actually tryna get shit done.",8190,1389,-0.9995,0.185,0.719,0.096

The Left needs **MEN**...***a lot of men***.I just cannot imagine a revolution to overthrow the capitalist machinery without angry, able-bodied young men who are willing to use violence for their cause.It's disenchanting to see the Left develop a phobia towards aggression and violence, attributing it to ""toxic masculinity"" or ""patriarchy"". When in fact, all of the (relatively) successful revolutions in history where done with the use of violence.Young men today are very angry, because they have been (subliminally) promised by the both government and the corporate establishment that Capitalism is gonna give them happiness or some sh\*t. This pent up should be an indication that they are ready to change things...or die trying. But instead of the Left utilizing that anger to actually achieve what they are preaching, what do they do? **They mock it.** *""Ohh, it's so empowering to watch these poor men feel powerless..""* This suppression of men's anger has been extremely beneficial to the government Young men are angry but have no idea where to direct it to. We have been conditioned by this capitalist society to suppress our anger. Funny how everyone tells us to be emotionally open...***except when we're angry***, in which case we're simply advised to take a deep breath, go to therapy and take some drugs. But it makes sense though, less angry men = no disruptions of business activities. Angry men left unmedicated is **BAD** for the corporate bottomline.Men have nowhere to vent their (justifiable) anger to. So guess what, the Ben Shapiros and the Andrew Tates of the world are more than willing to absorb this abundance of attention, and redirect them away from the real culprit...**capitalism**.And practically ***NO ONE*** on the Left is competing with them!Suffice to say that the Left has given up on men, believing that we are a lost cause.But we're not. I myself am a straight man with Conservative values, who have eventually come believe in the ideals of Communism, thanks to people on the Left who didn't treat me as garbage due to my beliefs. But wait, isn't Conservative Communist an ***oxymoron***!?Not at all. Come to think of it, what do modern Conservatives **actually** believe in? Protection of the family and local community above all else. Distrust towards the government and the corporate establishment. Aren't these at least ***very close*** to what Communism preaches? And I guarantee you, that a gun-toting, Bible-thumping redneck is more likely to rebel against the government than a metropolitan, peace-loving Liberal. I mean, they literally did it on Jan 6 last year.But, doesn't being Conservative mean being racist? Or anti-feminist? Or homophobic? Absolutely not. Do not mistake a Conservative for a Republican. The problem is that the only people giving Conservatives any attention are f\*ckin' Republicans who have their own agenda.If we just actually give it a try, we can absolutely bring men to our side.",3055,492,-0.9899,0.14,0.778,0.082

4560,VaushV,"Vaush is Wrong about Men. I¬¥m not a leftist, but I¬¥m curious about certain comments that Vaush made lately on twitter, and I wonder what¬¥s the general opinion of this forum on this topic. Contemporary leftism is polemically situated against heterosexual men, which is a plausible explanation in order to understand why figures like Andrew Tate are fairly famous among young men, and this decision is not arbitrary. Vaush tends to de-personalize politics on the basis of ""structures,"" i.e., the Patriarchy exists by itself and is enforced through structures with non-conscious actors. This is a non-voluntaristic view of social relations, which is contradictory since Vaush¬¥s prescriptions are in itself voluntaristic. Vaush argues that young men are not ""Machiavellians"" that support redpill content because they want to ""dominate women,"" and the solution to this issue is to talk to them and present ""leftist"" countermodels in order to attract them to the leftist cause. In this sense, this is an issue of mere political communication and not of ""structural hierarchies.""Yet, the issue is that if you assume that the Patriarchy exists and it is a system that positions certain men over women in the social hierarchies then you need to assume that at least a portion of males are going to fight to maintain those apparent privileges, what¬¥s then the programatic goal of the Patriarchy? This is the limit of political communication and this is the declarative moment of deciding who¬¥s your enemy, the limit of enmity being the physical elimination of the Other, which in the case of feminism is impossible because it is quite absurd to murder 50% of the population.If you compare, then, the Patriarchy to Capitalism, then it would be quite absurd to assume that the bourgeoisie is going to surrender their privileges, no? And if you don¬¥t believe this, then I invite you to explain the difference between the Patriarchy and Capitalism in terms of domination (in the process undermining feminist theory). You can argue that feminism also benefits men (which is what many leftist do to make feminism more digestible to guys, I suppose), but then there is an issue, if feminism is against the domination of men over women, then what are the social benefits that I gain, as a men, with the destruction of the Patriarchy? There is this Hegelian-Marxist trick which assumes that the slave-master relation also degrades the master, but this is theoretical assumption is not useful for social analysis.Now, and excuse me if I sound sardonic, but should I give up my apparent patriarchal privileges in order to feel ""emotionally"" better? In the cost-benefit analysis, I think losing social privileges in order to have the ability to wear makeup, cry, and use skirts is ""silly,"" and based on ideological authenticity, which I don¬¥t buy.  A valid counterargument to my claims would be the question of the existence of males that are feminists. A common response to this argument would be that of stupidity, i.e., male feminists are stupid because they don¬¥t know they are going against their privileges. Yet, I don¬¥t think this is true. Male feminists exists because they gain benefits as a result of their feminism. One punctual example is that of academia, not abiding by the daily doses of administrated feminism might imply losing the opportunity to fight for a certain professional position, or if you are a professor, being an anti-feminist might invite for constant fights and struggles between the professor and the student body (who are ultimately the consumers of education). In this sense, being a male feminist might be a safe bet in the perseverance of your academic existence. In this sense it might be a viable tool to make leftists (and feminism) the dominant ideology in society in order to force males into being feminists, but this is merely a totalitarian fantasy, a pragmatically impossible goal. Additionally, feminism (or leftism) are not monoliths and they¬¥re in constant state of evolution (the feminist of today might not be the feminists of tomorrow, and so on). Essentially, Vaush¬¥s struggle to convince men like me that his version of leftism/feminism is good for me is not a mere question of political communication but a struggle for forcing ""progressives values"" into all spheres of society, forcing me in the process to abide by the rules of the game of that punctual sphere, and his non-voluntaristic voluntaristic social analysis ignores that there are social relations of domination that set, in a sense, the political struggles in question.",4565,748,-0.9121,0.123,0.767,0.11

4565,VaushV,"Why the Taliban would brutally crush antifa-if antifa tried to fight them. So there are rumors that antifa may attempt to fight the Taliban just like they do with ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Here's why it will end horribly for them.1. **The Taliban don't mess around:** If there was a pro-Taliban rally in Kabul, and antifa tried holding a counterprotest using ""black bloc"" tactics, and of course punching the Taliban. The Taliban and it's civilian supporters would be quick to react. Unlike the alt right, who are unusually tolerate of physical violence against them, despite being the ""most dangerous extremist threat"", the Taliban wouldn't hesitate to retaliate against any antifa guy that thinks ""punching mujahideen"" is a good idea. Most likely the antifa guy or gal, would get shot, blown (by IED), or beaten to death by the Taliban or it's supporters. Their black clad clothing would antifa too easy to target and spot. On top of that, any civilian shooting a antifa member assaulting them would be ruled self defense. To be fair, I don't how self defense works in Afghanistan, but generally shooting a person for physically assault can be ruled as self defense. In this case, the regime would be proud to do so, if the armed civilian is pro-Taliban.2. **History:** The Taliban have fought and defeated antifa before, when the Soviet Union-which I know many on the left consider them to be antifa-invaded the Afghanistan and murdered thousands in the name of ""anti-fascism"" and ""progress"", only to get their asses kicked by the based goat herders and predecessors of the Taliban, the Afghan mujahideen. Given antifa loves to display the ""hammer and sickle"" symbol at their protests, the Afghans would be quick to turn hostile on them. To the Taliban, and the broader mujahideen, it will be like the good ol days of the 80s, minus the Hind attack helicopters. I'm sure a lot of them would get nostalgia from killing commies again. The Soviet Afghan war is the reason, why many antifa are scared of setting foot in Afghanistan-and should be.3. **Opinion:** The Taliban would without a doubt dub antifa as anti-Islamic, outlaw them completely-if they haven't done it already. Given the history of far left oppression in Afghanistan, the people would view antifa or any far left group as ""extremist terrorist"" seeking to overthrow the Taliban and reestablish the democratic republic of Afghanistan. The rest of the world would probably view retaliatory violence against Afghan antifa, as defensive/justified.IMO, it's a really bad idea for antifa to go to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban, unless if you want to get slaughter and make the mujahideen nostalgic. Punch a Taliban, sounds more like suicide. The Left-far left especially-sucks at counterinsurgency and loses to guerrilla fighters at least 95%. In this case, antifa would be fighting a unwinnable war against irregular and regular army.",2896,478,-0.9969,0.184,0.734,0.082

Sure, that falls within the scope of leftism, duh. But when it comes to shit like dating or life advice? The idea that we need to shout at leftists to bootstrap some People's Dating Advice Commune is fucking wack. Libs and apolitical people exist. There's shitloads of content out there devoted to dating advice, making friends, getting jobs that is either openly liberal or just doesn't do the standard MRA shit. Sure, libs have bad politics. But they're still people with life experience who can impart it into others. And I don't care if they're cringe. If you want to go out on dates you're gonna have to get used to the possibility that the girls you're attracted to might be a little cringe. It's a fact of life. The entire reason why people like Jordo and Andrew Tate exist is because dummies refuse to take the exact same (if less toxic) advice from more normal people for purely aesthetic reasons. Be better than that.Ultimately these things are personal issues and if there's one thing that lies well outside the scope of economic populist leftism, it's the personal issues of how you live your life. The entire lynchpin of your life does not need to be leftism, you can take advice from centre-ward sources without being magically turned to a centrist like they're vampires. It's okay. And in fact refusing to do this will turn you into a worse leftist because you can't interact with ideas that don't have solid grounding in Marxist theory.Obviously Sturgeons law is a thing and much of the content out there is going to be less than useful. But it's a better option for waiting for leftist dating advice channels to pop up out of the aether.

I don't usually make posts on reddit. But I feel like this has to be said. I was picked up by the right during the height of gamergate. In the beginning, it was just to laugh at the cringe because people making an unhinged ass of themselves will never get old. I did however feel there must be some legit grievance the left and feminists must have. So, occasionally, I tried to find some understanding. Unfortunately, I always seemed to pick the worst people to reply to and ask. Granted, I wasn't very tactful in my approach (because duh, I didn't know jack shit) but I WAS genuinely trying to learn. The misandry, anti-white racism, and accusing me of ""Mansplaining"" whenever I tried inputting what I saw was too much. I concluded the left to be utterly insane and unable to have a nuanced discussion.Was it any wonder that compared to the people I came across on the ""left"", the right *seemed* sane? I was able to talk with them and have calm and semi-rational responses. Obviously, we all know it was all part of the schtick to lure me in further and when armed with better information their arguments fall apart. None the less, it was effective, and **STILL** is to those who find themselves where I once was. I wasn't on the right because of some ingrained malice, but because I was misinformed and mislead by the right while being ostracized by the left. There are absolutely PLENTY of irredeemable sexist racist shitheads who have no hope of being better. That's still no reason to abandon those who just need someone to reach out to them in understanding and help them grow. It's disgusting to see the left I saw back then still alive and well after all these years.

4586,VaushV,"On the topic of how progressives neglect male issues Note: My reactionary phase was between 2006-2010, but a lot of things were pretty much the same, except we had earlier versions of the same controversies (like The Lion King ""SFX"" controversy instead of Balenciaga). I tried to warn others an impeding reactionary movement the moment someone takes a look at what happened in Hungary, but almost nobody listened to me.Firstly, I personally didn't even wanted to uphold my own ""privileges"" (which I only had a few of only in certain situations, see later), I wanted to do away with the whole system. However, people told me there's this evil thing called ""feminism"", and they're the reason why I have the issues I had, but the best they could get out of me is to hate feminism for supposed man hating and not caring about real issues like the very low age of consent of Hungary, for which I was called a ""jealous"" person by women I assumed to be feminist for no other reason than they hated me. I still wanted to do away with the system instead of getting a ""tradwife"" that will cook for me and stuff.Other thing progressives forget are conservative women. They're the *real* golddiggers the reactionaries warned you about. If you're poor, disabled, and maybe even not working a manly manual labor, then you're not a man for them. They think under patriarchy and an ideal man, all they have to do is to give birth to children and cook. Of course they usually get more grounded, since only a fraction of men would have the money to sustain a whole big family from a single income (and sometimes they're programmers, which isn't a manly manual labor), but otherwise they're more vile to you, and since you associate feminism with men hating, you'll see them as feminists regardless of how do they actually feel. If you're in the suburbs or a small town, it'll affect you even more.There's also the issue of privileges working in context. While as a white guy, I usually had more privilege in life, but as I'm autistic, I've often been treated as a lesser. This also made a lot of advices not working out for me: I'm very quiet thanks to bullying, I have certain repetitive behaviors that are in ""how to tell if someone's lying"" guides, best I can do as masking is to hold back my hand flapping and certain stims, etc.While progressives sometimes have better advices, they're often worded in a very condescending way (especially about hygiene), and I get a lot more shallow advice on ""confidence"", which is not a thing I can easily give off, or fake (as thoughtslime suggested many times). I live in a small town, and ""leaving the house"" doesn't work at all for me, then I cannot talk to strangers at all at big events like concerts etc. I also can't tolerate alcohol or drunk people, thanks to my alcoholic grandmother. While douches like Tate or Peterson don't give good advices, they at least tell you how to be a ""confident man"", rather than talking about it in a very abstract way.",2983,531,-0.9191,0.134,0.753,0.114

4602,VaushV,"Is toxic feminity real? Who, when, and how should it be discussed? In light of the discourse on men's issues and why people like Tate keep being signal boosted, a topic I've been wanting to discuss with this community is the existence and manifestation of toxic feminity. As a black dude, intersectionality has given me a lot of insight into behaviors of differing groups I used to be perplexed by. For example, I used to be (somewhat still am) puzzled by how defensive white people would act in response to claims of historical and economic privileges. Or, the backlash to the conjured image of CRT labeling white people as holistically evil and racist. While it's important to note that, especially in CRT's case, often there is misinformation and willful ignorance at play, some of the knee jerk denial and deflection can be in part explained by a need to preserve one's own morall image of themselves. And this is *bound* to happen due to the inherent nature of language and how marginalized communities express grievance and catharsis.A staple of black comedy and commentary is complaining about stupid racist stuff white people (and other communities) do as a result of anti blackness and white supremacy. When venting this frustration, often marginalized people use generalized and even reductive language such as ""white people be crazy"" or ""the caucasity"". Of course, while comedic, there is an essentialization that could be interpreted from these comments that understandably draws a knee-jerk reaction from white people where they say, "" thats not me!?"" It could be them or not, but the nature of language, especially outside of academic settings, invites generalizations especially of those who seem to be in the privileged caste. I think this directly ties into the broader discussion on Twitter because I think a lot of men (including myself at one time) were/are unreceptive to feminism due to the perception of impugning their character without knowing them personally. While the twitter discourse clearly shows that a strain of flat-out misandry is alive and well within some circles of progressives/left, the charitable well adjusted mature take imo is that women simply vent the same way black people vent about white supremacy. Ultimately, just like white supremacy has to be enforced by people, particularly white people, so too does Patriarchy have to be in large part perpetuated by men so this is reflected in the way they complain about men and toxic masculinity. Apologies for that long preamble, but I want to make an important distinction that's missed in this discussion, especially in this sub. Race is *NOT* the same as gender or sex. The stereotypes and essentialization of race have been rightfully condemned as immoral and unproductive in  predicting outcomes and establishing codes of conduct. However, I don't think the same can be said of sex. The fact that men predominately make up the vast majority of sexual violence and physical violence towards women is an incredibly important insight into the way women are taught (and of course through their own agency) view men. 13/50 is a terrible way of justifying fear of black people but its just common knowledge that men can and (often? Idk if its serial offenders or a lot of men) sexually assault and harm women therefore it's understandable why a woman will lock her doors or switch to the other side of the street as I walk by. That's a double standard that's heavily reinforced even or *especially* by the left. And quite frankly, as my empathy for women grew, that *""burden""*  (if I could be a little melodramatic) as a man is something I learned to swallow and accept as an unfortunate reality both sexes have to navigate. That being said, you don't have to go full JP or Tate to acknowledge that there is an imbalance in both comedy and serious critique on regards to gender/sex. As said earlier intersectionality has given me a lot of insight, and its pretty obvious that marginalized communities hate being critized, especially if the identity of the person making the critique isn't apart of said community. This is understandable for the obvious reason that marginalized communities in particular women have experienced thousands of years of Patriarchy and its misogynistic outcomes. However, I don't think that is a reason to discourage any discussion both and comedic serious about bad behaviors of both genders. Which finally leads to the actual point of the post. Criticizing toxic masculinity is heavily established in leftist/progressive circles for good reason. However, if half the population is women, should some analysis of toxic feminity be available assuming it exists? What are the characteristics of it and how does it harm men and women? If at all, how would women like it to be discussed? I ask all of these in good faith because while I most definitely don't blame women or even the ""left"" necessarily for Tater tot's and his ilk's rise, I do think they base a large portion of their circus act on balancing on a slim pole of valid criticisms and frustration men may have towards women that they abuse to seek in the misogyny.",5143,860,-0.9891,0.124,0.784,0.092

4616,VaushV,"on claims that teen girls can't be radicalized Rant incoming: Last night I saw a now deleted tweet claiming that teen girls are disaffected but don't get radicalized like men do and it made me want to scream, because looking back at how I was as a teenage girl I was always close to that line and the few things that kept me from crossing it were basically due to sheer chance. I was a self described libertarian and a 9/11 truther in middle school and by high school a regular 4chan user and super steeped in pop spirituality, the kind that qanon hippies like now. I was alienated and anxious and had no social skills which led me towards hard-core skepticism and hatred of authority, and the only reason it didn't result in me getting dragged into the conspiracy wing of the right was because I happened to be a fan of a handful of anarchist punk bands, meaning all that skepticism and rage got directed at cops which basically caused me to permanently drop anchor on the left. I don't know how many of these people making such claims are separated from their teen years. I experienced all this in the late 00s early 2010s and admittedly the internet was a pretty different place, but I think the core problems are the same. I think a lot of people who were on the brink of falling down a right wing pit can attribute them not falling in to a handful of things that were kinda up to chance. I'm really tired of seeing the narrative that it is always some conscious decision to become a right winger, and I'm damn exhausted by the narrative that boys are hard wired to make those choices and girls are somehow absolved.",1620,300,-0.9782,0.173,0.732,0.095

I've always admired Vaush for sticking to data over intuition but this principle seems to go out the window when he talks about homeschooling.

Some studies say there's no difference in sociability. So what makes him say otherwise? In my own personal experience, being pushed into an environment that I didn't want to go to, and factors like getting bullied by my peers and still being forced to go there everyday seemed to kill whatever passion for socializing I had, and I'm guessing this is the case for a lot of people. Homeschoolers on the other hand have a bigger choice in the kind of social situations they want to be in, and can opt out of one which isn't to their liking.

4636,VaushV,"possible debate-partner about Feminism and masculinity In the last self-help advice/masculinity episode of the Vaush-is-always-right-series on Youtube he expressed the desire for a debate on this topic.   I recently stumbled upon this channel ( which is the nearest to a ""leftist MRA"" i¬¥ve seen so far.   The content is a bit redundant because it¬¥ mostly the same ten arguments and a lot of ""call-out-videos"" against bad feminist advocates. But she also calls out sexism in her community and has a stance against incel-ideology. What bothers me the most with the content is the rejection of feminism (at least the 3rd wave) allthough she clearly states equality of genders as her goal and i think she would be fine with gender-abolitionism. She is, as far as i¬¥ve seen, a LGBTQ-ally and often proclaims that the real issue lies in hierarchical powerstructures.( --&gt;she has an Anarchy tattoo on her belly)I think this could still be worth a debate and not a friendly convo, because of her Anti-feminist stance. Maybe Vaush could strong-man Feminism. :-)  Also it might be worth doing research at some of her arguments beforehand. (She cites sauces but sometimes they are a bit sus or the argument isn¬¥ that easy to connect to the study at hand.

4638,VaushV,"an perspective from an former red pill guy I like that Vaush likes to point out that male loneliness is a problem, and I'm not surprised the majority of ppl who are critical of him, are ultra-feminsts. What I've learned from being a red pill guy, is that females like certain types of toxic men because they are exciting. Bad boys or fuckboys, in other words. And no, it's not like I didn't try to talk with females. I did it countless times with my buddies. I started to see a pattern the more girls I talked too. They didn't generally like the old nice conversation I had with them. They kinda wanted me to be bad like my friends in an edgy way. I didn't because I didn't want to contribute to the toxic masculinity that was rapid in our society. I came to the conclusion that females  men alike are drawn to toxicity because that is what triggers them sexually. I never tried to be a douchebag in order to get laid, because that goes against my principles. This leads me to believe that a vast majority of men specifically suffer from mental illness of some kind, be it mild or bad. My best buddy who was sorta a player, was on anti-depressive meds. This is what generally led me down the alt-right pipeline a few years ago, since the left was basically non-existing on the dating advice front. The red pill teaches men to be toxic in order to get laid, but that further reinforces the toxic masculinity. What angers me is how the feminists don't see the problem here.

We aren‚Äôt meeting their needs of how they want to consume content or what motivates them to disregard future content by future creators.Some takeaways - assume teens are already watching popular right leaning video.- target topics that are relevant to teens (status, power, being good with girls and friends etc)- make the other content creators look cringe AF, embarrassment or uncertainty is likely to be the key to influence this cohort. - keep the takedowns short, and focus on the viewer and an alternate view they should adopt.- the goal should be to breakthrough enough to make impressionable viewers wary of certain creators on face value.That is all, in short I think other hobbies have this figured out we just need to work on our presentation.Go with christ",1861,313,0.9561,0.048,0.842,0.11

Consider this the /r/VaushV dating advice thread.

Make sure to hold frame, maintain eye contact for X seconds to establish a mental connection, yadda yadda. Yes it‚Äôs cringe, yes most of it is probably bogus, but the *one* crucial thing it‚Äôs effective in is giving men a regimented approach to actually start getting out there and interacting with women.

4657,VaushV,"Men's Issues: Either we have a response or we don't. Holy shit, the dialogue surrounding this is fucking insane. Let's break down the two most common reponses to Vaush's suggestion of making active attempts to ensure young men end up being decent. I'm not going to be able to cover all the aspects of this, and there's going to be some conceptual overlap.1. ""Men are evil."" So quite a few folks seem to be responding to Vaush by saying something akin to ""Men go far right because they're evil and the patriarchy benefits them"". First of all, to the degree that men believe that, they're *wrong*. We need to emphasize that patriarchy is bad for men, first of all because it's *true*, and truth matters, but also because, ""Stop doing things that are good for you"" is pretty weak fucking argumentative position. So many goddamn lefties cede this fucking ground for NO GODDAMN REASON. Obviously the takedown of patriarchy will, in certain select ways, entail that certain benefits are withdrawn from men, but the tradeoffs are objectively worth it. I have happy news: we are not in a position were we have to ask men to be ascetic heroes who sacrifice the bulk of their happiness for the betterment of the world. We have a much easier sell. Also, it's more complicated than that. There's never ONE reason anything happens. A person cancels plans with their friends to stay home, the wind blows through an open window to knock over a candle which catches their bed on fire, the fire spreads, the fire truck breaks down on the way to the scene, and the person dies. What's the cause of their dying? The canceled plans? The truck breaking down? The physics of the universe allowing for combustion? Everything that happens is due to a huge network of stuff. Men go far right because of an enormously complicated network of factors with a lot of variation across time and place and from person to person. Which brings me to:To some degree men might go far right because they selfishly believe the patriarchy benefits them, but that's a piece of the puzzle. Layered on top of that is a ton other bullshit: uncertainty aboir how to be masculine, a lack of role models, the atomization of society, shame, capitalism, a million other things I've forgotten about. Also, let's not forget: they are being actively recruited my people like Tate who use deliberate measures to target young men. So many fucking people seem to be acting like dudes going dark side is just some spontaneous generation thing, like it just happens because it happens. Motherfucker, people are MAKING it happen. Jesus. So the question is: which factor(s) do we address in particular to prevent a phenomenon? Like, with the above fire example, we could implement changes to check up on fire truck engines more often, or we could do PSAs about the danger of candles, or we can pass laws to make bed sheets more fire resistant, or a number of other things. Each of those will have their own rates of success and tradeoffs. So with respect to the issue of men going far right, the question is: out of the innumerable factors that contribute to men going dark side, which ones are the most important to address and how are we going to do it? Giving men life advice from a leftist informed perspective seems like a decent avenue. Maybe not the only one, but that seems like it could be valuable. Young dudes need to see some kind of life to aspire to, some kind of signpost, not as a guru or infallible leader, but *something.*And...what else are we going to do? Like if men are just Bad TM and there's nothing to do about it then we're straight fucked. You, me, all of us: if all the men being drawn to the far right are INEVITABLY going to go down that path then we should give up. Go home, wait for the end, the planet is doomed. As for me, because I know we're not doomed, I'd like to take steps to prevent doom. 2. ""Not my responsibility."" Ok, ""responsibility"" as an idea is used in different ways. Do responsibilities need assigned? I guess we have a vague idea of ""socially agreed upon behavior""? At any rate, if we do nothing, we're fucked. Do you care about people? Do you care about yourself? Well, helping prevent men from going far right, and drawing them out it, helps you and others. Easy trolley problem: you pull lever and save everyone. Please don't be the person who lets everyone on the track die (including yourself) just because you didn't start the train and don't think it's your responsibility. Don't be the person who let the world burn because it wasn't your job. 3. ""You're blaming women for their abuse""..............................no? Vaush was talking to the left *as* the left. All of it: men, women, enbies, etc. Imagine if I said ""driving instructors should emphasize the dangers of drunk driving"" and then you point to a driving instructor who died because of a drunk driver and then you accuse me of blaming the instructor for not doing a good job. What? A lot of this is people conflate the idea of ""blame"" with the idea of ""could have done something to make the bad thing not happen.""4. ""You want to coddle misogynists"". Look, there's heights and depths to this shit, and not everyone goes dark side because of a lack of compassion, but that is a thing that, to various degrees, can happen in the real world. It's a real thing that has happened, and I have no idea how often, where men feel heard and listened to about their pain by people on the right more than the left, and then they're drawn to the right. Do I think we could have hugged Hitler into being decent? No, probably not. But not everyone is a hitler. Also, do we believe in restorative fucking justice or not? Isn't the essence of that a combination of two basic factors ""we will not accept your harmful behavior"" and ""you are still a human with dignity and we care about you and want you to be better and will help you do be better""? --------For real tho, some people could be in the line at the gas chamber and they'd be holding their head high, warmed by the thought that they're such a good and pure lefty.

Pretty soon other kids figured out they could get away with breaking the rules by simply blaming me. And it worked. I was always getting in trouble for things I didn‚Äôt do.Back then it was very common to harass women. So when me and my friends harassed a girl I would try the same trick. Tell on them before they told on me and see if I could trick the sentient lugnut boomers to blame the victim. It didn‚Äôt work, so my natural conclusion was that society simply had a bias that favored women in man on women disputes.As I grew older, I learned to treat people equally. Including women. I believed men and nerds were a disadvantaged group but I sure as shit wasn‚Äôt going to be a victim. I was a bully with a superiority complex because I saw myself as smarter than everyone who made my life hell growing up. If I was going to get in trouble for shit I didn‚Äôt do, I was going to do shit.I still bullied women, but no more so than any man. I made sexist jokes, but I also made fun of people‚Äôs weight, height, speaking abilities fashion sense and so on. I used anything I thought would maximize butthurt.I grew up on anonymous message boards, bullying users, fucking with mods and simply being an absolute dipshit the nanosecond I could become anonymous.Naturally I found an interest in anonomizig tactics which lead to an interest in hacker culture and cybersecurity. The one thing you learn very quickly as a hacker is that most people are VERY stupid and easy to manipulate on the internet. Way more so than real life. I had power I never had in real life. The image of a hacker being some high IQ genius who can outsmart the best and brightest engineers and IT people is a myth. Nothing could be further from the truth. It‚Äôs mostly about taking advantage of people‚Äôs stupidity and technological illiteracy. It was about finding things that were not configured properly. Pentesting tools keeped improving and the practice keeps getting easier and more accessible. But in the words of Ron White ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt fix stupid.‚ÄùI found my neich of like minded nerds. Almost all of them were men. like any ostensibly stereotypical nerd, we had a shared interest in hard sciences, computers and video games. These were the kids who were always getting good grades, joined debate teams, chess clubs, book clubs and things we ostensibly considered intellectual subjects. But don‚Äôt let them fool you. Make no mistake. The jocks wern‚Äôt the bullies, we were. We were just the ones who ended up being the victors who got to write history. We made chad look like the villain for stealing the girl we couldn‚Äôt get because we were too self absorbed and socially inept.",4229,758,-0.9886,0.178,0.679,0.143

4685,VaushV,"Attempt at Angry Leftist to Angry Leftist Translation. So, many people disagree with the recent tweet (on supporting teenagers and young men so they don't follow a ""self-help -&gt; anti-feminism"" path of decline).Some of those disagreements are daft, and I like a lot of other people here have commented about that recently, I won't go over it again here.But don't take every criticism of Vaush's recent tweets as being fundamentally against the idea of helping young men.For example, Vaush brought up this tweet, and was like ""I don't get it, why does he disagree?"".Firstly, obviously, it's twitter, everyone is ripping into that set of tweets for mutually exclusive reasons, because other people are, and it's the trend at the moment to do that, so people who could say something another way are saying it through attacking the tweet if it halfway fits.But also, how is this disagreement?It's really simple.Too many people, including Vaush, are assuming that he's disagreeing on the normative claim:""It is important that we actively provide alternative models of masculinity for young men, so they, among other things, don't grow up into idiots""But he's actually responding to the reproving/factual claim tied along with it:*""And you haven't already been doing that""*You know if you're in a long term relationship with someone, and they ask you to do something you've just done, you can feel a tinge of irritation?It doesn't come from the assertion that something should be done, you agree with them that it should be done, rather, it comes from the implicit assumption that they *needed* to tell you, that you didn't already know, and that you didn't already do it.This is a stupid conversation pattern in a relationship, and one worth staving off for as long as you can, for general happiness, but I believe this tweet is an obvious example of this pattern happening between leftists, and something that has been going for more than just this person in a more veiled way.-So about that tweet, has anyone on this sub seen that guy's video? Is it lost somewhere in youtube's algorithm? Probably the latter. (And I like Kendrick Lamar, so I'd personally be interested in that if I knew it existed)Well, now, by inserting it into this discourse, it has been promoted. Drama sells.But also...Conservative people buy ads all the time, they start multi-level-marketing companies to promote themselves, they get free press from liberal TV from outrage or because they whine about ""the media"" not covering something, while it gets directly pushed to fox news etc.If you or I think the left isn't doing something, there's actually a good chance that someone somewhere *is* in some forgotten corner of the internet, and we just haven't been able to *find it*.There are probably already people on the left out there doing that, and we just don't know about it.It's always hard to prove a negative, and although this tweet managed to pull enough controversy to actually get to this guy, which in a perverse internet way is in some ways good..It's stupid that this guy promoted his video by talking about it in an antagonistic way, and that's how I heard about it, but we should actually be finding ways to cross promote videos and perspectives that actually do help.The normative call for more efforts to produce content that young men, and particularly, teenagers, recognise as valuable, that's something that we should ideally express in a ""more of this please"", not a *""the left has failed""* form.Why?Because it avoids pissing off those people already going unrecognised for their efforts to do exactly that.Instead, we can say it in slightly different ways, like saying we need to find, promote, and learn from the people already doing that etc.-And just like with the version of this exchange in relationships, an adjustment on both sides smooths over the potential arguments; just like it's not someone's fault if they're doing something and it's not being promoted, it's also not your fault that you didn't know, and only saw bad advice in its place.-But big picture **TLDR**, don't get all doomer about how no-one on the left cares about men, it's true that some people are angry about the tweet because they don't care, but some are angry because they *do* and don't think they're getting enough credit for how hard it is to actually follow through on that.",4357,728,0.9478,0.09,0.797,0.113

Just so hard to stay hopeful when I'm seeing so many bread tubers just talk like men deserve exile cause they are inevitably gonna be nazis and abusive. Way back in my teens, when I identified as a man, a lot of my friends and people around me treated me this way and I definitely made a lot of my own mistakes that I own, but it sure made me feel so hopeless and bitter to feel like so many people just expected me to constantly fail. It was gross to be told that I had naturally abusive instincts. It felt so backwards to feminism and progressive thinking in general. And then when I transitioned that messaging ended immediately. But at that point it became an internalized transphobic idea that took years to shake cause that same messaging about cis men was used by the right to talk about why trans women are predators. If I hadn't had the priveledge of finding people who gave me more of a fair judgement in my teen years, I would've kept finding comfort in pick up artist content and then been drawn in by Jordan Peterson types.It feels like there's this genetic component to men acting like monsters. And if that's how they feel I don't know how we move forward. I worry its gonna just get worse till they start walking back on trans people and say that being born male is some kind of original sin trans people have to atone for like cis men.

4709,VaushV,"POC Masculinity I really appreciate that vaush has been giving new ones and advice for men and their masculinity but I feel like  He can go more in depth to different race masculinities because the intersectionality of the subject.  Maybe watching some videos by FD signifier on Black Masculinity or  videos on Asian masculinity on stream. I feel this will help like the rest of the community especially the Black, Asian and  Latino and all those of color. Because wash advice is helpful to a limit because he needs to also remember that a lot of us also are limited by our race when it comes to these  interactions also our environment where we live but I can go for anybody.  However unfortunately in this world our race does play a lot into how much people  we'll interact with you.  Like for example How the left tells men don't have to be aggressive or Physically imposing. But forget that some men particularly black men or boys are in dangerous areas where if they're not able to be somewhat physically opposing they can get heavily bullied or even worse ganged up upon. I feel like it would be good if he were to go over the  segments or take a few videos about this may be on the vaush pit or the main channel.  Also I hope one day like vosh and allow the men on the left can come together to give advice to young boys and men especially to get them away from the grifting path. I also want to say that people don't think a lot of these right wing talking points can affect  Boys of color. If my own personal experience I can tell you yes it does especially when a lot of things that are hyperfixed later on our masculinity is something that sometimes they don't have. For example if you're Latino or Black you may not be the most financially well off so these things About paying for the 1st date can be a lot more difficult for them.

4715,VaushV,"A Brief Comparison between Noncompete and Twitter Radfem Brainrot. I want to be Absolutely Clear hereI AM NOT comparing the modern white men to jews.I AM comparing the cognitive processes behind Antisemitism to Misandrists on twitterI am not an essayist much of this is a stream of consciousness, I would like feedback on these thoughts.The recent twitter discourse has reminded me about the Vaush v Noncompete debate.  To recap the debate was mostly confusing but nearing its conclusion they start talking about the reason why what the Nazis did was wrong.  Noncompete argued that ""The Holocaust was bad Because they were wrong about jews controlling banks"".  Vaush's argument was that ""Even if the banks were controlled by Jews, it wouldn't justify the Holocaust.""  Vaush made this argument by factually pointing out that there was a disproportionate amount of jews working in banks in Germany, which made Noncompete angry and leave.  Vaush then proceeded the debate by saying that Noncompete's logic is one that would allow for something like the Holocaust to happen. Before I discovered Vaush, I believed that an essential axiom to being an antifascist is ""A disproportionate amount of people from of group, defined by it's immutable traits, at the top of a hierarchy, does not justify the mistreatment of other members of that group.""  And it is this Axiom that made me believe that Vaush was good when I did discover him.  I had also believed that it was a common Axiom among the left, and was quite disappointed to find it wasn't.I believe that a lot of the Radfems on Twitter have similar cognitive processes that Noncompete demonstrated in the debate.  A number of ""bad lefties"" perform politics from an area of impotent spite, that is they see the people who are actually responsible but because they cannot do anything directly to those people.  Unlike Antisemites, they often do notice legitimate problems with society and can even come to decent solutions, however they often remain focused on ""Who is at fault"" and the rage builds up inside of them to the point where they outlash against groups of people instead of systems or the individuals at the top of those systems.  One of the ways that social groups aquire more members is by justifying the anger of individuals.  It's a cult tactic, and I am saying that many leftist spaces online are cult like in nature.  We've seen this in the Alt-right Pipeline, and I also believe that it is a part of the Twitter lefty Pipeline.",2491,421,-0.9905,0.136,0.796,0.068

4718,VaushV,"I'm getting 2014 flashbacks Did anyone see the movie ""The Red Pill?"" It was a documentary made by this lady, Cassie Jaye. She had tried to become an actress in Hollywood but got discouraged by only being offered roles to play girlfriends or victims or background characters. Instead she decided to make documentaries and one day set out to make a movie about the Men's Rights movement fully expecting to expose them as misogynists, but as she interviewed various MRA leaders she found herself finding their critiques and issues very reasonable; nothing at all like she expected and nothing like the way mainstream feminist sources talked about them.  Make no mistake. Today I recognize Cassie Jaye as a grifter (or at least very naive). Her film bends over backwards to smooth over a lot of really shitty dudes views and leave out lots of relevant context surrounding certain statistics. The Men's Rights organizations she looks at usually have reasonable issues to discuss on the surface, but once you talk to them for more than 5 minutes things boil down to ""Yea, and it's FEMINISM'S FAULT that male suicide rates are so high!"" and bristling at the concept of toxic masculinity. They're recognizing real problems, but their value ends right there.  But at the time (especially if you saw the movie and took everything at face value) when I and a lot of other people saw was a single feminist taking the time to actually listen to men and finding that they have problems that society isn't addressing. The anti-SJW/Gamergate crowd absolutely loved this movie because it confirmed what they'd been saying for a while; that they have reasonable problems but no one wants to listen to them because hyper-sensitive feminists have trained society to think ""man=bad"" etc. ""We're the ones with facts and logic on our side and everyone else is just being overly emotional"" was the prevailing thought process.  \-------------------------------  The problem with the Men's Rights discourse from that time period was that the MRAs doing it were mostly just whiners who wanted to blame their problems on feminism instead of traditional gender roles (ironically because they had irrationally emotional responses to the word ""patriarchy"" rather than learning what it actually meant).  Vaush isn't doing this. He's correctly identifying the way we gender men and boys as a society as the root of the issue, and correctly saying that addressing this issue is something all of us should do.  However ...   I can understand why some people are reacting the way they are to this current discourse. It reminds them of the same old talking points from pre-2016 Youtube. They remember the whole ""Why won't anyone listen to the poor men?"" messaging with coded misogyny and contempt for progressives and identity politics simmering just below the surface.",2832,468,-0.9958,0.146,0.818,0.035

4729,VaushV,"Lots of popular discussion currently about Incels is coming from people without experience of being in those groups Speaking as someone who got sucked into the alt-right pipeline and is now a leftist...I was just thinking while reading some discourse is that a lot of women/people who haven't fallen down the alt-right rabbit hole just simply don't understand it. They get the basis of *how* the misogyny spreads, but not *why* it's spreading. To quote the discourse I linked to;&gt;to say that alt-right figures show more ""compassion"" to young men than leftists is...a take. have you not seen videos with PUA telling young men that they're pathetic and useless? or incel forums telling them they're unloveable?This fundamentally misses how relationship dynamics function in incel circles. Yes, there is a lot of negativity in these circles, but for the most part, very few other than super blackpilled people think that the people in these circles are totally irredeemable. Every insult and put-down is bookended by ""You can do better, get your shit together"". There's a certain emotional appeal to having guys in similar situations as you recognize that it's a shitty point to be at in life, but if you throw yourself into self-improvement then you can fix your life. That's why fitness, alternative health, and other communities built around self-help can be susceptible to these things - sad lonely guys looking to improve their lives get legitimate good advice and external motivation, but the misogynist stuff gets added to it so it's easier to ""redpill"" people.&gt;why are you tying yourself in knots to avoid the major issue of patriarchy? some young men wouldn't even listen to women even if they were compassionate towards them, because they're going to right-wing creators to confirm their biases anywayBack in GamerGate era, alt-right pipeline types had mastered their craft. Cringe/fail compilations were already a really popular trend, and objectively, a lot of feminists who were in these compilations had legitimately crazy outbursts and poorly represented whatever points about patriarchy they were trying to explain. While right-wingers were happy to break down the cringe hysterics and lure people in, there wasn't the same calcuated deprogramming happening from the Left - it was much of the same we see today of ""You are irredeemable and horrible if you follow these misogynists"", with zero empathetic outreach to explain why right-wing interpretations were faulty. There were no large or widespread Leftist content creators, and many who could have effectively debunked these ideas such as Innuendo Studios were just getting started post-GamerGate, and many more not really rising to prominence until the last 6 years or so. So I don't think it's necessarily about not wanting to listen to compassionate women - it's moreso about having trusted right-wing sources to get info from. Particularly in the context of the rise of the online Sceptic movement - many people such as myself started getting into GamerGate because the people covering it fron a right-wing perspective had initially gotten viewers through early Atheist content. You had a marginalized and disaffected group of primarily men who were being fed GamerGate info from the lens of ""This content is all about rational, objective analysis. I trust this source because they're logical, critical thinkers who are addressing faults in religious thinking, and many of these crazy feminists are being presented like crazy theologists"".I think that current feminists and antifascists would do a lot better if they extended some empathy to the incel group. I'm sure it feels counterintuitive to them, but it's wild seeing so many factually incorrect assumptions about how incel communities operate and draw people in. I think Brianna Wu is one of the only cis women I've seen who has an idea of this, but I think that's likely because she was one of the people initially thrust into this.Thoughts/opinions appreciated!",3997,640,0.9502,0.102,0.773,0.125

Usually I would dismiss this as just bullshitting from the right (like when they said we will have a lockdown every other week forever) but the fact that the WEF (which is made up of big tech CEOs) makes me kinda scared this could happen in the near future, in the same way an atheist might be made to fear hell if told off for not believing in god(s).While I am very much of the belief private property should ultimately be abolished (and be owned publically, not by companies), personal property such as computers, toothbrushes, equipment, etc should remain in the hands of individuals.Could a fellow Vaushite reassure me on this?",1250,213,-0.8575,0.073,0.88,0.048

4919,VaushV,"I don't know who needs to hear this, but what's happening with Andrew Tate is a textbook example of the life cycle of a right wing influencer/political figure This happens again and again. A right wing douchebag rises to prominence. As they rise, leftists immediately point out why they suck. Liberals do the same, but often prioritize the wrong things (think of how CNN focused so much on Trump's tweets and not his policies). Rightoids fall in love head over heals.Eventually, the right wing douchebag reveals themselves to be such a disgrace and embarrassment that even rightoids can no longer deny it. At this point, rightoids start to distance themselves from the aforementioned douchebag. Think of how rightoids began to distance themselves from George W Bush around 2008/2009 (same time as the 2008 financial crisis and Bush having record low approval ratings) and even began to shamelessly claim the the right was never into him to begin with.The resolution to the cycle usually ends with rightoids just moving on to another douchebag with more or less the same characteristics, all the while claiming that they were never into the previous douchebag (or that the previous douchebag was actually never right wing enough). Often, the cyle ends with liberals weirdly becoming buddy buddy with the douchebag (as what happened with George W Bush).This cycle happened with George W Bush, it happened with Milo Yiannopoulos, it almost happened to Trump after Jan 6th and happened with his whole NFT cringe fest, and it's happening with Andrew Tate right now.",1560,257,-0.9967,0.236,0.722,0.042

4927,VaushV,"Ideas for second Vaush/Zoe Baker convo. Greetings, and sorry for my English.I‚Äôm interested in organizing a second discussion between Zoe Baker(Anarchopac) and Vaush:                               But before such a video can happen, I‚Äôd like to talk about (hopefully with Vaush and Zoe Baker, but not necessarily at the same time.) what will this next video‚Äôs subject be about.       From what I understand, the last video ended with Vaush believing in a Inside/Outside Strategy, and Zoe Baker being for a All Direct Action Strategy.    I believe that the way forward would is to discuss ends and means, can the be different or should they stay the same?            In order to advance the conversation beyond unnecessary topics, I decided to look at what Vaush believes to be right, why he decides certain things are right or wrong to do, and I found this video on YouTube where he explains exactly that:                               Early in the video he says he (I‚Äôm paraphrasing a little) believes in Historical Materialism (essentially ""you need capitalism to get socialism, etc), this explains why he doesn‚Äôt believes that means and ends are not the same, so to speak.                                Therefore I think the best place to continue the conversation beyond the ""Outside/Inside Strategy VS All Direct Action Strategy"" topic is to discuss whether ends/means must be the same or not, and also talk/challenge the assumptions behind the arguments for or against.                                                  In order to make the video more enlightening, I believe we should help Zoe, mainly because Vaush is a great debater and even in good faith it can be hard to have a dialogue when you‚Äôre more used to doing monologues.",1740,270,0.9828,0.036,0.836,0.128

She never said anything about it, we were together for 3 more months, fast forward to year later, she starts telling people i raped her that night. She never said no, but she didn't say yes because after a year in a relationship the transition into sex is obviously natural, she said that she didn't want it inside but she didn't verbally say it in the moment. Her body language was not out of the ordinary but we were both kinda drunk so i may have misread it.

You don't absolve yourself of accountability by claiming to be blackout drunk if you drive a car and kill someone, or otherwise injure or kill someone or damage property. You are still responsible for your own actions. So if you're at a bar by yourself and you get blackout drunk, and you go home with someone you never met before, how can that qualify as rape? You cannot absolve yourself of liability/accountability/responsibility by getting blackout drunk. It's a stupid argument. I live in Norway, and tons of people here don't talk to people when they're sober, and they go out to drink and meet random people to hook up with all the time. When that's part of the culture, you gotta be held responsible for your own actions, even if you're drunk. I think it should be like this everywhere.   If you regret your decisions the following day, it's still not rape. YOU chose to get blackout drunk, and YOU agreed to go home with the other person. You're responsible for yourself!Imagine if people didn't feel shame over fucking someone they wanted to fuck while drunk, but not when they're sober. Imagine if you just count it as a bad decision and learn from it, and avoid being blackout drunk by yourself in the future!

At the end of the day, the situation verbalised that she did not want to go further, anything sexual activity after that is rape. If there is conflicting statements / body language that doesn't matter, the point is that you need to keep yourself/your partner safe and in this context it isn't 100% clear they are consenting, so you need to step back.There are so many additional factors to think about, for example a lot of women will rationalise the sex later as consensual etc they don't want to think of themselves as a victim, will blame themselves for getting in that situation, don't want to lead someone on etc. But even without getting into it, that situation as described is rape.",1038,183,-0.9479,0.131,0.814,0.055

But today on stream Destiny was complaining that the compressor was turning up *everything* that entered the mic and took it out on poor Melina just trying to be a good trad-wife and do some laundry. Here is a guide on how Destiny can set up his mic for optimal results hopefully without peaking or domestic abuse. Maybe he has already fixed it and I'm writing this all for nothing, but it's worth a shot.**Threshold**This knob should be at 0 ¬±  or maybe -3-. In the world of digital audio peaks in a digital format is a nasty ordeal and a no-no and anything above 0 db in a digital audio format is undesirable. To stay safe it should be at -3, but  0 ¬± should be fine.**Ratio**So this is where the magic happens. This should be at  ‚àû . This turns the compressor into a *limiter* with the function of limiting any and all peaks above the threshold which is the effect we're after here. This prevents peaking and should save X amount of peoples ears whenever volumes get loud enough to pass the set threshold.**Gain/Makeup Gain**Leave this knob alone. It should be at 0. I assume turned this knob a bit which increased the volume for everything and made Destiny hear that nasty nasty washing machine now more loudly than before. If Destiny is hearing things louder now that means the compressor is working constantly which is *not* desirable in this instance and all we want is for the compressor/limiter kick in and be active when the volume reaches the threshold and to remove any signal that goes above said threshold.Hopefully this fixes Destiny's issues and if it doesn't I suck I guess.",1858,331,-0.6262,0.107,0.787,0.107

5000,Destiny,"THE ""GOT RHYTHM"" MANIFESTO # THE ""GOT RHYTHM"" MANIFESTOThe ""Got Rhythm"" game played by Destiny on stream, hosted on *concerthotels.com*, is a **FRAUD**. While messing around with the game, I found a major issue with its implementation that makes it completely pointless, deceptive, and non-competitive. There is another smaller, but still annoying, issue that I also look at afterwards. In the following 'festo, I describe these issues, how I found them, and why they make the game a fraud. Finally, I make a couple suggestions for getting around these problems.### ISSUE ONE: *RANDOM SCORING***This game throws off the scoring of your timing by a seemingly random small amount of milliseconds.***Seriously?*Yes. The first thing that is important to understand is the way the scoring functions. The game measures how well your timing was by looking at the time between every two of your clicks. It does *not* measure your timing against a ""hidden beat"" that continues playing through the run. You can test this by following the beat for like 5 clicks, waiting a bunch of time, then continuing again at around the same pace. You will see that your score is negatively affected *only* on the beat where you waited a bunch of time, instead of on every single click after the pause.Why is this important? Because when you use an **auto clicker**, you may not time it correctly initially - however, with this scoring system, it means that you should get a completely flat line, since the timing between the clicks is machine-perfect.That is not what we see.Auto clicker with 500 ms intervalAuto clicker with 460 ms interval (closer to the *actual* interval, which isn't 500 ms for some reason)So either the auto clicker is clicking at slightly random intervals, or the game is adding this randomness to our scores on purpose. I tested this with a macro on Logitech G Hub, and with ""OP Auto Clicker"", making sure no random intervals were activated on either of them.I don't understand who the fuck thought this was a good idea. So disappointing.### ISSUE TWO: *NON-PERFECT DRUM LOOP*While trying the game a bunch I noticed that the drum kick metronome that plays at the start will sometimes suddenly ""skip"" slightly. So I recorded 4 minutes of the drum beat, dropped it into FL Studio and saw that it's actually a 32.05 second recording that loops. Yes, *.05*, because the recording has *50 milliseconds of nothing* attached to the very end of the 32 second loop. Apart from being an ugly way of implementing a looping kick drum, if you get unlucky, this can easily throw you off when trying to time your taps before the kick fades out. This issue is not as important but it's somehow infuriating too.### SOLUTIONMy suggestion is making our own Got Rhythm game with these issues resolved and hosting it on destiny.gg. It could even have a DGG Leaderboard. We'd need to have some clever anti-cheating measures, though, such as a way to detect auto clickers, or also randomizing the BPM between 115 - 125 in decimals (milliseconds), for every run. This could be a fun way to compete amongst ourselves, we could even align our accounts with either PEPE or YEE to see which faction has the best rhythm (kind of pointless though, because YEE neva lose). This would be a bunch of work and I don't feel like doing it, so if anyone is up for it and D-man approves, it could be cool!",3368,580,0.9814,0.045,0.858,0.097

5021,Destiny,"On whether you can clock gay people last stream Dan asked Steven if he thought that he can clock gay people and how there was some study showing that you could indeed do that. I'm assuming that he is remembering this study. The tldr there basically is that the authors trained a machine learning model on a bunch of very unethically sourced selfies and their sexual orientation and were able to make one that correctly identifies them with about 2/3 to 3/4 accuracy. They then claim that this is because sexual orientation is correlated to physiology.In order to see how that is very misleading at best and completely wrong at worst you need to look at the exact methodology. The first detail is that the percentages used in the study don't tell you how often the model correctly identifies the sexuality from a photo, but how often it correctly identifies which photo is of a gay person given one of a gay and one of a straight person. this isn't a huge deal, but it is a very different interpretation than what I'd assume average ppl would expect.  The much bigger problem is that the study worked with photos scraped from a dating site. As such they can't actually tell if the model is picking up on facial features as they claim or is instead just picking up on cultural differences in how ppl take photos of themselves. This article from a machine learning researcher goes into detail about this. The tldr is that you can easily make ""models"" that are as good at identifying gay women as the ones in the study by eg choosing randomly if both or neither wear eye shadow and otherwise saying the one with it is straight. Obviously this is not actually identifying gay people and just identifying a somewhat well known cultural trend.A further study essentially replicated the original study's results. But this time they also trained a model on highly blurred versions of the photos. and by highly blurred they mean literal 5 by 5 pixels! surprisingly this model also achieved similar accuracy, even further suggesting that the original study was not actually telling if someone is gay or not but just some incredibly superficial fact about the photo composition.So to answer Dan's question, Steven is essentially right on this (which we should have expected since it's not a food take), you can sorta tell if someone is gay _as long as they are presenting themselves in a stereotypically gay fashion_.",2405,419,0.9139,0.03,0.91,0.06

5036,Destiny,"General thought regarding Destiny's language I have seen multiple discussions recently from people posting about how Destiny conducts himself in his discussions/debates, especially in regard to the recent Lex interview.  I've only relatively recently started watching his YouTube videos from a friend mentioning him, and so I like to go back and watch older videos as well because I haven't seen them before.  But the issue I run into is that while I like to listen to them in the background at work sometimes, I don't have much access to the videos because I assume they are age restricted or something and my work internet has restricted mode on.I don't really have any issue with the way that Destiny conducts himself, but I think it can be a detriment when many of his videos are unavailable.  I'm sure most people on YouTube don't have restricted mode on, but there's a potential that his videos aren't suggested to new people as much because the algorithm doesn't think he's as ""family friendly"" or whatever.  A great example is that if I were to go to Lex's channel, the Ben Shapiro video is available to watch, but Destiny's isn't.I doubt this is some massive issue long term, but I figure it could just be something to think about and weigh against the benefits of being able to use the more ""explosive"" language that I'm sure he'd rather use.",1352,235,0.9676,0.041,0.831,0.128

5047,Destiny,"""The What vs The Why"" This is something I've wanted to have a discussion about for a while. This is something I call the What vs the Why. It's something I've always noticed growing up and speaking with people from all political sides. This can cause a lot of tension and dismissiveness in people and I believe it should be addressed. I will give a few examples before jumping into more.Before anyone goes ""hurr not Europe"" I am getting out ahead and saying I am referring to America. Where most of us are from.1. Black people are in jail more for crimes.We should all be able to agree with this statement because it's a fact.The issue is when people say this and people push back by talking about socioeconomic reasons and slavery and how maybe they don't have proper education which leads them to crime. Is that true? Yeah. Does it change the fact that they're in jail more from crimes? No. Someone who's talking about police or crimes in neighborhoods isn't going to suddenly change their mind because you say WHY it's happening. Because it doesn't change that it is happening. 2. Jews are over represented in media.Is this true? Yes. Most people agree it's true but it's also pushed back with ""you're implying a secret cabal and calling them evil"" or ""insert reason Dan said the other day""Again all of these reasons don't change the simple observation that there's a lot in media. It's not nefarious to observe something.3. American women  prefer circumcised dicks.If you say this people freak out talking about how it's social conditioning and American women aren't used to it so they don't know better.And again. Those reasons don't change what's true.This came up again in a discussion the other day on stream when lav said ""you can't explain what something is without explaining why""Yes. You can. These things are true regardless of the reasoning why.If someone states these facts and you push back by telling them they're wrong that's one thing.But when you tell them they're wrong then explain they're actually right they just don't understand WHY it comes off as dismissive and makes them think you're being dishonest.It's not hard to bite factual bullets.When you constantly push back on true statements it comes off as Weasley and disingenuous and looks like you aren't properly engaging. It's dismissive.Why something happens doesn't change the fact that it happens. There's times and arguments to go into detail about why something is true. I'm not saying to completely always ignore it. But it's okay to sometimes just acknowledge observations.None of these are statements of morality. It's not saying anything is good or bad. It's simply observing things in reality. Observing things doesn't mean you agree with them. But when people get pushed back on true observations it can alienate people.",2810,473,-0.7095,0.08,0.836,0.084
5048,Destiny,"Lav's Destiny Takedown (Repost) Taken verbatim from here, recorded for posterity\---This is it.I‚Äôve taken a couple days to think, away from the internet, away from my home and computer, spoken to multiple professionals and have decided to close this casket publically. Before I do, I want to be clear and concise in what I‚Äôve learned and felt over the past week. An announcement:I will not be streaming anymore. Effective immediately and possible indefinetly. I will perhaps participate in some debates, sparingly andas a guest appearance, but my focus will be on my YouTube channel, developing my own body of content. Im not built for this panel world. I am too aggressive to be as sensitive as I am. I make a fool of myself, I lose my message. I don‚Äôt navigate social situations well as an autistic person, and I don‚Äôt have enough practice under my belt to be able to responsibly put myself in tricky social situations in stream. Maybe some day. Probably not, though.ILL BE ON THIS PATREON THOUGH. . (Twitter probably needs to go, but I can not part with itThis world has taken up my life. To my detriment, I have worked hard.I‚Äôm addicted to approval, I‚Äôm addicted to proving myself. All of this hurts me. I couldn‚Äôt stop. I have to stop.I have dreams outside of the online that I need to pursue.Overall, the narcissistic world of entertainment, has not bode me well. I left the music industry for the same reason. Something I thought was fun, turned into an ego feed, turned in to self harm, turned in to me spiraling. I don‚Äôt want to be famous. I don‚Äôt want these many eyes on me. It hurts. But It‚Äôs addicting. To someone like me, who grew up without parents, to have eyes on me, the potential for love, the potential to prove im worthy of attention and adoration and love‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it‚Äôs heroin. But I can‚Äôt get that from you guys, ultimately. It‚Äôs fickle. I can only get that from me.But without further ado, what you all came for.I don‚Äôt care about the safety of keeping this inside my mouth and chest. Do your worst. I have nothing left to lose.It sucks to come out. It does. It sucks to be a woman who comes out about someone bigger than you. This is my second time. Unfortunately men in power or with big platforms seem to have a propensity to abuse it.This time is different. This time for a week straight, day and night I had hundreds of thousands of people trying to gaslight me or just downright hurling abuse at me.Going public with sexual instances is embarrassing, and even more embarrassing when someone tries to come forward with that information for you.People have decided to relay my personal story with Steven, that I told to a friend privately.I should not trust friends online.And I‚Äôm going to lay it out for you concisely‚Ä¶. and I‚Äôm never going to speak of it again. Steven and I did not have sex. We hooked up. I was nervous because I‚Äôd not been with many uncircumcised men. He was fine with that.I went home after, I felt good about what had happened.I did not open my relationship for Steven, I did not close it because of Steven.What I didn‚Äôt anticipate was becoming part of stevens orbit in the way I had. I did not knowingly consent to a scenario Of being evaluated for my performance, being told I brought views and clicks and content, and existing in the social contract I did, after having a sexual dynamic with him, and I didn‚Äôt realize how many of the women in the orbit had the same social contract I did.This was enough to just make me feel, strange.Another thing that made me feel strange was when I begged Steven to do as little as tell him community to go easier on me on the platforms he could control. He deletes some of his fans critism of him on the Reddit, I thought it would be easy. Apparently, it wasn‚Äôt. And I was publically embarrassed for weeks, being gaslit that I couldn‚Äôt take accountability for how dumb and irritating and annoying I was, and I just had to admit all of those things and then we‚Äôd reevaluate. Steven even said I was using DARVO abuse tactics when I was expressing my feelings.The thing that made me feel the weirdest was finding out Steven was sexting and still seeking sex from Ana, who for years he publically embarrassed and acknowledged was not only ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù but also completely obsessed with him and the consensus in the community has been she‚Äôs a psycho stalker and stevens done little to nothing to quell that idea and exploit Ana‚Äôs sobs and mental breakdown for views.This, is abusive. It was the cherry on top that nobody knew about it, and the nuts sprinkled over everything was that Ana told me she felt like she had to do it in order to feel safe from Steven.this resonated.The first time Steven and I spoke off stream, he decided to tell me this huge ‚Äúcareer ending‚Äù\*secret, and I bartered with my own secret. He‚Äôd alluded to it in messages, baiting me. And I had to know. We were strangers, and he told me.\*there‚Äôs nothing career ending about this secret. Not for him: it‚Äôs why he so often teases it. He wears it like a badge of honor. He smiles every time he brings it up on stream. He laughed while telling me.I‚Äôm not keeping an abusers secrets. I‚Äôm done.It was about sexual indiscretions about someone other than his wife. An affair, his wife didn‚Äôt know the extent of. And he said he was never going to tell her. He didn‚Äôt want to ruin anything because he had jumped the gun and broken up with Melina before he knew this other woman had wanted him. She didn‚Äôt, and he went back. I thought, okay this is not really my business and I don‚Äôt know Melina.Steven says he doesn‚Äôt care if this gets out because it only hurts the other woman. He‚Äôs said this on stream multiple times. So, alas. I‚Äôm not going to mention the other woman because this has nothing to do with her.And here I am, a stranger, holding this secret. Me, a stranger, pleading with him to tell his wife about his misconduct. I say secrets hurt people, resentment builds, he assures he‚Äôs fine and will probably never tell her. I ask if this is going to affect him, he repeats for the 70th time to me, he is a sociopath and he doesn‚Äôt and won‚Äôt care.Make no mistake. He wants people to know this secret. He wants to embarrass Melina and the other woman involved. It‚Äôs why he teases it on stream. It‚Äôs why he tells every orbiter , it why he told me. A stranger he wanted to have sex with. People with secrets they don‚Äôt want people to know do not tease it on a stream with 15k people.A day or two before meeting in person we spoke on the phone again, and I had asked him about his relationship history because it seemed very toxic to me, being that he was cheating on his wife and the only other public relationships I knew of, online, were toxic. And he told me this really fun story of this time he and his ex worked together and he was sleeping with another co-worker. His ex went to all of their boss to tell him Steven was sleeping with a coworker and he lied to his boss about it, denying it, saying she was a psycho and psychotic and she sobbed and freaked out in the office, and got fired. And he liked it. And they continued to have sex, and brought up the situation during sex. Because he literally, got off on it.I thought he told me this to be edgy, the way men often do. But it made me uncomfortable and I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. We hung up moments later and I felt confused but we‚Äôd already made the plans to hang out.When we hung out I asked him about Ana and chaeiry, He‚Äôd repeated the usual, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre psycho, I love toxic women. It‚Äôs exciting, it‚Äôs good content‚Äù I think I scoffed. He tells me Ana was a stalker but he‚Äôs over it, again because he‚Äôs a sociopath and he doesn‚Äôt care much.That‚Äôs the thing, Steven is so charming he could be saying literally anything and you feel like you‚Äôre in on it. I thought, yea. She is psycho. I‚Äôm different.He frequently repeated ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see how you‚Äôll turn out‚Äù like he either expected me to be psychotic, he was hoping I‚Äôd be, or I‚Äôd have to prove myself that I wasn‚Äôt. I chose the last one.Didn‚Äôt pan out, I guess. Not the way he sees it.I didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôd been sexting. If I‚Äôd have known, I wouldnt have continued to hang out with him. Because that‚Äôs abusive. And I don‚Äôt have sexual relationships with abusive men.Fast forward. I reach out to Ana almost a week ago. I‚Äôm feeling low because dgg hates me, and they‚Äôre following me across platforms to leave nasty comments. And I‚Äôm starting to feel weird that Steven gaslit me and uploaded the video of me crying on his YouTube.And she very willingly tells me, they still have a sexual relationship.That‚Äôs when I decided I‚Äôd never stream with him again.Ana tells me he told her he likes to watch me embarrass myself on stream. I remember the ex wife story, the big secret. I remember the way I found out who he was, through the Ana streams being recommended to me on YouTube, He does , he likes this.And it‚Äôs when I went on stream to say he was borderline abusive (I didn‚Äôt have the balls or the words to say it with my full chest) and I thought the power dynamic and lack of care he had for my well-being was uncomfortable enough to not stream with him anymore. (Something I thought would be a relief to his community and neutral to Steven) I immediately, was met with disdain. People jumping down my throat telling me I was horrible for coming out about it, very few people questioning why I‚Äôd said it. Or thinking critically about the power structure I felt I‚Äôd been in, where he used his orbiters as content, teeing us up for vitriol and not controlling the narrative he could‚Äôve easily controlled, or at the very least told his community to stop mass linking pictures of me without makeup.I‚Äôd gone from 80 views to 1600 on my stream. But I‚Äôd stopped talking about it at 400. I didn‚Äôt know the can of worms i was opening. I didn‚Äôt understand the culture of dgg, I thought I‚Äôd had an idea, but this was‚Ä¶.big.Then Steven went on stream and called max a rapist. And hurled that he was the most manipulative person he‚Äôd ever met, and I was just his next victim.Max comes on to assert he wasn‚Äôt going behind stevens back as a backstab, but because Ana had told him they were still sexting, it was abusive, and he wanted to know what else Steven has been doing. Because max also knows about stevens ‚Äúsecret‚Äù, because max has heard what everyone has heard about Steven being notorious, he‚Äôs experienced his own emotional detachment and abuse from Steven, and he wants to make sure a man he called his friend is not serially abusing women. He uses the public information, that Ana came forward about a week earlier on her stream (that they are still sexting and sexual) and reminds Steven why he‚Äôs questioning women.Ana, who had spent days detailing carefully stevens abuse of her, too scared to leave his side. She does a 180, and lies about max manipulating her into giving her story to absolve her of any wrongdoing. She gets to be a victim. I was on that call. She never said no. She had spent hours prior giving her consent, readings out text messages. She was excited to come forward with this information because she finally thought she had a team assembled who cared about her. But the reception was bad. And she froze, and she went back to what she knew. Steven.So she gets to be a victim. She says max manipulated her and Steven welcomes her with open arms because now,Max is the enemy. Max is the evil.I‚Äôll be honest. I wanted that out.I wanted it so bad. Id already spent hours getting harassed by dgg, seeing what the subreddit was saying. I was useless, evil, disgusting. This hit my mom-wound. I am so scared of being these things. I wanted to take solace in the out Steven gave me. I wanted to be a victim of max so bad. I wanted to avoid the dogpile and go back to my epic highs and lows of debating on stevens channel. The attention, the lights, the in-group. I wanted it.I wanted to curl up next to Steven and repeat how bad max was. I wanted safety from the avalanche that would inevitably come.But I knew I couldn‚Äôt.Because I knew he abused Ana, I knew he lied to his wife. And I‚Äôm a feminist. It‚Äôs what I built my platform on. I don‚Äôt associate with abusive men. I won‚Äôt keep their secrets.At this point I didn‚Äôt think Steven was REALLY a sociopath. I didn‚Äôt think he was doing it on purpose, how could I? Steven HAD been kind to me. He‚Äôs a charming, likable guy. I messaged him saying I thought he needed to get help. See a therapist, maybe it was sex addiction, maybe he was stuck in his relationship, maybe it was intrapersonal.I called him after his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nuclear‚Äù stream.And he gaslit me for 2 hours straight.Assured he checked on me, did everything he could to be a good friend. Assured me he was an incredible friend, he‚Äôd checked on me once. I said I was okay‚Ä¶so really It was actually my fault . I‚Äôd been manipulating him‚Ä¶.because I told him I was okay to get back on stream. Of course I did. Who wouldn‚Äôt? I‚Äôd sobbed on that stream, made a diary entry. He‚Äôd acknowledged I wasn‚Äôt fit for stream. Yet, he‚Äôd say a day later my spiral was good content. Everyone has a piece of responsibility pie.he repeated I didn‚Äôt deserve his charitably, he was just so charitable and such a good friend, I was crazy. But I didn‚Äôt have to be. And I still had a chance to be in his good graces if I denounced max. He said I needed help. That if I just woke up I‚Äôd see everything max was saying was a lie. And I nodded and stopped at the thought. The golden out. My solace.And lastly he‚Äôd brought up the secret I‚Äôd told him.Out of nowhere. So out of place in the conversation.The secret I‚Äôd told him when he told me his secret. Told me it would ruin me, how bad I‚Äôd look. He‚Äôd worked it in. I‚Äôm not going to be blackmailed.Hasan piker slept with my very young friend when he was not so young. It was legal. But he‚Äôs denounced men publically for doing much less. I don‚Äôt care about it. And she‚Äôs never going to come forward, but the fact exists nonetheless. An example of hipocrisy. Another persons Hipocrisy is gold to a streamer. A shiny weapon. I was armed. Nothing will come of it. Ethically it is a small infranction. And it won‚Äôt be held over my head.I‚Äôd tried to get max and Steven to talk in the call. Max begrudgingly came. Steven refused to say anything. Called him a rapist again, and max left with his integrity, having done me the favor of joining the call because he could see I was desperately trying to fix the mess. And Steven had typed ‚Äúshe‚Äôs self harming, help come quick‚Äù and so max has come, quickly to see if it were true. Steven just laughed at how stupid it was for max to care if I was cutting myself on this VC call.Unbeknownst to me while on the call he‚Äôd been writing to dgg ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saving the lav bridge‚Äùhe tells me out loud ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm having a 40k viewer conversation offline‚Äù. I try to chuckle at the comment. Then I redirect-and then assures dgg, again, unbeknownst to me ‚Äúmaybe I can get her on tomorrow‚Äù. I‚Äôd just told him the chances of me coming on in the next months were zero, but maybe after, one on one. I‚Äôd just said this. He knew I wasn‚Äôt coming on, and he hadn‚Äôt discussed with me that he was relaying this information to dgg.But he only exists on these streams. His community is him. He doesn‚Äôt want to have the conversation anymore, he‚Äôs checked out. He‚Äôs tried to convince me max is manipulating me and he thinks it‚Äôs worked. We hang up.I woke up the next morning to see Ana had taken the ‚Äúout‚Äù. It was the safer option. But it had made me so angry. I‚Äôd started to believe Steven was the good guy, because how couldn‚Äôt he have been? He‚Äôd platformed me, so new to the game, I didn‚Äôt deserve it. he‚Äôd met up with me, and was‚Ä¶sweet albeit a bit detached‚Ä¶but max was a good guy. And I could swear he wasn‚Äôt manipulating me. And Ana had spun this web out of control.I was so, so, so angry at Ana. I thought she‚Äôd sold me something. Steven re-assured me she was crazy and looping the night before. And he forgave her, and he could forgive me too if I just‚Ä¶.denounced max.Max assures me this is exactly how an abused woman acts. I google it because I don‚Äôt trust him. (4000 people are telling me I‚Äôm a pawn in max‚Äôs game. I am skeptical of max)I should not have publically trashed her, and I should not have gone in that panel in the emotional state I was in.I went on chuds panel after being gaslit by Steven.Again, I shouldn‚Äôt have. Because I did not have it correct. I hadn‚Äôt spoken to my therapist in a week, I‚Äôm getting mounds and mounds of shit and hate pummeled at me. I just wanted to make it better. I just wanted everyone to be better. I couldn‚Äôt believe Ana had lied. After all the ways she called Steven evil I couldn‚Äôt believe she‚Äôd re-pledge allegiance. I wanted to make everything better.I got off chuds stream after a desperate plea to the audience to leave my loved ones alone. (It only emboldened them) and watch stevens stream to self harm.I‚Äôm watching Kyla literally do whatever she can to gain favor in the same way I was incentivized to , on stream.I‚Äôve known the feeling of in group signaling. I‚Äôve known my place in this machine. I‚Äôve been Kyla.There is a weak orbiter, you need to solidify your place.I did this with max.Remind the audience you‚Äôre there. And you‚Äôre good. And you‚Äôre here to stay.Steven is still, blaze√©.Steven sits there watching me on chud logics panel and calmly chuckles at my tears and sobs. He chuckles. He laughs. Despite the conversation we‚Äôd had the night before. He enjoys the content I create. He enjoys my implosion. Womens ults, make for great media.He drags me through the mud.My stocks, burned to the groundMy stocks are gone.My worth, my wealth. Decimated. I am unworthy of human-NessKyla speaks.She is better than me. She is smarter, she is more put together, she is wiser and older, and best of all the audience loves her. I‚Äôve been constantly reminded. Even by her, a multitude of times.And she goes off on a tangent, and Steven is not even listening. She may realize this is happening.He moves the conversation without giving her the validation she needs.She stays silent until it‚Äôs her turn to perform again.Aba comes onHe‚Äôs right, victory lap. He was right all along.He says ‚ÄúI get to shine‚Äù.And he does, so bright.And it burnsKyla has to take her stage again, she wants to share the stage. She wants to shine. She wants to share.Kyla says Steven is simply too likable, that is his problem. His response‚ÄúCringe‚ÄùSteven is the victim.I‚Äôm reminded of how small and silly this world is.this very small place, Steven can control. It‚Äôs his. He calls himself a sociopath 4 times; and his orbiters jump to empathy.No you‚Äôre not a sociopath. You‚Äôre just hurt. You‚Äôre just so‚Ä¶hurt. Please, just admit you actually are upset by this, I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you, again. You can‚Äôt trust anyone. You‚Äôre too forgiving.He makes excuses for max. Now. He shmoozes. He masturbates to his audience. He gets to have empathy for max. He is the victor, he is the guy.He is god!Max is Judas.But Steven has empathy for Judas.He ejactulates his empathy into the audience.Aba asks Steven , almost on the money, SO CLOSE, he asks why uses us as entertainment. But somehow, it‚Äôs not stevens fault. Not his responsibility. It can‚Äôt be. It is maxs. It is mine. Aba says it‚Äôs max and I‚Äôs fault. We are bad people. We are bad people for wanting to use the big opportunity we‚Äôve been given by a big streamer with no boundaries, Steven is just too good.And I can not speak. I won‚Äôt. I am already burned. Already scalded. Nothing I say is correct, I live in delusion. My narrative is up in the air. I can say nothing. I watch horrified.Stevens reminds Kyla he is a sociopath, and she does not believe him. And he even calls her kyra. The wrong name.Steven explains to Kyla how he uses us for content.And Kyla does not listen to him tell her who he isHe is telling her who he is,And she does not hear himHe said it again, he is a sociopath, he doesn‚Äôt care about thisShe does not believe him.I wonder what would happen if a friend were to ask him what he‚Äôd done wrongHe calls max a narcissist. For a year he‚Äôs groaned about armchair psychiatry and peer diagnosis. It doesn‚Äôt pertain. Not to max. Steven KNOWS what max is.Kyla scrambles to tell Steven he‚Äôs a good person deep down and needs better friends and richnessAnd StevenCalls her a ‚Äúmax‚ÄùA weapon.He says she‚Äôs mind raping him. That he is just this person. He just doesn‚Äôt feel.Kyla goes silent.Shot dead with ‚Äúmax‚Äù bullets.Max, who was one of his closest friends, a week before.He promises for the 3rd day in a row to nuke all mention of me. He doesn‚Äôt. The engagement is too good. He doesn‚Äôt.Kelly jean says she wound me up on purpose. She knew it‚Äôd be easy after I cried on stream. She knows I‚Äôm spiraling. She likes it because I exploded on her in a panel and I have differing views on sex work.So I am no longer human.She said she‚Äôd think it was fun. Kyla, the psychology buff, laughs. Steven laughs, Everyone laughs. Then is a half hearted sigh of disappointment and they move onI message max, sobbing. He is his usual self. Caring, there when I need him but vaguely distant because he knows I don‚Äôt trust him, and he doesn‚Äôt want our narratives to get mixed up when we‚Äôre both emotional. He is hyper aware of the manipulative narcissist label that‚Äôs been hurled at him. He wants to keep us both safe.Shaelin asks if I‚Äôm eatingMax mostly just tells me to write how I feel.I do. I write this. I look back up at stevens stream.And last, Steven reads a text from Ana.Ana laughs at me. She jokes about me and max. We are crazy. I am crazy.but nowI am Ana.And she laughs, and steven laughs.And the stream chat roars with favor for her. I‚Äôm reminded of the text she sent Steven in those screenshots, ‚Äúyour community likes me now‚Äùshe is safe.And the chat fills‚ÄúAna stocks are up‚Äù.I know Steven will see this, and continue the hurl. He‚Äôll go over the poorly made hit piece, lying about every personal aspect of my life. The one made by a self proclaimed white supremesist, the one who said my heart condition is really just a meth overdose(lol). He‚Äôll try to do everything he can to discredit me and max, he already called max a rapist. I wonder what he‚Äôll call me. I won‚Äôt be listening to hear it. What‚Äôs he got to discredit? Ill fall into oblivion with my fianc√© and cats. His platform will get bigger.I‚Äôve gone over every detail in that video. I‚Äôd never levied a false rape allegation. I‚Äôve never had a gofundmescam. I go over this, I made a statement in my announcements on my discord. This is old, years old, fake news. But it‚Äôs shiny. It‚Äôs new. It fits the narrative that I‚Äôm evil. I get it, I watch those videos. They‚Äôre fun. I hope Steven enjoys it. I hope everyone here enjoys it.But I am free. The cycle continues, but I am not in it.",22735,4182,-0.9952,0.131,0.746,0.123

This is fine when it comes to people who have a much lower social media presence, who hangs out around him. But people are calling Aba an orbiter. I have even seen a few people call Lex an orbiter. This feels really disrespectful, because these are people who have worked hard and built up their own platforms, which are bigger than destiny's. This is cringe.Now, imagine that you are friends with someone, probably because you genuinely enjoy their company. However, there are like thousands of people who are watching, and rating you on a friendship scale. You are forced to participate in the teenage highschool girl-esque drama where everybody is evaluated on their friendship scale. The buddy of the year thing kinda feels like that to me.Now, I don't want to speak for anyone involved, but I would be extremely uncomfortable with something like this happening. Even if you don't really pay a lot of attention to the subreddit, it also pops up on the stream chat and YouTube comments. I remember Aba voicing objection to being labelled an orbiter, albeit subtly. I don't think that the content creators are especially thrilled about the new orbiter stock market website. It can be fun to take sides and participate in this type of three-way drama (team Edward or Jacob?) . But I think that it is getting a bit out of hand.

5063,Destiny,"Why Destiny is wrong and Biden's Ukraine policy actually SUCKS, aka The Nuclear War Manifesto v0.1 Background: *I have a Master‚Äôs Degree in International Relations + I am Ukrainian (also 6‚Äô3‚Äù, 210 lbs, 8.5‚Äù). I am working on a much longer effortpost on this topic, but since Dylan brought it up last night, I will publish this* ***very simplified version*** *to pregame the audience for (what I assume) Dylan‚Äôs argument will be in regards to why Ukraine should be receiving more aid. I also welcome any and all feedback!***TL;DR**: Limiting categories of conventional weapons available to Ukraine is illogical and/or cowardly. The US should lift the restrictions currently in place and provide Ukraine with the systems they have been requesting in order to end the conflict quicker and limit the damage it does to Ukraine and the world as a whole.**THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS:** For the purposes of this post, I take the default IR assumption of **‚ÄúStates will use nuclear weapons when faced with an imminent existential threat‚Äù.** I also assume that **any use of a nuclear weapon by Russia would trigger a direct NATO military intervention.** Finally, I assume that **any nuclear exchange is tantamount to MAD**.  I personally have objections to every one of these assumptions, and will dispute them in the longer version of the post, but they work fine for the argument I‚Äôm making here + these also seem to roughly be the assumptions that Destiny is operating from.Note: The West/NATO/the US may be used interchangeably throughout this post, as it appears the US is the party that decides, or at least dictates the international aid policies for Ukraine. Also, this post will focus exclusively on **military aid**.**THE CURRENT STRATEGY**: Prior to 2022, the West, led by the US, did not provide Ukraine with military aid in any significant quantities. After Russia launched a full-scale war against Ukraine on February 24th, this policy changed dramatically ‚Äî Ukraine has now been provided with tens of billions $ in military aid, most notably including systems like the HIMARS MLRS and the wide variety of self-propelled artillery guns from different NATO states.However, many categories of military aid seem to be **off-limits** for Ukraine. In the simplest terms, these include:1. **Basically anything Western-made that has a big gun, except for artillery** ‚Äî jets, attack helicopters, tanks, IFVs like the German-made Marder and the US-made Bradley, some types of APCs, large attack drones, etc.2. **Ballistic Missiles of any range** ‚Äî the most obvious example here are the ATACMS long-range missiles for the HIMARS system, which can reach as far as 300 km or 185 miles.3. **Long-range Air Defense Systems** ‚Äî this one is not a guarantee, but seeing how none of the systems provided thus far have been long-range, this is probably a fair assumption.4. **Complete Jets from Non-Western Manufacturers** ‚Äî information on the deliveries of non-Western Jets is scarce, but at the very least the US has shown itself to be afraid of delivering complete non-Western airframes on multiple occasions. (1) (2)5. **Target Choice** ‚Äî it would appear that the Ukrainians are not allowed to **attack internationally recognized Russian territory** with at least some of the Western-made weapons. I suspect the West has some thoughts about Crimea as well, but we‚Äôll find out when the Ukrainians get there.Other restrictions may exist, but these are the most important ones that I‚Äôm aware of.**WHY THE CURRENT STRATEGY SUCKS**: It is really difficult to tell what the guiding principle behind the aforementioned categoric restrictions and the US military aid delivery process is in general. There have been hints about this from the Biden admin and other foreign leaders, but I think this recent Obama quote on Pod Save America is probably the best summary of the mindset of American decision-makers:‚Äú*We do have to be honest about what we can and cannot do. There are lines that we have to determine internally, that take into account* ***the risk of this tipping into a Russia - US/NATO conflict***\*. \[...\] Thinking about where\* ***defense stops and offense begins*** *and how we manage that is something that we have to pay attention to*.‚ÄùYou have no idea how triggered I was when I first heard this. I could go on for days about how absolutely moronic this approach is, but I‚Äôll try to summarize it laconically (keep in mind the **key assumptions**):1. The idea that Ukraine could pose an **EXISTENTIAL** threat to Russia or that it has any desire to **take ACTUAL Russian territory** is **patently insane.** I can not believe that anyone seriously thinks this. If, somehow, this does come to pass and Zelenskyy transforms into Hitler upon sniffing an M1A2 Abrams, the US could simply **cut the aid** or even **aid Russia**, instead of sitting on our hands while hundreds of thousands of people die.2. Assuming rationality, the risk of a Russia/NATO conflict beginning as a result of this is **ZERO**. If you‚Äôre getting **whooped** by an enemy that is supposed to be weaker than you, and you decide that your way to change this is to **open a second front against an enemy that is 100 TIMES STRONGER THAN YOU, you are patently insane.** If we **do not assume rationality**, then we are basically just f\*cked, and the only way out of **any** issue that may arise is to eliminate the irrational decision-makers.Now, the more specific stuff:3) **Who gives a f\*ck about who the manufacturer of a particular weapon is?** Why is it okay to give Ukraine HUNDREDS of Soviet-made tanks, but a SINGLE Western-made tank would send Russia into a nuclear frenzy? This is basically Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúPut Chinese flags on F-22s and bomb Russia‚Äù joke, except they think this way for real.4) **Wtf is the rationale behind providing MASSIVE numbers of artillery, but no tanks, IFVs, etc?** At this point, HUNDREDS of NATO-built artillery pieces have been delivered. Western tanks, which are often built on the same chassis that the arty pieces are, are for whatever reason completely off-limits.5) **Why should Russia be able to engage in essentially total war, while the country DEFENDING itself has to pull punches?** If you start a war, you obviously f\*cking consent to being struck back. Demanding that the Ukrainians refrain from destroying the missile systems that are blowing their cities to bits from Russian territory is ridiculous, and sets a precedent comparably harmful to the appeasement of nuclear blackmailers, which has been discussed extensively by Destiny.6) **The jet thing. Holy f\*ck, it is so unbelievably idiotic.** Based on all of the evidence I‚Äôve seen so far, it seems that the US isn‚Äôt okay with providing **complete Soviet-made airframes**, but is okay with delivering those SAME airframes in a **disassembled state**. I won‚Äôt even attempt to rationalize this.There is a lot more, like the US government officials constantly lying and stalling in regards to the ATACMS missiles, the weirdly slow pace at which aid is actually being delivered, etc. Going into detail about EVERYTHING would take for too long, however, so I‚Äôll wrap this section here.**THE CORRECT STRATEGY:** Make every conventional weapon that is available to NATO available for Ukraine as well. Unless NATO wishes to supply Ukraine with aircraft carriers, this wouldn‚Äôt even be **escalatory**, as Russia has already been using **all other types of conventional weapons** since Day 1 of the invasion. Furthermore, this would be in line with historical precedent ‚Äî Russia did not feel the need to restrict itself in this manner for the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Syria, etc.**SOME COUNTERARGUMENTS (use strawman voice)**:1. **What about the potential threat to Putin‚Äôs regime?** Does not matter. Threats to regime stability excuse neither conventional nor nuclear war. By this logic the US is entitled to attack Russia over Russiagate, and China is entitled to attack Taiwan as it delegitimizes the CCP‚Äôs autocratic style of governance by the simple fact of it being a liberal democracy. Enabling this would literally be WORSE than enabling the variation of nuclear blackmail that‚Äôs been discussed thus far.2. **What about the logistics?** Logistics can be challenging, but using this as an argument against delivering certain categories of equipment is pure cope. Almost all Western weapons are also operated by dozens of countries across the globe. Furthermore, Ukraine itself has successfully integrated dozens if not hundreds of Western systems since the start of the war, and there hasn‚Äôt been a shred of evidence indicating that any of them have encountered insurmountable logistics challenges.**P.S.:** More juicy effortposts coming soon. If one of the privileged DGGers would be kind enough to link this to Destiny, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it ‚Äî I have HUGE disagreements with him on the topic of Ukraine, and would like to debate him sometime if possible.**TL;DR**: Limiting categories of conventional weapons available to Ukraine is illogical and/or cowardly. The US should lift the restrictions currently in place and provide Ukraine with the systems they have been requesting in order to end the conflict quicker and limit the damage it does to Ukraine and the world as a whole.",9244,1498,-0.999,0.134,0.797,0.069

There have been hints about this from the Biden admin and other foreign leaders, but I think this recent Obama quote on Pod Save America is probably the best summary of the mindset of American decision-makers: ‚Äú*We do have to be honest about what we can and cannot do. There are lines that we have to determine internally, that take into account* ***the risk of this tipping into a Russia - US/NATO conflict****. \[...\] Thinking about where* ***defense stops and offense begins*** *and how we manage that is something that we have to pay attention to*.‚ÄùYou have no idea how triggered I was when I first heard this. I could go on for days about how absolutely moronic this approach is, but I‚Äôll try to summarize it laconically (keep in mind the **key assumptions**):1) The idea that Ukraine could pose an **EXISTENTIAL** threat to Russia or that it has any desire to **take ACTUAL Russian territory** is **patently insane.** I can not believe that anyone seriously thinks this. If, somehow, this does come to pass and Zelenskyy transforms into Hitler upon sniffing an M1A2 Abrams, the US could simply **cut the aid** or even **aid Russia**, instead of sitting on our hands while hundreds of thousands of people die. 2) Assuming rationality, the risk of a Russia/NATO conflict beginning as a result of this is **ZERO**. If you‚Äôre getting **whooped** by an enemy that is supposed to be weaker than you, and you decide that your way to change this is to **open a second front against an enemy that is 100 TIMES STRONGER THAN YOU, you are patently insane.** If we **do not assume rationality**, then we are basically just f\*cked, and the only way out of **any** issue that may arise is to eliminate the irrational decision-makers.Now, the more specific stuff:3) **Who gives a f\*ck about who the manufacturer of a particular weapon is?** Why is it okay to give Ukraine HUNDREDS of Soviet-made tanks, but a SINGLE Western-made tank would send Russia into a nuclear frenzy? This is basically Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúPut Chinese flags on F-22s and bomb Russia‚Äù joke, except they think this way for real.4) **Wtf is the rationale behind providing MASSIVE numbers of artillery, but no tanks, IFVs, etc?** At this point, HUNDREDS of NATO-built artillery pieces have been delivered. Western tanks, which are often built on the same chassis that the arty pieces are, are for whatever reason completely off-limits.5) **Why should Russia be able to engage in essentially total war, while the country DEFENDING itself has to pull punches?** If you start a war, you obviously f\*cking consent to being struck back. Demanding that the Ukrainians refrain from destroying the missile systems that are blowing their cities to bits from Russian territory is ridiculous, and sets a precedent comparably harmful to the appeasement of nuclear blackmailers, which has been discussed extensively by Destiny.6) **The jet thing. Holy f\*ck, it is so unbelievably idiotic.** Based on all of the evidence I‚Äôve seen so far, it seems that the US isn‚Äôt okay with providing **complete Soviet-made airframes**, but is okay with delivering those SAME airframes in a **disassembled state**. I won‚Äôt even attempt to rationalize this.There is a lot more, like the US government officials constantly lying and stalling in regards to the ATACMS missiles, the weirdly slow pace at which aid is actually being delivered, etc. Going into detail about EVERYTHING would take for too long, however, so I‚Äôll wrap this section here.**THE CORRECT STRATEGY:** Make every conventional weapon that is available to NATO available for Ukraine as well. Unless NATO wishes to supply Ukraine with aircraft carriers, this wouldn‚Äôt even be **escalatory**, as Russia has already been using **all other types of conventional weapons** since Day 1 of the invasion. Furthermore, this would be in line with historical precedent ‚Äî Russia did not feel the need to restrict itself in this manner for the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Syria, etc. **SOME COUNTERARGUMENTS (use strawman voice)**: 1) **What about the potential threat to Putin‚Äôs regime?** Does not matter. Threats to regime stability excuse neither conventional nor nuclear war. By this logic the US is entitled to attack Russia over Russiagate, and China is entitled to attack Taiwan as it delegitimizes the CCP‚Äôs autocratic style of governance by the simple fact of it being a liberal democracy. Enabling this would literally be WORSE than enabling the variation of nuclear blackmail that‚Äôs been discussed thus far.2) **What about the logistics?** Logistics can be challenging, but using this as an argument against delivering certain categories of equipment is pure cope. Almost all Western weapons are also operated by dozens of countries across the globe. Furthermore, Ukraine itself has successfully integrated dozens if not hundreds of Western systems since the start of the war, and there hasn‚Äôt been a shred of evidence indicating that any of them have encountered insurmountable logistics challenges. **P.S.:** More juicy effortposts coming soon. If one of the privileged DGGers would be kind enough to link this to Destiny, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it ‚Äî I have HUGE disagreements with him on the topic of Ukraine, and would like to debate him sometime if possible. **TL;DR**: Limiting categories of conventional weapons available to Ukraine is illogical and/or cowardly. The US should lift the restrictions currently in place and provide Ukraine with the systems they have been requesting in order to end the conflict quicker and limit the damage it does to Ukraine and the world as a whole.",9235,1506,-0.999,0.135,0.795,0.069

Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.*  *I know because I‚Äôve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.**But there is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.*However, later on in the speech Biden defines ""MAGA republicans"" as the following:*MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards ‚Äî backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.*Almost all republicans are pro-life, and almost all the christian ones would prefer some kind of civil union system rather than religious marriage for gay couples.

Destiny feels like if Melina does not like how he acts she should just leave, as he would be perfectly fine to trade Melina for his current lifestyle, to expect him to hold back either from working to much or contact crazies is way to big of an ask even if its just to cut back a little bit.In Destiny's defence as he mentioned yesterday when they first met Melina was way more poly than she seems to be now, which he said is fair people change over time. But i think he has changed as well as that time has passed, i think his addiction to crazy people has massively increased since he and Melina got together, and as Melina said yesterday she did not expect the amount of crazy that has come. i dont remember the amount of crazy when he and Eris or Bella were together but tbf they were not open.This also may be speculation on my part but it seems from an outside view his respect of Melina's has dropped over time as well, where before he would try to compromise, it seems now he does some time whatever he wants regardless of what she thinks.Hopefully Melina can figure out what she's willing to tolerate or come to terms with in the relationship,.Destiny's views are quite clear and i dont think he will change, so it remains to see what she will do.",1566,290,0.0257,0.074,0.845,0.081

But this is the first time I've been scared to post for fear of getting banned. Firstly I'm no fan of Redacted,  I thought his hitpiece on Dr K was transparent clout farming and hated the dude ever since. But I did think his criticism of this sub was fair. How did the community of a streamer known for debating anyone so easily justify banning all major disagreement. I'm no free speech absolutionist, arguing that speech can never cause enough harm to justify just silencing them is a losing one, but I think there should be better justification for a ban than 'this person has clearly not put enough thougt or effort into this post'or however it's phrased. Does anyone really think they are capable of determining who has properly thought out ideas and who hasn't, especially on posts about themselves or people that they really like (or genuinely obsessed with in some cases).What has this done? It's lead to new levels of toxicity, just look at the comments under anything related to the Redacted folk. Again I don't even agree with them but some of you guys show such an extreme level of hate it's making me feel guilty. This is entirely to do with the moderation policy of this subreddit (and other Destiny related forums). You've lost any ability to empathize with those you disagree with. You're ability to tolerate or entertain incorrect opinions (subjective of course) has atrophied, while you become increasingly defensive of the ones you do agree with. But most importantly it's lead to the acceptance of extreme actions on your side. As you hide from these stupid people whose opinions aren't even worth considering you continue to build up this image of a npc who will never understand. This leads to anger at the futility of trying to convince them. Then finally to outright hostility (I mean it's pointless arguing with them anyway) and the dropping of all attempts at good faith. Thus leading to a community that many, now including myself, see as toxic.So then what's my alternative? Just let bad faith actors clog up this sub with the laziest, most headache inducing posts known to man? Obviously not, but I am arguing that we've gone too far in the other direction.

5106,Destiny,"Destiny's defence of keeping the crazy in his life is the same as Joe Rogan's defence of weed Okay, I don't want to psychoanalyze Steven, but I did notice this pattern.   Generally, Joe Rogan can use cannabis in a way that keeps him productive and doesn't negatively affect his career, which he equates with 'responsible use'. I mean he does the 'Sober October', so he isn't addicted, right?   I think Steven's view is the same - as long as he keeps bringing crazy people on and survives the shitstorm, he is fine. But arguably in both cases, there is a potential for abuse and things going sideways and taking that thing away can probably make your life better.  However, I do think that the tradeoff for getting these positive things in their life doesn't seem worth it for both of them. And the only way they can see if it's worth it is to actually try completely dropping the thing they wanna keep, but I don't think they will ever do it.  I just think that it's interesting to see how Destiny's defensiveness of his right to have the crazy in his life flares up. Like how he got pretty heated (my assumption, don't know his internal state) at Melina's argument about him having a big ego about it. But she was right - ego is about identity, and Destiny's identity of being this 'unemotional sociopath that is able to see everything in a very cold-blooded way' is super important for him and I doubt he will ever review his stance on that. Especially considering that yeah, his personality makes him super successful in the world of politics. There was even a study that showed that 'dysfunctional/borderline psychopathic' people are overrepresented in the business world, compared to general society, although it showed that having such people in senior management usually reduces profits.

5112,Destiny,"Im bullish on this stock, buy now if you can $DMD1. **Recent shifts in the market have greatly deminished consumer trust.**   The ousting of two very polarizing cast members last week was generally well received by the markets. Dan and Aba stock most notably made huge gains in a very short amount of time. However what we see now is immense growth in a very uncertain envirement. i don't see other orbiter stocks rising to similar levels because consumer trust in the parasocial relationships with orbiters has been greatly decreased.   In adition to that, revelations made by aforementioned former cast members put a shadow on the leadership of the company. In my view, the CEO has shown a lack of understanding for the concerns of his peers but also quite clearly has a problem with cheating. Even though this was expected, we have to remember this is the only reason why the open relationship architecture was chosen in the first place, to avoid this issue. But it seems like the CEO is unable or unwilling to legally and morally oblige to the contract he has signed here. 2. **The companies intransparancy in regards to the situation at hand, and the recent revelations, have, in my opinion, made the scenario of a split likely.**  We have seen a very rough patch in the relationship between CEO and his fiance earlier this year, and it seems, that we now know a little more about the background. What our market researchers see is clearly a pattern of behaviour that is at the very least mistrustful and at most deceiving. Those are big problems in any relationsship and giving that this is an open relationship it could in my view be detrimental. I think that the fiance has lost a good amount of trust in the CEO following recent revalations.3. **""But the green card ohhn ooo""**  Many market researchers argue that the relationship might end, but that in no way shape or form means that the two parties are going to get devorced since there is incentive from at least one party to keep up the legal mariage status. This is clearly a risk, however since the CEOs bridges tend to blow up in the most brutal way, i think this is highly unlikely. If something happens it will be big.4. **STRATEGY:** This is a long play with a decent amount of risk, however with recent revelations its only a matter of time before the markets catch up with the news. So you could also swing trade. However i recommend holding. This is a great stock if you already have a portfolio full of dan and aba stock and want to hedge against another relationship. You could also either short melina stock in adition to buying this one or go long on melina then dump in a few months top. Overall i would recommend to keep your investment to safe options (Dan, Aba) and put a small amount in high risk/high reward plays like this. **THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**",2840,506,0.9902,0.08,0.766,0.154

5144,Destiny,"Destiny vs The Saint And The Sinner observation and current drama The Saint And The Sinner guy is obviously a complete clown, but his view on Destiny as a hypocrite regarding his past statements about NFTs and later being involved in the same scam was a legitimate point about his integrity and consistency. You could see it in his face that Destiny knew he got him good and he was noticeably shook, obviously this specific topic is something Destiny wants to avoid at all cost because there is simply no way he can defend it as anything but engaging in something he knows is a scam for his own benefit. Destiny dodged the entire accusation with a rhetorical win by asking the clown what an NFT is, which turned the entire thing into a meme and everyone just forgot about the NFT scam again.I remember when the NFT thing went down, the tone that Destiny had was obviously that of someone that knew how shameless it was and the words coming out of his mouth with a smirk on his face as he was reading the shill lines given to him was done in such a way as to make the situation into a joke.  Fans of Destiny defend this behavior with ""Destiny said he was a sociopath so it's fine"", but it doesn't really engage with what it says about Destiny and potentially his motivations for the actions he takes.This in mind makes me question what the controversies this year and  the current drama is really about. Is it really just the byproduct of having ""interesting crazy people that he loves"" on his stream? Or is this channel slowly turning into a high IQ person bringing on low IQ and crazy people to actively create drama as it provides an endless supply of content?

5161,Destiny,"Destiny should qualify his statements more when speaking to new audiences especially on ""hot"" topics or personalities Out of all the clips, Lex posted, the one about Joe Rogan, his audience and vaccines went viral.Partial breakdown of the \~first half of the clip&gt;I think there are good conversations to be had about a lot of stuff related to how we handle the coronavirus you know were lockdowns effective was there enough data to support the huge measures we took um you know why didn't we have the option to show I was infected a month ago, why do I need to be vaccinated? why wasn't that option ever a thing in the United States I don't think it was.This is a good way to come off as reasonable as a left leaning person, off the bat willing to analyze and criticize the effectiveness and the logic behind the measures that were implemented.&gt;There are really good questions to be asked there. But all the people asking the questions are also trying to tell you that Ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies are the way to go for everything and the vaccine is evil and it's going to turn you gay like the frogs and it's like Jesus like you cant there's like no place to reasonably criticize from because all of the people that are criticizing aren't doing it with an open mind or you know they're not reading studies or do anything they're saying like ""I do my own research"" which means they listen to whatever the last guy Joe Rogan said and now they're parroting that opinion 100% -easy now -yeah not... well the last guy on Joe Rogan, not Joe Rogan ok? That Robert Malone guy on Joe Rogan got me real fired up. -That's one guest -People see him as like the father of mRNA technology he published one paper okay? -What do you mean people? which people think that? -Joe Rogan fans I get like... I run into these people. I start arguing with this people and they start sending me ""well, what about.."" -I'm a Joe Rogan fan and I appreciate the vaccine -That's good I'm glad you do, but there's definitely..   All that preparing the field thrown in the wind. Destiny's making the point that the discourse is poisoned and there's no good place to have a nuanced conversation, which is a fair point, but then goes on to attack Joe Rogan's (a good friend of Lex) fanbase which completely derails the conversation.    He then mentions Robert Malone which he completely dismisses, which is an absolutely defensible take. Lex is still stuck on pushing back for Joe Rogan and his fanbase. He mentions that Robert Malone was ""one guest"", from his POV he knows pretty well Joe Rogan's controversy and what he went through and Rogan's more recent efforts in balancing out his guest spectrum of views. (one example off the top of my head I know he had 2 episodes on climate change a few months ago and the guests were diametrically opposed on the issue from one episode to the other and he spoke about his reasoning for this) While Lex is hooked on that, Destiny tries to move back the conversation towards ""the guest"" i.e. Robert Malone, attacking his credentials ""he published one paper okay?"". This could've been fine if they continued on this point and went in on Malone's credentials and credibility, but that didn't happen. Destiny should've took his time attacking Malone on this, not for Lex (he already said ""that's one guest"", signaling he has no intention on defending Malone's arguments), but for his audience. As it stands we're left with a snappy giggly short attack on Malone that won't get the chance to be elaborated further for the audience to understand.&gt;\-Sorry, also but you said there's a type there's a type what's the type what's the type of Joe Rogan fan? -Anti-establishment. -I think that's not Joe Rogan that's a that's a general public discourse there's a default anti-establishment on the on the right and the left that's the default easy thing to go to.. -I think Joe Rogan fans are definitely a certain type of anti-establishment though like I could guess the Joe Rogan felt like if I were to do general population versus Joe Rogan fan who do you think is more likely to be anti-vaccine? -Do you have data on this are you just guessing? -Just guessing yeah -I think you are actually judging -I am -I think you're judging because I think you're also, the beautiful thing about podcasting this could be similar streaming is there's a large number of people that just listen, like what what does it mean to be a Joe Rogan fan -I don't think you just listen I think people listen and absorb the information -I would say that Joe Rogan fanbase is as divided in the vaccine as the general public -Gotcha man I'm gonna look for pulling data on that I'm sure somebody's got to have done it out there but.. -No but you're you're basically revealing the fact you have no data you're using your own judgment.. -For sure uh based on how he's had conversations about how his experience with the coronavirus and then based on the guests that have come on that have talked and echoed a lot of like anti-vaxx talking points and been completely unchallenged and then based on statements he's made about like myocarditis and the vaccine and everything as well yeah -So the.. it's the level of Challenge and not that he's doing -well yeah and then what his true positions are and then the types of guests he typically chooses to bring onto talk about the vaccines yeah -okay but that represents somehow a deep anti-establishment feeling versus just the vaccine I mean I've seen the vaccine and other things being a thing that broke people I think the whole of coronavirus that whole one or two years broke a lot of people -there's a lot of emotion and emotion quickly uh solidified into an opinion that almost had nothing to do with like re like thinking through and updating your knowledge and so on you just made up a.. made up your mind -yeah but I think a lot of it comes from that antisocial place like what the vaccine represents the ultimate of establishment it was a huge private company backed by a huge uh public government and there's Fauci and there's Biden and there's Pfizer and there's all these countries locking us up in our homes telling us to do a thing like the vaccine was like the ultimate like submission tool to like show you that the government owns you not only you have to get injected once it's a series and then you got to get boosters and it's like they're trying to keep you under their thumb and it's that's the control um I Feel Like That vaccine became like the ultimate rallying cry between like do you support are you a sellout that is going to believe whatever the government tells the Sheep to take or are you going to be like the guy that stands against the crowd and gets fired from his job and pulls his kids from school because they're not going to let the evil Fauci medicine you know jab them in the arm ...Lex tries to elucidate why Destiny used Joe Rogan's fanbase as an example and what's the type of a Joe Rogan fan. Destiny concisely says anti-establishment, and Lex pushes back and thinks that's actually the default general discourse right now, on the right and on the left. Destiny also pushes back challenging Lex to acknowledge that a Joe Rogan fan is more likely to be anti-vaccine than someone from the general population. Lex asks for data (I think most people even in Lex's audience would agree to Destiny's point here, the caveat about ""a certain type of anti-establishment"" was very well done). Lex accuses Destiny of ""judging"". Destiny doesn't cower away from that. Lex doesn't explicitly say it, but he gives the impression that he's uncomfortable with Destiny using the typical Joe Rogan fan as a strawman/stereotype in his first original statement. Lex paints the picture of a diverse audience for Joe Rogan (""there's a large number of people that just listen"") which implies there's a vocal camp that seizes the discourse while others are less engaged in the public discourse while still being Joe Rogan fans. Destiny doesn't agree, because people listen and absorb, meaning even the less engaged fanbase views should be slanted by that fact. Lex Fridman takes a strong stand and states he believes the Joe Rogan fanbase is as divided on the vaccines as the general population. Destiny disagrees and wishes they could have polling data on that. (again, I think even Lex's audience would agree with Destiny here) When the disagreement is set, Lex enquires on Destiny's judgement that brought him to the conclusion, Destiny promptly responds on what he bases it on. They explore it further. 4 minutes in, the clip continues to other areas in the same topic.The Joe Rogan forced detour and the unfinished Robert Malone take-down were the 2 big things that could've been avoided/handled better. At least that's my takeaway. Lex's a cool dude, it was a good episode. Very unfortunate the defensive trigger happened so early in the topic. Lex was ok, but many in the audience probably remained with the trigger flipped on from then on. Hope for a good showing in the discussion with Mikhaila Peterson also. That'll be interesting.dggL",9100,1609,0.9994,0.058,0.782,0.16

5194,Destiny,"A thought on Lex's issue with language. I got high yesterday and went on a huge thought loop while listening to the podcast. Then I came home and wrote up a huge post trying to flesh out my ideas, but deleted it cause I figured it would get no traction.After thinking about it a little more, here's my best summary. We are biologically and deterministically social animals. Anyone that is too anti-social will never have kids, and remove themselves from the gene pool. Part of that biological determinism is a theory of mind that ascribes our mindstate to others. The idea of social interaction is generally to increase some sense of camaraderie or communality. Through social interaction, we try to group ourselves with others who experience the same dopamine hits from the same stimuli.The problem with otherizing language is that there is a reciprocity between people that makes some jokes okay. Steven talked about him making and receiving comments that never made him feel otherized, but the first time he heard a girl receiving the same handful of woman jokes from every lobby it triggered him. I think when we use some language it otherizes people because there is a distinct lack of reciprocity in the joke, and **that** is what otherizes people. Two people from any group can insult each other on in-group characteristics is because it is implicitly understood that either of them could be the target of the joke under the right conditions. The realization that both people can be targeted reinforces the amount of similarity between them. Because they can both empathize with being the target of the joke, they can calibrate how hurtful they're being.Otherizing jokes lack that empathetic reciprocity. A joke about going back into the kitchen won't feel the same to a man or a woman given our cultural history. The woman can try to find an equivalent, but the fact that she'd have to put in effort in determining if it was just as hurtful/critical/funny/witty would reveal a real-world difference between the two that can't easily be bridged. Two people calling each other retards may be easy to do because both of them have a shared understanding, but that same joke can be otherizing to someone who is or knows someone that could be maliciously targeted and otherized by that word.I'm not calling it a problem or suggesting we ban otherizing language. Lex had a feeling when Steven called people retarded and couldn't quite describe it or why it make him feel uneasy. Hopefully this adds something to that discussion.",2529,428,0.7573,0.086,0.801,0.113

The more immigrants of a certain region/nationality in a given area the greater the chance of better restaurants catering both traditional and quality food from that region; that or a contemporary version catering to the local regions palate.So obviously you get better Korean, Mexican, Cuban, Italian, Cajon, etc. in the US varying region to region than like Indonesian, southern Mediterranean, central to eastern European, etc. food. And so mark down food from regions that are unlikely to be good in the US precisely because of lack of exposure to authentic quality food from those other regions.Side note: Cajon is fascinating as that's a mix of African, Spanish and French heritage.It's hilarious that Destiny said he had a good English breakfast in London.

That is Destinys personnal relationships that shouldnt be brought to light.  Having a sexual relationship with someone that is treated bad by your community ie you  is no where near abbusive just inherently.  I have felt that mrgirl was his friend, but hearing destiny's side of things confirms my suspicsioins.  All their talks theyve had with destiny standing by mrgirl telling his audience that mrgirl is misunderstood and not all the bad things he is called.  A lot of the conversation theyve had in the past destiny points out that he agrees with mrgirl, but mrgirl just goes a tad too extreme.  And losses people.  mrgirl has hurt Destiny which has rightfully so been the reason destiny has done a complete 180 in defending mrgirl to exposing him.  Even without new information.  I cant stand mrgirl crying over being abused by the community.  Like all orbiters are abused just suck it up.  Its destinys community so he can run it however he wants and if he gets into relationships with some ppl there isnt any sexual power dynamic at all just underlyingly inherently.

5310,Destiny,"On using [REDACTED] as opposed to 'dumbfuck' While \[REDACTED\] and 'dumbfuck' are both pointers to idiocy, the former is also very commonly used as a pointer to intellectual disability. While a lower intellect is a common negative trait of those with intellectual disabilities, using intellectual disability itself rather than its trait can be extremely 'otherizing', as Destiny puts it.This 'otherizing' also fuels segregation in the minds of the individuals a part of the practicing communities.A parallel can be drawn in calling someone 'poor' instead. If it were statistically deduced that poor people, perhaps as a result of a lack of access to proper education, displayed the same trait, it is clear to see how damaging common use of this word, used in this way, can be to a community.But can 'dumbfuck' fit in this parallel? It can be argued that, as a class of peoples, dumbfucks do not choose to be so (anti-free will), and a lower intellect is just a negative trait of dumbfucks. I believe the difference lies in unnecessarily **reducing** an entire group of people to a single negative trait. 'Dumbfuck' is synonymous to 'person with lower intellect'. So long as this is the word does not act as a pointer to any other group of people, no group of people is being reduced to idiocy. This makes sense- what harm can come from making a community associate dumbfucks with being dumbfucks?In fact, I do not think the trait has to even be negative. \*insert supporting arguments\*TLDR: I consider a word a detriment to a community when it reduces another community to a single trait.",1590,268,-0.9482,0.142,0.776,0.082

5356,Destiny,Anyone else think Destiny did quite poorly on Lex? He didn‚Äôt really have any impressive arguments or insights on there and just came across as a rambling gamer with not really anything insightful to say. I don‚Äôt think it was well received by his fans as well since not really any big gain in subs from an exposure to such a massive audience.Destiny has definitely come across much better in many other podcasts or panels he‚Äôs been on. I think it‚Äôs because destiny has been out of politics past few months and comes across pretty clueless now.,542,97,0.9328,0.048,0.768,0.185
5357,Destiny,"Petition for Destiny to listen to the people around him When the majority of your ""close friends"", partner, colleagues and community all come to you with the same worry and warning, you should probably listen. Especially considering these are all people who have great respect for you and see you as a very intelligent person. It would be intellectually dishonest to dismiss them. Like if a close friend said to an unhealthy person, ""I think you'd do better with a little exercise"", is the unhealthy person just built different and won't get benefits from exercising? Is the friend in this case just forcing their own biases on this person? Or is there some underlying wisdom they wish you'd recognize or at least consider?It's truly respectable and noble to be as good faith and accommodating as Destiny has been, but he is harming himself, his audience, and the self-centered man-children when he takes on the father-role for adult people. They never get the opportunity to learn, the audience never gets the opportunity to understand how to deal with these people beyond placating their whims and desires, and Destiny is forced to wear kid-gloves for every interaction or he'll be perceived as suddenly abusive. I feel like this is the exact mistake he made with Hasan. Also, while I agree that younger people aren't as developed as older people, the way to catch them up to speed isn't by denying them accountability and granting an excuse for dumb and shitty behavior. None of the criticism is about Destiny's ability to handle these situations. None of it is about him secretly being stressed out or emotional. Most of it isn't even about engaging with interesting (crazy), but *HOW* he engages with it. It's about Destiny engaging in a harmful behavior, to himself and others, and setting an extremely poor example for his audience and those who see him as a role-model. What happened to the meaning, moral and virtue arc? Did he forget about C.S. Lewis? Does he not really care about positively impacting the world? Am I huffing copium? Is Destiny really as hedonistic and sociopathic as he's currently selling himself as? Does he really see himself as non-human and beyond human needs or weaknesses?",2208,373,-0.8992,0.151,0.702,0.147

5383,Destiny,"What is this debate tactic called? I have noticed some online debaters using a debate tactic that I am tentatively going to call ""honeypotting"". How this works is that you make a point during a debate that is unrelated to the conversation that you are currently having that sounds outrageous and you know that your opponent will call you out on. However, while this point may sound outrageous and indefensible, it is actually an argument that you know that you can win. Basically, you are baiting your debate opponent to challenge you on a topic that you know more about so that you can get an easy W and decrease your opponents confidence.Here is an example of ""honeypotting"": Suppose you are having a debate about climate change. Now suppose that mid conversation, you casually mention that it is morally permissible to have sex with dogs. You opponent immediately challenges you on this claim because  they believe that it is easy to argue that sex with dogs is immoral. However, little do they know that you are far more well versed in the dog fucking discourse than they are and you destroy them on this point. You bring up the fact that your opponent is a hypocrite because they consume animal products and therefore pay people to rape animals via artificial insemination in factory farms. Your debate opponent then realizes he has no way to attack ""dog fucking"" without conceding that eating meat is immoral and he is forced admit that its ok to fuck your dog.Although the dog fucking question has nothing to do with climate change, the purpose of bringing up the topic is to make your opponent look bad in the eyes of their audience because they were destroyed in an argument that they were confident that they could win. This will also decrease the confidence of your debate opponent and will make them nervous which increases the chances of them slipping up later in the climate change debate.Does anyone know what ""honeypotting"" is actually called?",1959,338,-0.9616,0.131,0.784,0.085

It's not worth it to cover some drama for a few days if it means a month of no orbiting and having dgg flairs removed is a permanent hit to prestige in the community.

And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a streamer. When I feel like it. So...you asked.  steven, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the drama destroying your community is that everyone in your orbit, you included, use content to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to talk to crazies.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping drama and abuse allegations. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might get cancelled. It's just work.

As someone who is pretty desensitized I was shocked to hear it, it felt different but the reason why was probably because it wasn't something I heard someone say in a long time. IBasically my point is, when you avoid using certain words, when someone actually says it, there's an added shock factor, it seems more potent therefore having more power.So you could say not saying certain words makes them feel less diluted thus actually empowering people that actually want to use them in a malicious way.The r word was never something I ever thought was a big deal and it seems like people are giving this word way too much power.

The more advanced books, in my opinion, repeat what the lower level books say, but in more words and details. If you‚Äôre interested in therapeutic models, I would recommend the books written by creators of the models in general, ie for IFS Richard Schwartz books, for DBT written Marsha linahan or whatever is recommended by dbt community, for marital work the gottman method books written by the gottmans, you get the idea.For a well rounded view of psychology, I would recommend learning about family systems, behavioral therapies like CBT and/or DBT and some Carl Rogers and person centered therapies, and then whatever else sounds cool.

5562,Destiny,"Lex Fridman interview felt like a missed opportunity Typical padding at the start - Destiny fan, long time lurker... been through all of the dramas and I'm still here, still a believer. Just the other day I was saying to my partner - enough tea! The Lex Fridman interview was a moment for Steven to gain massive amounts of traction beyond the DGG sphere and I think instead of a tactical nuke going off it was a modest box of TNT. The overall tone was ""okay"" but I'd like to view this from the external. Imagine you're someone who has never heard of Destiny, none of his well conceived views, none of his sexy antics and this is your first exposure. Would this be the kind of interview that you would share with friends? Was there a standout clip that you would pass on to someone to convince them to give Steven your attention?The metrics I am looking at to further support this point is both at home and away. Socialblade has not seen a spike of new subscribers (typical 1000 new per day) and on this very subreddit discussion barely circles the interview beyond a celebratory pat on the back.(To me) tonally it felt less like a conventional interview with an intellectual and more like a friend with a large audience doing a favor for another friend with a smaller audience. Though I must admit that their chemistry was fantastic, I think it felt more casual and less thought provoking. Just to wrap up my own thoughts and I'd love to hear those of others, after listening to the entire interview there wasn't a single moment that I'd pinpoint and clip for a perspective fan, ""this is the reason you need to give this guy more attention, listen to what he says right here about this thing."" The few times that it felt like he was about to gain some momentum, Lex pushed back by asking if he had any actual data and the answer was - honestly, no.  Not to say that the interview was a bad one, it just felt like the opportunity could have yielded higher levels of conscription. TL;DR - the Lex Fridman interview was good for us of DGG to watch but probably did little to indoctrinate the masses.",2096,385,0.9971,0.045,0.75,0.205

So as a long time viewer of Destiny I was intrigued.It was the fourth or fifth viewer call in he took today (the one that said he felt like Eren Jager) and they shortly spoke about how the anime really has nothing insightful to say about genocide or the modes of government or any of that stuff. It was a short conversation, but I think Destiny made really clear how he felt about the show.So to quickly summarize Destiny's point, he said that while the anime is fun and simple, it doesn't have any perspective about how a government should be run or the moral implications about the genocide of a whole population.Now, here is the thing: GENOCIDE is a theme that actually is more relevant to our time than probably ever before. Except maybe the third reich, which the show leans on in some way I think. But I doubt the Nazis ever watched Attack On Titan.Destiny said that he ENJOYED watching Attack On Titan, even though it never really engages with the subject of genocide or the purity of a population ever!The viewer stated that he almost felt like Erin Jaeger, but in the real world it's actually about CAPITALISM - so, for anyone not knowing - Erin Jeager is a character in Attack On Titan. While you might think he has a minor role, some might identify strongly with him to a point they draw parallels to the real world.The anime is about the plots of Eren Yaeger and the old military!Destiny actually admitted that the show gets wild, but in his perspective remains very simple in how there are GOOD GUYS and BAD GUYS!Now, the anime doesn't spend a lot of time exploring the real ins and outs about what it would mean to live in a fascistic empire was his point. BUT, now here's my perspective: Eran Yeager could actually be seen as identification figure for someone who watched the anime.Not me for sure, I never watched Attack On Titan, but maybe I actually will some time. It really sounds like a fun show, even though it isn't a deep dive into fascism.That's all.",2171,391,0.805,0.077,0.828,0.094

5599,Destiny,"Suggestion: DGG Community Town Halls and More Direct Community Engagement I would like to pitch the idea of something like monthly town halls with the chat/reddit/discord communities instead of considering the most upvoted reddit memes and comments, chat's emotes and emails as the general sentiment of the community. Allow a reddit post and discord channel to consolidate and elaborate on their thoughts and bring some of those people on stream to address these issues. With the way things are going, it's becoming too easy for the average person to look at the reddit and not think ""damn these guys hate this person"" *when in reality we have serious issues with some of these people and our concerns aren't being addressed*. Engaging with the community more directly might help curb overall resentment toward people who we might be wrong about, especially since *SOME* of these people provably hinder the important conversations we want to listen to. Lav is a great example of this as, in my individual opinion, barely 1/4th of her contribution to any given conversation is constructive and the other 3/4ths of her contributions are actively deconstructive (destructive feels too strong for how much I'm generalizing).A lot of people don't like Lav, but writing us all off as Anti-Lav/lAv DeRaNgMeNt SyNdRoMe/misogynistic only addresses the extreme end of the people who dislike her and helps bolster the false narrative that DGG is ""crazy,"" especially when Destiny says almost exactly this on stream for everyone to clip and circlejerk over.I'm not saying anything could have been changed or must be changed in the future, but I am saying that if Destiny wants genuine non-schizo feedback, I believe he could take steps to cut through the memes and anger and get to the root of the issues that we as a whole believe have merit. People who get their feelings hurt because we're mean claim Destiny should have more control over the reddit and discord to stop us, but maybe just communicating with us could be better than that. We shouldn't have control over him ever, but we could be better understood.TLDR: Constructive community feedback across reddit and discord could be addressed more often to better the community as a whole, while still not controlling us/letting us control him.I will not elaborate further. 4thot arm me.

5642,Destiny,"Lav drama is boring, let's talk about how BADLY Destiny did on the Lex podcast Upon watching, the Lex podcast I really enjoyed it, and thought it was an honest back and forth between two rational people with differing views. No stupid bad faith nonsense, and very fun and conversational. I enjoyed seeing Lex get a bit more personal and trolly with Destiny. The comments on the main video were also quite positive.Then I read the clip channel and you could see the free thinking \*centrists\* Destiny railed against in the podcast come out and it was clear that Destiny lost a lot of people he probably could have made inroads with.Some of the choice quotes (all of which are highly upvoted):MAGA republicans&gt;I appreciate that Lex will literally interview anyone from anywhere along the political spectrum.  I particularly appreciate he allowed Destiny to illuminate exactly how abjectly hypocritical and ignorant is the thinking of the LeftJoe Rogan Fans&gt; I love how Lex has grown into one of the most reasonable voices on the Internet and holds his guests accountable for their hyperbolic BS, regardless of ‚Äúside‚Äù.  Good job, Lex! Thank you! There's lots more, you can find by just reading through the comments, but you get the idea  Basically, I think Destiny underestimated ~~how fucking dumb~~ the different world view, a decent chunk of Lex's audience  has and did a worse job than normal of speaking to them.  On red pill podcasts Destiny will be very kind and gentle in explaining to people who treat women like objects why maybe women are actually pretty neat and fun and worth talking to. On this podcast Destiny bluntly stated that most Joe Rogan fans believe stupid things in large part because of who Joe Rogan platforms and how Joe Rogan presents information. This was ~~too much for the fans tiny minds~~ too incompatible for many of Lex's audience world view and caused them to stop listening to Destiny.It's just overall disappointing and not at all surprising people claiming to be all sides free thinkers immediately turn their brain off the moment they hear someone presenting a different world view. It sucks that it seems like Destiny needs to treat most people like wayward children and can't even say basic things like ""there's a difference between dems saying 2016 was tainted and republicans saying 2020 was stolen"", but yeah, what ya gonna do.  tldr; Liked Lex, but many of his fans have centrist brain worms and Destiny probably would have needed to layer up on kids gloves to reach them.",2522,427,0.9916,0.083,0.75,0.167

From my limited knowledge of Ana and the situation she was a lady Destiny had relations with and she turned out to be a crazy stalker. And recently he has said that she is finally chill. In my mind the implication is the crazy lady has finally left me alone and now I can get back to my life. And I feel this is the narrative he was pushing. When Mr \[Let me finish\] brought up they are currently sexting it felt like a manipulation. Now idc if Destiny shares any of his personal information. But this feels like something he would call out if someone else did it. Publicly denouncing someone but in private sexting them and wondering why they are still so crazy.  If there are a bunch of stray cats around the neighborhood and you ask a neighbor do they know why. And they say they don't. Only for you to find out they have feeding them the greatest cat food this here side of the Mississippi, it feels like you were lied to.  Now I don't agree with whatever Mr \[Let me finish\] is doing. But after this point its hard to believe anything Destiny says about his relationships with these women. Because how many of them does he feel certain information holds no baring but that actually changes the entire perspective on the situation.

5664,Destiny,"Retroactively justifying your behaviour One of the most manipulative things that I think Max, and now Lav, do is using someones response to a statement or event in oder to retroactively prove a pointThe most direct example is from Mr Girl arguing with destiny around the Fuentes arc, then accusing destiny of being ""abnormally defensive"", because of how long they spent arguing around the Fuentes arc. Basically starting a fire and then pointing to that fire as evidence.The worst, but also most transparent uses of this tactic are when Mr Girl or Lav will say something triggering, and then use that triggered reaction as evidence that the claim they made is valid. ""Doesn't the fact that you're reacting this way say something about you?"" Obviously we have the Ana situation with Lav, where she brings Ana up in a convo and then when Destiny gets angry, then Mr Girl uses that anger as evidence to strengthen the point he's making about orbiter mistreatment. Then, last night with Erudite, Lav implies that Destiny calling Mr Girl a rapsist on the previous day's stream somewhat validates what Max is doing, ignoring the fact that Max had started making his accusations before that stream even started. Do something shitty to someone, they lash out, and then you point to their reaction as the reason you were right to do that shitty thing.It's also incredible to frame this whole situation as ""they just need to talk and make up"" when one side is not only accusing the other of sexual misconduct/abuse, but also desperately trying to find any evidence they can to prove make that accusation stick Retroactively.",1614,274,-0.9894,0.149,0.832,0.019

Ever since i got into this open one-sided relationship with Destiny/Steven, it seems like he never reaches out to me or attempts to be in touch with me in any way.           It seems like he is willing to give sheep-like and psychopathic people more attention than someone who respects and looks up to him. I understand how there can be no content associating with me because i dont have drama with him but he can at least be more engaging than he has been with me.      My lack of boundaries when it comes to conversations is very slim and is primarily why I'd be willing to share almost anything with him on a personal level.     At this point i know him enough to know we are very similar but where i lack in i wish to gain with his guidance. I cant be a big or small streamer because of my illness and i have no shot at getting his attention otherwise it seems. I could be his first long lasting good friendship this year that transcends past this ""cant keep a new friend made in 2022"" trend. But he is playing games it seems      Also im 24 like Lav but I'm biracial [black/white]. Destiny doesnt really influence me the way i wish because where he stands on things tend to be the same as me.      I found destiny on youtube like 3 months ago and he hasn't changed my mind on anything which is why im so intrigued and interested in engaging in a non-dramatic conversation with him. I could never conceive a thought or a reason to start drama or to harm him by slandering what he stands for or what his opinions are just to get noticed by him.      So the result is hoping he sees this and I'd assume i have a very slim to no chance of this being seen by him because at this point its more of a cope for myself so i could say at least i tried and reached out.

Unequivocally doing a moral action to save victims.Mr Girl foots the bill perfectly. His mind is capable of going down this path if it comes to it.

He's not acquired this mindstate yet but that's not the point.

5697,Destiny,"Why Saint the Sinner is right about there being no gay gene but reaches the wrong conclusion. When he speaks about there being no gay gene it's implicitly understood that there is a heterosexual gene to the average listener.  There is no heterosexual gene so to claim homosexuality isn't biological when you lack evidence of a heterosexual gene makes no sense by this method . Homosexuality was normalized throughout the Greco-Roman period and the edo period 1600 - 1800  . It wasn't considered abnormal but just a normal urge to have . In fact , Greco-Roman period considered pederasty to be the highest form of love which is something we find absolutely disgusting today . Saint and sinner is a religious man yet the average age of consummation during biblical times was 11-13 for a Jewish girl.  Even Mary is said to be 11 to 13 by biblical scholars . God didn't give them the meno  - don't have sex with underage girls who lack agency? Another reason I'm an atheist not following that nonsense.  That's the religion he subscribes to so he needs to defend that if you want to demonize Steven for his sexuality.  Steven being homosexual is a consensual act while the religion he subscribes to condones the consummation of underage girls. Before the 20th century not a single Bible had the word homosexuality in it but rather ""men who lay with men "" Why ? Because sexuality wasn't who you were but  something you did . We only have a few cases of feral children,  i.e children severely neglected socially . They don't display a sexuality by sex nor even a gender.  Often times they are indifferent to sex , one feral child choked someone to the realization of the examiners that he was aroused  . The sample size is small but it's  amazing how our DNA seemingly means absolutely nothing without socialization.  Not to be offensive but feral children don't resemble what we think a human should behave like . Though only a few , it serves to be evidence against people like rollo tomassi ( A Pioneer of modern Red pill )  who created a ""praxeology"" as he calls it by evolutionary psychology which is a pseudoscience ; By an unfalsifiable hypothesis our actions are guided by our evolutionary past.",2197,386,-0.9134,0.107,0.815,0.078

5716,Destiny,"Skinnyphobia is worse than Fatphobia Several streams ago, the topic of fatphobia came up with Destiny, Low Tier God, I think Pxie... and a few other people I cant remember.At one point, one of the girls brought up that skinnyphobia is a problem and just as bad. It was dismissed somewhat quickly but I want to bring attention to this since its something Im very passinate about. It effects not just women but the men attracted to this body type.In fact, I think its WORSE than Fatphobia in a lot of ways.1. **People defend THICC attraction, but not STICC attraction**On the male side, whenever I express attraction to this body type, there will ALWAYS be a thicc chaser that feels the need to say ""Naaaah Im more into girls with meat on their bones"". If someone likes some thicc girl, its always cool. But if I like a STICC, everyone needs to throw in their 2 cents that they arent into that. Its like everyone needs to explain that they disapprove, without outright saying it.On the female side, whenever I go into the comments section of a skinny girl, there is ALWAYS someone that says ""someone get this girl a sandwhich!"" Often times the girl isnt even undereating, she just has a fast metabolism. Its downright shaming this body type. Online, you rarely see this in reverse anymore. If you attack a thicc body type, you'll get smoked. But attacking a STICC girl seems A-OK.**2. Pressures girls to get implants**Because people never shut up about their distaste/indifference for STICCs, it pressures girls to get booby and booty implants. Which sucks. This body type is already somewhat niche with growing obesity in America, but now the girls that do have this body type end up just up modifying themselves. Leaving even less for STICC enjoyers. You guys are ruining the diversity out there.**3. Calling this body type pedophilia**This makes the problem a thousand times worse, because STICC women want to be viewed as grown adult women, not young girls. I think this is the main reason people feel the need to voice their distaste for STICCs, to not appear pedophilic. Its extremely destructive for women pysche, it discourages men from liking this body type, and probably the main driver to pressure women to get implants.Not everyone needs to have the same body, if everyone was attracted to the same type, we'd all would look exactly the same. These are all problems that come with Skinnyphobia, while Fatphobia doesnt have to deal with. No one shames a guy for liking a thick girls, but us skinny enjoyers are CONSTANTLY under fire.",2542,439,-0.9615,0.134,0.768,0.098

5747,Destiny,"EFFORT POST: Steven needs to tailor his speech more to the type of audience he's interacting with This year has been great overall.A lot of growth for the channel and the community, lots of new people. With that, some issues arise.\-Steven needs to to have all his ducks in a row when it comes to how he presents his past, his life, or the opinions he has to new people\-The best showings this year may have been in the redpill arc. The debate with Myron was great and both did extremely well.\-The patience he had with Sneako was commendable, the fact that even Sneako's audience agreed on multiple occasions that Steven was right speaks for itselfThe concerns:\-There's this thing that Steven does on stream where he semi-rambles about a topic, giving a rushed rant about a certain topic and his complaints about something related to it. That is fine for DGG. That is not fine when you have another audience listening to you. Similar to this when a new public person asks a question about a topic he covered before, he acts excited (for the lack of a better word, he's transmitting he has strong beliefs about that topic, like he already gets semi-triggered by how that panned out or was generally presented by other people) then he totally speedruns over it any%. This is bad. Easiest example is losing an IRL audience over the Covid stuff when he said horse de-wormer. He knows those people shut their brains in that very moment and shouldn't have said it, but it probably feels so beaten to death that it's annoying and boring to throw a better structured methaphorical wall of verbal text at them, therefore he speedruns any%. \-Over time it feels like there's a carelessness relating to ""stupid"" topics or topics related to more famous persons. examples: the multiple wrong storytelling of Lauren Southern boat flare ~~gun~~ incident, Jordan Peterson stuff (he was always highly critical of him, not just after the benzos, even if he acknowledged his psychology/self-improvement takes are ok), Joe Rogan(Rogan tries to ""balance"" guests that he invites on the show to represent both sides since his move to spotify and the covid controversy, you should make the audience aware that you know that). The unhinged vitriol he's shown multiple times for Kyle Kulinski unprovoked (that doesn't mean without merit), the Peterson strawman voice, he brought this edited meme clip as real, twice at a several months distance. First time he found out from chat it's edited, the second time it happened months later he took offense when a chatter asked him if he was bad faith or if he forgot he brought it up before and banned them. To a certain extent he's a performer, and like a performer he should be able to perform to a certain level to satisfy the audience and capture new people.These new drama frogs are not domesticated, and Max stumbled in with this stupid drama at the perfect time to fuck their brains up. The last thing you want is your opinions you spewed so many times so eloquently to be misconstrued because you're now bored and trying to remember what's the fastest version to say that what you said the last time you had to remember what you had to remember when you said it the first time. The Lex convo was good, a big part of it was great and part was messy. Some topics he covered so many times so fucking well were botched or poorly presented for new viewers. On the bad words part he didn't even get into the public/private use argument. They looped for half an hour on the r-word, but that's more on Lex than Destiny tbf. He said in the convo with Lex that when he's having a convo with another content creator he knows he's not only speaking to that content creator but their audience also, so I know he knows this, but he should really consider that more, because everytime I hear ""oh, man \*giggles\*"" I know he's gonna go in on some topic with some quick remarks under-breath which are gonna confuse new audiences. That's fine if he gets the chance to elaborate further but he may not always get the chance to do so, he's not the one controlling the flow of the conversation, so why not say it proper the first time, the audience is listening, you may not have thair ear later, you may even throw the ""oh man"" first but compose yourself no jokes and speak plainly.I remember the Covid talks after he was full to the brim with research shit, it was fucking glorious. Coming up with bullet points from those convos to new people without laying out the foundation and context is rhetorically iffy.Some of this may seem obvious, some unnecessary, and some completely wrong, but considering the spheres we're bumping at the moment, I feel like it was important, even if only 5% of this feedback he'll find useful.TL;DR: You can't speedrun petting a cat.",4774,843,-0.7062,0.092,0.811,0.097

From the first time I heard him on steam I could hear the condescending tone being used to make others feel terrible about themselves even if their transgression was not only extremely light, but harmless if simply moved on from. An example of this would be when Mr. ----- gets extremely hung up on the slightest of details and implications, believing that he alone knows truths that no one else can see.

""I have no impulse control, nothing online feels real to me"" Going out of your way to make insane accusations about people is entirely intentional, she knows what she's doing, she knows what she's saying, she just doesn't want to take responsibility.. I don't buy into all this insane shit being ""understandable"" because she was ""manipulated"" and ""misogyny in the community"" The fact that after all this she see's max as her ""dad"" makes me SICK. I've had close family members that are just like mrgirl/lav and they are destructive to the people and communities around them, and the emotional and psychological damage they do should not be underestimated. I understand Steven is fully detached and entirely internally driven to the point that his emotional needs are nonexistent but if he wants to have long lasting relationships and friendships with people then he needs to take responsibility for the damage he's causing to the people in his life, Just because HE can handle these people doesn't mean it doesn't seriously effect the people around him.

5767,Destiny,"So I realize this might sound harsh but I honestly think a simple way to figure out who should be a frequent guest on stream should be based on how that person defines themselves. With this community being so large and diverse, it would almost be impossible to know which criticism of what guest are actually valid and worth taking into account. Now since thats always going to be an issue with each new guest, we should instead just base it off how that person sees themselves. So any person that comes on stream and seems to relish in the idea that they are mentally unwell (Diagnosed or self diagnosed) is someone that more than likely will express the type of traits that tend to be problematic. Someone who* Uses their mental issues as a defend for their actions.* Consistently sees themselves as the victim in all interactions* Can never admit when they are in the wrong/incorrect regardless of the evidence in front of them.* Isnt actively seeking some form of help for the issues they identify with* Tends to always blame othersNow im not saying these signs should be the end-all, be-all of who can or cant come on stream, but it does seem to make a compelling argument when you notice that every problematic orbitor tends to have one or more of these problematic traits. I do understand that this may seem wrong to some, but personally i think its far worse for us AND that person, if we continuously use their mental state for our own enjoyment. Even with all that being said, i do understand that these types of guest do make for interesting content and that no one is forcing them to be on stream. So I think as long as that person is being responsible and actively seeking some form of mental help and STILL wants to come on, then fuck it.

I do believe him when he says he does well with girls, which makes this much stranger. If it isn't a matter of being hard up, there seem to be two possibilities. One, he has some sort of compulsion. Or two, he kind of has an addiction to this type of person. (See: Lav, Chaery)This woman has a lot of issues, which BEFORE he could say he didn't know about. But he does know about them now, and knows that she is fixated on him. Is it appropriate, knowing those things, to engage with her intimately?There's another issue. This video is like a spotlight on why this is fucked up. It's timestamped to the relevant portion, which in light of what's going on takes on a different character. Ana refers to sexting from Destiny around the time when she makes the infamous ""You called me Princess"" remark, which she was mocked for. Why is this a healthy, or fair, thing to do to this girl?

I Should start by saying I might not have full context. I watch some but not all of Mr Girls content and some but not all of Destinys content. I will also say I definitely think Mr Girl is in the wrong in the recent drama. But in Destiny's recent video he said he steal manned Mr girl making pro r\*pe videos. If even at the time he thought they were pro r\*pe videos the why would he steal man them? I completely understand Destiny being upset about the recent drama but it kind of feels like he suddenly think Mr Girls is an abusive r\*pist when before he was friends with him and would argue that his videos were misunderstood. So it kind of feels like Destiny suddenly changed his position on these videos because he is mad at Mr Girl or destiny has been intentionally defending someone who he thinks genuinely is pro r\*pe and abusive but just did not care before. Neither of which seems good.

5831,Destiny,"Is this a good apology letter to a judge and police officer I accept my conduct on the 1st of april 2020 for committing this offence, and the seriousness of the matter. I do believe in society the use of drugs is a net negative to not only us as a society but as an individual. But I do believe the consequences of our actions do mould us to be better, and do better. For that i thank you for finding me on the night of 1st of april 2020, and I understand that this is a serious offence which I will never repeat..This letter is foremost an apology not to only you, but to society, and  to law enforcement. This includes the paramedics who had assisted me, too you and your other colleagues with treating me with nothing but respect during our interaction. At the time of the offence i was 20 years of age, i do believe it was a transitional period of my life. I was a drug addict, it was beginning of covid, everyone was living at home, i could no longer hide my drug addiction, i was within a group of friends who wanted neither growth for me but had been victim to the same root expression of drug addiction, escapism, nihilism, and bitterness for where our actions had led us. The consequence of  drugs are mostly hidden in a myriad of hedonism, but really it is a an empty bottle i was anxious, depressed, day after day having my family see high everyday,  due to the enjoyment no longer being unsustainable but having turned into being a slave, but now a survivour to the constriction drugs do place on you to question whether am i alive or am i living. Apart from my mental health, the root issue was I failed university. I was working a job I hated in a warehouse treated like a number, that could be dropped on a whim. For some context this is not an excuse, just a reality of the situation of the time. In fact, I had never taken substance for fun. I did have tough upbringing with a schizophrenic father, and cousin who was a terrorist with the same last name. Drug use was my normal growing up, I neither condoned it but it was a fact, i was unable to process my wrongs because that‚Äôs all i knew. But after the fact i do still hold accountability, and growth which my present does illustrate about me.Since then I have tried therapy for three months, it was not enough but due to making countless reckless financial decisions the debt disabled me to continue till this day. So instead i have been working with my doctor Suzanne located in Tullamarine speaking with honesty, and treatment to not only fix my mental health, give advice, but hold me accountable to being sober, and staying sober. I had further faced the wrath of my actions having been kicked out of home for a year learning the reality of the world nearly facing homlessness, neither my parents condoned  my actions or enabled me. Since then I have learnt numerous life skills from learning to drive manual, cook,clean, wash my clothes, and learnt how to study again. As of now I'm learning how to swim. This hiccup in my life, challenged me on a deep psychological, and philosophical level questioning, day after day what is my purpose, who am i, what am i, and who do i want to become. I read Socrates, Plato, Dostosevsky, read on existentialism, objectivism, absurdism, learnt myself to an extant without drugs, and the libertarian approach it curates.I finished my diploma, and currently working towards getting my bachelors of IT, then  hopefully transferring into computer science with my credited subject. With the work of my doctor I became sober, got a job in banking and finance with drastic improvements with my mental health and those around me who I do love.  I mended countless relationships, but lost many for me to grow. In fact i do have work friends but having numerous people to call friends in the past i have none now.It‚Äôs not because of my extreme nature of being quite enigmatic, well that partly, and my sober friends moving on from my life due to addiction, which I support.  But on the other hand,  since our last time we had been in contact. My cousin had stolen my phone, and exposed my bi-sexuality. Having come from a socially conservative community, I had been outcasted, bullied and humiliated, and was physically assaulted. So I do suffer a lot of loneliness, depression  and anxiety. I hope I can keep this one mistake to be left in the past with a diversion program working with the prosecution, but still hold accountability on my end. Having had the realisation that the world can be beautiful, but having seen how dark it can be to an extent, I do wish to help others in some form one day with drug addiction, which is one of my dreams. So I do believe generosity is the best apology, it‚Äôs to give back, and begin therapy once in the financial position i will. For the time being I will donate 150 to my aunty back in africa facing the worst drought in 40 years in somalia, where countless amounts of people are dying in somalia. I will donate 150 to Turning point, a drug addiction organisation, By november 18th.",5029,917,-0.4974,0.124,0.757,0.12

This is a comment I wrote didn't feel like rewording it for this post.Holy crap. Lav is completely unhinged. She takes zero accountability and finds excuses for everything. She even stated herself she isn't looking to change, she obviously just wants everyone to wave away any mistakes she makes. She downplays the mistakes she makes as if they weren't that bad or they weren't really her fault. When that fails however she tries to explain that whatever she did or said to/about the person that they deserved it. I hope Destiny thinks critically on this. Best case scenario Lav continues on this path and doesn't harm anyone. Worst case scenario she pulls a Mr.Redacted or worse. But it seems to me that if pushed against a wall she will in fact take that route. It is very unsafe for Destiny to keep her around.I hope the people in Destiny's ear are aware of this and I hope he is aware of this.People thought Mr.Redacted was innocent and just ""really trying his best"" that's a huge error. Mr.Redacted was always like this and simply revealed his true colors. He was ALWAYS like this. Destiny didn't ""turn him into this"".Lav is the same way. Stop trying to explain away her words and what she's saying, her mannerisms, and her manipulations. I'm not saying she is a mastermind but she is clearly aware of what she is doing. If mastermind is 10 and a ignorant clumsy fool is 1 (weird scale I know), Lav is without a doubt a 7. You could argue a 6 probably. I will reiterate it again. Lav is very aware of what she is doing, but she is planning on doing it and weaseling her way out of whatever consequences show up.",1782,322,0.9846,0.109,0.712,0.179

5950,Destiny,"Covid Origin Solved (for real this time, I did the research) I used to watch Destiny play SC2, saw him on Lex and he made a statement about being sure covid came from the wet market. I don't think having really strong feelings one way or the other when is warranted at this time. I am going to steal man both sides, and also call out what I think are the biggest weakness for each side. If you think either are a conspiracy, then you haven't given the other side the time it deserves. Real science can be questioned by anyone, science gets stronger by questions not weaker. It is wrong to assume you need a degree in one of the relevant fields to ask a question, you might need one to answer it though. Full disclosure I currently lean a bit toward lab leak but have switched sides a few times. Read what is below knowing my bias. Also know I share Destiny's views on how dumb the Dr Fauci witch hunt is. I am not trying to debate this issue, just make sure people are aware of both sides as too many people have written off the other side.# Why it mattersPandemics kill millions of people and have a huge impact on society. It is imperative that we prevent as many future pandemics possible due to the long term costs on humanity. Adding up the death and sickness it causes the world's population over the entire time the virus circulates, makes pandemics extremely costly. It is clear we need to prevent future pandemics. Currently we have labs around the world that monitor and research virus, looking for future potential pandemics and trying to figure out how to prevent them or how to develop vaccines. If that work caused a pandemic, then we need to re-evaluate if we should continue it, or how we should continue it. If it had nothing to do with it, then maybe if pandemic prevention research was given more money or oversight it could have prevented covid-19.The answer to this question has huge implications for many researchers across the globe and has implications for how governments spend money going forward.# Natural Origin## Scientific SupportI will not be sharing circumstantial evidence as we have real papers that have influenced my thinking. If there is something major I am missing please comment with it.First major paper claiming to know origin: The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 | Nature Medicine. This paper was taken by many to be definitive for rebuking the lab leak and labeling it a conspiracy. As a result it was not seriously considered for many months.Second major paper:  The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was the early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic | Science, I believe this is the one Density was citing with Lex. This paper is part of a pair of papers. One does some complex statistical analysis on where samples were found in the wet market after it was shut down and shows a heat map linking it to where animals known to be potential hosts of COVID-19 were kept. Here is one of the authors discussing the findings: The third paper:  The molecular epidemiology of multiple zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 | Science. This paper shows that two early linages of the virus, A and B. It concludes that A evolved into B or the other way and instead both have an unknown parent. This unknown parent is assumed to be from nature because the spillover date from the lab due does not give enough time for the lab virus to evolve into both linages A and B.## Short steal man:Almost every virus in circulation today come from natural spill over. We have had new viruses introduced to the world from wet markets in China, and other places live animals are sold. Occam's Razor suggests natural origin is more likely. It has taken years to find the natural reservoir in the past so not finding one yet isn't proof of lab leak. We have near enough relatives in nature that it is not definitive that it came from a lab and could have instead evolved in an unknown host for some time before spilling over to people.## Weaknesses:The proximal origin paper authors had conflicts of interest and that major claims in the paper, such as it not having any marks of laboratory construct turned out to be false. The state of the art virus manipulation is able to edit genetic code without leaving behind clear markers. I don't think it is being cited anymore as a pro natural origin paper.Limitations for the Huanan Seafood/Zoonotic papers are not as clear cut as the first paper, though I don't think it is quite a death knell. One of the assumptions in both papers is that the virus started late October. If it started sooner, say August, than the A and B lineage paper needs to rework evolution probabilities with a longer time to evolve. This would weaken the assertion that this couldn't have evolved from a lab leak as there is more time to evolve. This also means the samples that were analyzed from the wet market were older and gives more time for a human to have given the virus to an animal. These criticisms do not strengthen the lab leak argument, instead just weakens these papers. Evidence that it was circulating before October is very strong:  Researchers find coronavirus was circulating in Italy earlier than thought | Reuters. Also China ‚Äòbegan stockpiling PPE months before Covid outbreak‚Äô (telegraph.co.uk), not a fan of this source so treating this as circumstantial evidence that China knew something was going on in September. This puts the spill over/lab leak more likely in August, again this doesn't strengthen lab leak, instead it weakens the two papers supporting natural origin. Others will also discredit the first paper saying that the data they used was given to them by China and we know it was a subset of the data. They suspect that data was held back that would have shown more ties to WIV instead of the wet market. Weight cannot be given to either argument based on missing data, instead all the data would need to be added and re-evaluated and new conclusions drawn as more data could strengthen or weaken either theory. Another shortcoming is that they expected a person infected from the lab to have also infected people on the way to the wet market, which would cause multiple epicenters within Wuhan, which is not seen. This same logic applied to their own story causes more problems though. The closest known relatives for the virus are in bats not found near Wuhan. This means they somehow were transported 100's of miles to Wuhan without causing multiple simultaneous outbreaks along the transportation routes. This is a much bigger problem for natural origin than lab leak. This is a known effect when other animals cause spill over events.The experts for viruses often are funded through grants where they go and collect and sometimes modify natural viruses. If this is shown to be a lab leak this would most likely cut a large amount of funding as well as make the research they do today much more difficult. ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it."" This introduces a bias that is hard to account for and I believe is part of the reason this question has gotten so political. This doesn't add any weight to lab leak, but it is a bias that needs to be accounted for. This could be the whole reason Lab Leak was called a conspiracy at the start and really is a very un-scientific stance.# Lab Leak## Circumstantial SupportThere are no scientific papers that I know of that support lab leak. Instead, lab leak is based more on looking at what how the Chinese government responded, genetics of the virus and how those in the US with conflicts of interest have answered/not answered questions.First lab leak depends on it being possible:  Escaped Viruses (armscontrolcenter.org). This wouldn't be the first virus to escape, what would make this unique is that our tools for virus manipulation are much better than they were in the past. The counter Occam's Razor in this case is that we have never had these tools so looking at past events doesn't give a clear picture.Second it requires WIV to not use the best safety practices, and to be working on closely related viruses: Bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Like Coronavirus WIV1 Encodes an Extra Accessory Protein, ORFX, Involved in Modulation of the Host Immune Response - PMC (nih.gov). In this paper they mention research done on bats as BSL2.  Basics of Biosafety Level 2 | Office of Clinical and Research Safety (vumc.org), BLS2 is not sufficient for aerosol pathogens. WIV also was working with live bats:  The Wuhan Institute of Virology Kept Live Bats Within Its Walls | National Review, this is in direct contradiction to what was said early on by the lead WHO investigator.WIV took databases offline that had previously been accessable:  (PDF) An investigation into the WIV databases that were taken offline (researchgate.net). If WIV had been working on COVID-19 and it spilled then it would have been in the database that was taken offline, if they were not working on it then it wouldn't be.Investigators were mislead or not answered while doing investigations into the origin:  Jeffrey Sachs: Lessons from the COVID Commission, Lab Leak Questions, and Nord Stream ‚Äî #21 - YouTube (long watch but worth it). Grants have been released as part of FOIA requests that suggest doing the exact research that would have lead to covid-19:  Leaked Grant Proposal Details High-Risk Coronavirus Research (theintercept.com). This means research of the kind that could have started COVID-19 was at least being explored. It is not a smoking gun but does squash any arguments saying it cannot be done or that it wouldn't.## Short steal man:China as well as those in the US who had influence on research at WIV lied and covered up what research was being done in the time leading up the COVID-19. The initial spread of COVID-19 doesn't match other spillover events, and research grants had been proposed that could have lead to COVID-19. The virus itself has no obvious natural relatives that it could have evolved from in such a short time without leaving traces in wild animals.## Weaknesses:There are no papers detailing the work for creating COVID-19 in a lab, when viruses are created, they are cataloged and have papers released later if they are of note, COVID-19 is of note. In the case that it did come from a lab that would mean the people who did the work are conspiring to keep it a secret. WIV had knowledge of how viruses transmit to people and would have been careful in the cases it was dealing with a new unknown pathogen. Not a single piece of direct evidence exists to support lab leak. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.# Scientific Investigations:This question has been looked into by scientist and they concluded we don't have the evidence at this point to conclude either way. This was The Lancet COVID-19 Commission, you can watch them report their findings here: # Reasonable ConclusionsBoth sides have gotten too political and are not dealing with the question of what to do about it. Lab leak has people calling for Fauci's head, while natural origin supports call every person questioning if it came from a lab anti-science. Really both sides should be calling for wet markets to be abolished. Wet markets pose too much of a risk for starting pandemics and we need better public health standards across the world. Both sides should be calling for better lab regulations. How can a lab working on genetically modified pathogens know how risky they will be for people and take the right precautions? We cannot predict virus interactions with humans at this point so all new pathogens should be treated as very high risk. The Obama era definition and ban on gain of function should be re-instated, or we need a safety standard that eliminates the risk of a leak. If you are not changes that mitigate both risks then you are too politically motivated to listen to.## Other considerations:Senate report: Report An Analysis of the Origins of COVID-19 (senate.gov). Parts of it are valid criticism, while other parts are not. It is not a scientific paper, more a collection of circumstantial evidence. This is clearly politically motivated and bias.Fauci email coverup: With the emails that have been released from Dr. Fauci in the early pandemic there is clearly an early acceptance that both scenarios are plausible with lab leak later being rejected as most likely. I have not seen anything supporting that this was an intentional coverup, and the latest batch of emails seem to support it. Brining a case against Fauci seems to be a waste of time and just a witch hunt, it would set a bad precedent for future holders of his office.Masks/Vaccines: The origin has nothing to do with masks/vaccines. Try to untie these three issues as they are all separate scientific questions, and it is very easy to let the team you are on for one of these issues drive how you think about the other two.**TLDR:** We don't have definitive proof of natural origin or lab leak. Both are valid hypotheses, neither one is a conspiracy. It is unscientific to say otherwise at this time. Be open to where the data leads.",13132,2277,-0.9971,0.11,0.807,0.082

On Wikipedia, it means you have anti-jewish sentiments. In dictionaries, it means that you have negative sentiments to anyone who speaks Semitic  languages like Hebrew and Arabic, and other ancient or obscure languages that Jewish people often spoke/speak. So, the word basically means the hatred of anyone who is tangentially related to Jewish people through language. Not sure that's what most people mean by anti-semetic. Anyone else curious why a better word hasn't been made after thousands of years of people hating Jewish people instead of the broader technical category of Semitic people? Bonus: I learned this when I watched an interview where someone called Malcom X an anti-semite and he replied with how he loves Arabs. Did not know the dude disliked Jewish people enough to not deny it on TV.

Ironically enough, I believe the response itself contained several statistical inaccuracies:To briefly contextualise the relevant medical study, the primary variable of interest is the [odds ratio] ( (OR); for brevity, an OR of 1 means the treatment has no effect. Also, when the study talks about an adjusted OR (aOR), the ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù part just means a statistical procedure was done, which isn‚Äôt relevant to this post.**1: The result is insignificant, plain and simple.**&gt;""cloth masks do nothing according to this study"" is also wrong. That study found a 56% reduction in transmission rate for cloth masks, AS THEY EXPLICITLY MENTIONED ON THE VERY ARTICLE YOU LINKED.As per the study, cloth masks had an aOR of 0.44 with a 95% CI of 0.17-1.17. Since the null hypothesis, that cloth masks don‚Äôt affect the transmission, i.e. aOR = 1, is within the confidence interval, the result is insignificant (at that CI) and shouldn‚Äôt factor into your thinking. This is because if you continue drawing samples from the population, you may well get a result that suggests that the treatment has no effect! I‚Äôll end this part with an excerpt from a PubMed article on statistical significance:&gt;[If the result was insignificant] the researcher would conclude the study did not reach statistical significance as the p-value is equal to or greater than the pre-specified alpha. **The research would then not be able to reject the null hypothesis.** Recall, again, that the null hypothesis here would be ""transmission is unaffected by cloth masks"".**2: This is a poor understanding of statistical significance.**&gt;The reason why they say that this is not statistically relevant is because of the effect size and the confidence interval. The CI is so wide, because of the nature of the data observed (small sample size), that it makes the result not statistically significant, as in, their data is not clear enough to be certain that the true reduction is close enough to 56% for that number to be relevant, so further research is needed. But what it does NOT mean, is that the actual reduction in transmission rate for wearing cloth masks was found to be insignificant (as in this is not proof that masks don't work, like you said it was).Wide CIs and small sample sizes aren‚Äôt why this result is insignificant, and it‚Äôs a bad way to think about why results are insignificant. First, the study had a sample size of 534, which isn't small. Secondly, ""wide CIs"" is a strange way to put things. For higher confidence levels (95% -&gt; 99% and so forth), the confidence intervals must necessarily widen. If they don't widen to the extent that they include the null hypothesis, you're more sure of the direction of the effect, that is to say, its significance.There are plenty of studies with 'small' sample sizes (as u/MetalPerfect has defined them) that have significant results and ""wide CIs"". Here‚Äôs a psychology paper for illustration.**In conclusion**To be sure, an insignificant result neither disproves the null hypothesis nor the alternate hypothesis; instead, it makes the more reserved claim that it cannot serve as evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis at the given level of confidence. With that in mind, the cloth mask portion of  this CDC graphic is definitely misleading.Overall, I think the discussion could do with toning down the vitriolic hostility&gt;You are either intentionally misrepresenting this scientific article or you simply do not have the statistical knowledge to read a basic scientific paper. Either way, stop pretending that your opinion is based in science. It's based in your feelings.and be more open to some epistemic humility.&gt;You losers need to learn some fucking science&gt;You're not skeptics, you're morons.",3965,633,-0.8428,0.088,0.843,0.07

If you ask a theist "" if you were deluded would you want to know ? "" And they yes I would like to know then it's in their best interest to attempt. People undermine how religion may alter the way you view the world. Staying in a abusive relationship because you believe it's God ordained , feeling you aren't good enough because you believe your good works get you into heaven , feeling like you are worthless after having sex because sex has been labeled such a taboo act outside of marriage , and so on but the most basic foundational crime is to rob people of what they could have been doing otherwise. I want to be clear , if you are deluded then you can't consent to the proposition prescriptions.There is no consent when deluded For example, a muslim girl wears her hijab to be modest believing she is pleasing Allah and escaping a hell.She may wear it in the hot sun believing she will ultimately be rewarded which even leads to rickets disproportionately in muslim communities and also depriving her of consent , and acts she could have done otherwise .This is not consent but coercion. I find it absolutely insane that it's normalized to threaten children with a hell, mutilate boys/girls calling it circumcision, praising a book that EXPLICITLY says to kill men who lay with men as if it that was EVER morally permissible and for us to say that it  should be legal. If I made up a religion today , demanded people  act a certain way by some God or go to hell starting with the children, and said a characteristic like sexuality ( people of dark skin deserve death ) in a book I claim from God I would be condemned.

Hi. I'm new here so don't kill me... yet... I'm not a racerealist but i have a hard time answering the question why ""black people"" as categorized in a lot of studies always show that this group, in western countries are disproportionately represented in violent crime, in pretty much every western (white majority) country. If it was only in US countries it would make sense to blame US systematic racism due to US history, but when the results are repeatable in every western country that doesnt make senseMaybe it does make sense to call it a black cultural problem since most of the gangster hiphop culture is directly aimed at black ppl in western countries?It doesnt make sense to call it a problem of racism since why would whites only be racist against blacks? jewish ppl who share the same looks as other middle easterners have massively different results where jewish ppl in general i think outperform any host people within 5 years of moving to a new country...Could it be explained by poverty? blacks in general flee from war/extreme poverty to western EU countries, so do middle easterners alot of the time, jewish ppl usually dont...  For a racerealist this is usually their slamdunk since its repeatable throughout western countries that differ in culture, systemic racism and so on... and they would ask, if its not race related why is it repeatable everywhere in every scenario where they move?my guess is our answer would be, they usually move from extrem poverty into the lowest strata of western white societies and they usually show the same stats as that poorer strata in western countries? so its more socioeconomical than race related...But ye, thats my question, dont kill me.",2024,341,-0.995,0.175,0.777,0.048

I don't know the data on this specifically so I can't say this as a fact but there are my thoughts.Religious people's belief in god is usually the assumption way before any questionening.  In judaism for example there is a book called the "" ***Kuzari***, full title ***Book of Refutation and Proof on Behalf of the Despised Religion""***  which has one main point : to prove god and the jewish god after it.  This book isn't trying to explore or to ask, ""is there a god? if there is a god ,which god is the right one?"" it assumes the jewish god is the correct one, and simply tries to argue for it, never doubting it.  The experience god is usually an emotional experience , the prayer, the confessions to a priest, the forgiving and the guilt.   Religion is believed by people because of it's emotional impact, and then any time there is a doubt people find/invent excuses  for why god this exist despite it not making as much sense or as being convincing.  (see "" why did god not create a world so perfect that no evil could exist in it"") etc.  This is the exact same processes as a conspiracy brain.   You believe something about the vaccines, or the landing on the moon and invent explanations every time there is doubt.

I think I may be posted two comments to that subreddit one particular that may have led me to being banned which was an article written by a liberal that was talking about how the statistics behind far right politically motivated violent crime may be skewed due to the nature of gathering those statistics. With that said it wasn't advocating for violence or denying the reality of their claims but I was interested in seeing a take on the article. I was just curious if anyone else have had similar experiences with Hassan's community or of that community is even worth exploring.,997,180,-0.7801,0.132,0.771,0.097

6056,Destiny,"Having watched Destiny's streams for the past several months, I've now realized... How the FUCK my parents must've felt when watching me play my games back in middle and high school, and the pure state of absolutely CONFUSION and perplexed FUCKERY going on in my brain. Usually I just have the stream on in the background, but I started to actually watch the gameplay and I feel like a schizophrenic tier 4 sub trying to grasp what the FUCK is going on watching this mf play Factorio. Seriously, what the hell is this game? Is it even real, or is this all a fever dream? At first glance it seems like some iteration of Rollercoaster Tycoon but instead of rollercoasters he's building factories, except for the fact that Rollercoaster Tycoon is actually a fun game, and at no point does it seem like Destiny is having any fun building these factories. It's like someone is perpetually off-screen forcing him at gunpoint to play this game. Blink twice if you need help, Tiny. Also, if the point of the game is to build factories, how the fuck does the lore explain having to fight random ass bugs? Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? What kind of ego do these bugs have to try to attack a GOD damn LONE MAN with a SPACESHIP that also FOR SOME REASON has a spider mech suit??? Why is there a spider mech suit?? Is this Pacific Rim? Is the main character Doc Ock from Spider-Man?? The more I try to understand this game, the less it makes sense.

6064,Destiny,Are there any studies that show (or don't show) strong increases in human trafficking related to the legalization/normalization of porn? I think everyone agrees there there's a strong correlation between societies that tolerate porn and reduced rates of rape (correlation isn't causation tho). But this post isn't about this specific point (although any further insight would be appreciated). It's about human sex trafficking and its increase or decrease related to the existence (or non-existence) of the porn industry in general.My position is that sex trafficking has always existed and that by making it legal at least now we've got some control over it. But maybe I'm coping. Maybe human trafficking numbers have increased since the legalization of porn. Maybe it's not the legalization in itself but the availability and ease of access of it through the internet and tube sites. Like some form of commodification or normalization of something that used to be pretty niche.I honestly don't know plus I'm not finding much information about this on google (other than religious propaganda). Is there any data out there about the porn industry and how it relates (or doesn't relate) to human trafficking?(asking for a friend of course),1237,197,0.9707,0.03,0.84,0.13

I'm watching the VOD right now and he repeats it almost word for word on the live stream here.You might feel the same about Tim, here is his Wiki if you care but tl;dr he does musical comedy, does film, theater and gets awards. He did a speech called ""9 Life Lessons"" at UWA which I really liked and so seems Adam.The excerpt goes:&gt;Three: Remember it‚Äôs all luck. You are lucky to be here. You are incalculably lucky to be born and incredibly lucky to be brought up by a nice family who encouraged you to go to uni. Or if you were born into a horrible family that‚Äôs unlucky and you have my sympathy but you are still lucky. Lucky that you happen to be made of the sort of DNA that went on to make the sort of brain which when placed in a horrible child environment would make decisions that meant you ended up eventually graduated uni. Well done you for dragging yourself up by your shoelaces. But you were lucky. You didn‚Äôt create the bit of you that dragged you up.

He's recently been on a media tour promoting his book even being interviewed by Youtubers. His recent book is called ""**Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do about It**"" so definitely an overlap with the internet manosphere which will definitely lead to an interesting discussion between him and Destiny. Most of his recent media has been about this newer book however I'm slightly more interested in his older book.His older book ""**Dream Hoarders: How the American Upper Middle Class is Leaving Everyone Else in the Dust, Why that Is a Problem, and What to Do about It**"" would be a great discussion as well. We always see the internet left blame the top 0.01 percent and billionaires for rising inequality but Richard makes the case that there is a growing separation between the top 20% ""Upper middle class"" and everyone else that reduces overall social mobility. I think politically any policies that would effectively reduce this ""opportunity hoarding"" would be incredibly unpopular but also would be a great discussion between Destiny and Richard.I think I saw Twitter hate on him before so as always there is a chance leftist twitter will say Destiny is interviewing a misogynistic academic.I don't have any suggestions for questions that Destiny should ask but I'm sure the rest of ya'll would have good question and discussion suggestions.His ",1627,269,0.9813,0.036,0.814,0.149

6109,Destiny,"Destiny said he's gonna be less charitable after the drama BS, this shouldn't seep in to serious debates. So he decided to be less charitable to individuals similar to MrGirl, Annalicia and whoever may fall into saying some really sus statements.I think that's completely fair and beneficial.With that said, I think he should be extra careful for that attitude not to transfer off to his other types of content, specifically serious debates or high-profile showings.What I absolutely hated years ago, and still have some problems with (to a lesser extent) now, is the high level of condescension that some political figures or internet personalities seem to have. It's a similar kind of aversion that black individuals have over woke white liberals that treat them like retarded ""uninformed"" kids, or simply put giving the vibe of having a superiority complex. There's a fine line between confidence and arrogance and Destiny threads that line a lot, and I can see the danger of a new viewer having a problem with that. Watching today's appearance on the NoJumper, I didn't really like how the Balenciaga discussion as a whole, I'm not saying he made bad arguments, but I'm saying it looks bad pushing back and risk to appear dismissive when you're not familiar with the new/fine details. Fortunately it was followed up with a great discussion on the trans issues where he outlined his positions very well.There were points in the NoJumper talk where he rattled off some reference to some well-known political/philosophy term and you could see it went right over the guests's heads. Need more GIGACHAD energy to take your time and explain it properly, you're there to talk so talk more and make everything in your statement clear....What I wanted to say is that streamer-man should light a camp fire in this dark souls of internet shithousery. Recover back some of that research HP he had 1 year ago, sharpening that optics sword again, and being more tactical and consistent when he attacks those new mobs. Reign in the new souls gathered along the way and be ready to catch more. TL;DR: Destiny should be more like Richard Wolfe.

6127,Destiny,"The Theory behind Black Israelite Hebrews and the possible origin of the Ye/Irving Controversies Hi, Black American here who was just as confused about the Ye/Irving controversies and black anti-Semitism as much as the rest of you. I'll get to my thoughts on how these situations should have been later. For now, this is merely about the Black Israelite beliefs, because this is very likely what both of those men have sourced their beliefs from. In fact, that's definitely the case of Kyrie Irving because the film he shared called ""Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America"" is propaganda for this exact ideology.So this theory came about after the emancipation of slaves in the US by a fairly radical group of Black Christians in 1886. Under this belief system, Black people were part, if not the entirety, of the lost tribes of Israel. When Israel was destroyed (722 BC), the tribes scattered throughout Africa, and their descendant would be sold into slavery  and become the African diaspora of today (Essentially me and the vast majority of black people in North and South America). In fact, the Atlantic slave trade is believed to be prophesized by Deuteronomy 28:68:&gt;And the LORD will bring you back in ships to Egypt, a journey that I promised that you should never make again; and there you shall offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.Before I get into the huge inaccuracies, keep in mind that this was created during a time when Black Americans were almost completely disconnected from their homeland and only had Christianity to go off of, preached by White Americans who could've had similar views on Jews. With a desperate search for identity and origin story, I can see why these ideas gained attention. Now as for these ideas, they are quite wacky. This already falls apart when you realize that in the story of Jacob (of whom the lost tribes derive from) the tribes started from modern-day Israel to Southern Lebanon and were exiled to modern Syria and Iran. That's far smaller than scattering throughout West Africa, let alone the entire continent. For the sake of argument, we'll pretend this is untrue. The big problem is what I alluded to in the title. Contrary to popular belief, Africa is very ethnically diverse. Israel is located in the Middle East, which is a part of Northern Africa. The African Diaspora in North, Central, and South America mostly originated from West Africa and some pockets of South Africa. Those are VERY culturally different areas of the continent. It was also almost 2300 years between the biblical destruction of Israel and the Atlantic Slave Trade. There's no trace of Israelite culture in West Africa. This would also have to ignore the Sub-Saharan trade routes between West Africa and North Africa that were established around 700 AD, which included slavery. They would have to be present in at least West Africa for over two millennia  and be relatively unknown and left alone before they can be traded in the Atlanta Slave Trade.You can see the inherent problem with this unfold. This is essentially culture appropriation + self-insert fanfiction, which is a shared trait with these black distortions on established religions and cultures. Its not about adopting the actual beliefs, customs, and rituals of Judaism, but rather writing a story for our people that both gives us pride and rationalizes our suffering. Because so much of our history revolves around being at the bottom of a very cruel power structure for generations, resentment of anyone different and higher up isn't difficult to come by. Combine all of this, with the traditional anti-Semite rhetoric, and the fact that Jewish people have a lot of representation in industries that African Americans have seen as the best avenues of success for a very longtime and the industries are naturally predatory/scammy results in the the two controversies that have reinvigorated the JQ debate today.Now its difficult for me to say what should've happened to Kanye. I don't think he should've been deplatformed. However, he as a major influencer lost business partners that were contractual allowed to terminate their deals. Your image and reputation is everything when selling a personal brand and businesses are allowed to have second-thoughts when you do things a fraction as drastic as what Kanye did. Anyone calling companies willingly withdrawing from business relationships censoring or cancelling is taking things too far. While Kanye does talk about Black independence and wealth creation (something that is very old as far as discourse in the black community goes), he very clearly insinuates that the Jewish community conspires against him personally in many aspects of his life and other artists. Him speaking about Jews as a monolith and refusing to name specific people who he has conflict with is good proof of that. Frankly, I get being careful, but I hate his defenders acting anything less than ""Mr. \[REDACTED\] confesses to raping someone on camera"" levels of transparency means we can't assume anything out of what he says. Kanye seems like a lost cause for now.Kyrie is a little different. I do think he got pushed a little too hard, and in a way that gives strength to anti-Semitic fervor  rather than weaken it. I actually think the Destiny route of having a public conversation with someone very knowlegable on Jewish culture/history could've worked out here. It would be a discussion where Kyrie would have to act in good faith or even some people that would agree could be steered away. There will always be the crazies who will pull any conspiracy theory out of their ass to say any effort to counter their beliefs is invalid, but you can't save them all.",5758,963,-0.9866,0.106,0.819,0.075

When redpill dumbfucks like Tate or Sneako use Islam as a shield for their idiotic and misogynistic rhetoric it should be obvious that these people don't know the first thing about the religion, they're not Muslim and they're only using it as a defense to their horrible takes. When Sneako says ""this is how it is in Islam, this is said in the Quran"" I can understand many of you, being non Muslim may believe that what they're saying is true but it's far from it. The type of lifestyle redpillers brag about, fucking a bunch of hoes etc is looked down upon in Islam and so when these redpillers do quote Islam everywhere they can as a defense I see alot of destiny's chat saying shit like ""Islam is a misogynistic religion"" etc and it's hurtful as it's far from the truth. Islam emphasizes the importance of women regularly and tells Muslims to treat women with love and care. Another issue I had with destiny was with the Israel Palestine situation where he was watching a lex friedman, Ben Shapiro interview where destiny was hard defending the state of Israel wherever he could, but where a chatter mentioned the plight of Palestinians all he could say was ""well it's a complicated situation"" and that's it. Palestinians are slaughtered on a daily basis in Israel and while the world usually doesn't care and turns a blind eye, it is sad to see destiny defending it, whether unwillingly or not. To end I'm just going to say that destiny said ""I feel like I'm the only person on the internet who feels like they have a responsibility over their fanbase"" and I feel like this is extremely hypocritical as by spreading islamophobic rhetoric your community is in turn, internalizes it. I feel like Muslims tend to get the short end of the stick regularly and it's justified far too often, this needs to stop, hopefully the community grows and does better.",2129,376,0.9822,0.081,0.764,0.155

6145,Destiny,"You losers need to learn some fucking science I am sick and tired of seeing dumbfucks everywhere misquote science when they don't understand shit about what they're reading. It's even more sickening when it's happening here, in my home community, my safe space from all the lunacy everywhere else. That's right, I'm calling out a dgga. This guy, in a post on our sub says:&gt; Mask mandates(especially considering there isn‚Äôt a single mask mandate anywhere in the US that distinguishes between cloth masks which do nothing and the masks that actually help), lockdowns, vaccine mandates are all really dumb policies that shouldn‚Äôt be advocated for. The claim that cloth masks do nothing is absolutely wrong. But he goes on to defend this statement by quoting the CDC. He also links to his previous comment which says basically the same thing. He's linking to this CDC article where he quotes this:&gt;Wearing an N95/KN95 respirator (aOR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05‚Äì0.64) or wearing a surgical mask (aOR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.13¬≠‚Äì0.90) was associated with lower adjusted odds of a positive test result compared with not wearing a mask (Table 3). Wearing a cloth mask (aOR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.17‚Äì1.17) was associated with lower adjusted odds of a positive test compared with never wearing a face covering but was not statistically significant. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what statistical significance means, and the only reason you're latching onto that statement is because you think it validates the opinion you already believed in regardless of what science says. When you say ""according to studies, there is not a statistically significant difference in transmission rates for cloth masks"" this is NOT the same as when you say ""cloth masks do not make a significant difference in transmission rates"".Let's break it down.""according to studies"" is wrong, that's according to ONE study. ""cloth masks do nothing according to this study"" is also wrong. That study found a 56% reduction in transmission rate for cloth masks, AS THEY EXPLICITLY MENTIONED ON THE VERY ARTICLE YOU LINKED. The reason why they say that this is not statistically relevant is because of the effect size and the confidence interval. The CI is so wide, because of the nature of the data observed, that it makes the result not statistically significant, as in, their data is not clear enough to be certain that the true reduction is close enough to 56% for that number to be relevant, so further research is needed. But what it does NOT mean, is that the actual reduction in transmission rate for wearing cloth masks was found to be insignificant. You are either intentionally misrepresenting this scientific article or you simply do not have the statistical knowledge to read a basic scientific paper. Either way, stop pretending that your opinion is based in science. It's based in your feelings. As for whether cloth masks do reduce the transmission rate, late 2020 studies conclude that they do and likely about as well as surgical masks. More info on this CDC article.In conclusion, I do not disagree that we're done with lockdowns, and done with masking except for inside hospitals, maybe retirement homes and maybe for vulnerable people. I do agree that some of the messaging was damaging or improper, and that covid ""dead enders"" as this guy is calling them, are cringe. But what's even more cringe is you fucking losers misquoting science and doing much more damage than the CDC or any lockdown ever could as you go around perpetrating misinformation. You're not skeptics, you're morons.",3570,596,-0.7629,0.095,0.82,0.085

There's peer reviewed evidence about the consequences of broadcasting public health advice, and Trump was freelancing like it had never occurred to him that someone had thought about this before.And then on the alt-media side, it may not always be the main talking point but there's always an element of ""they're acting in unison"" when the conspiratorially minded discuss public health officials and the mainstream media. Of course they're acting in unison. They're educated on the topic and there's consensus. And you're being ignored because it's clear you're not educated.At least that's what I thought. It wasn't until ""responsibility for your platform"" argument came up that it occurred to me that this is an article of faith, alongside things like small government, gun mysticism and abortion, that conservative alt media are unable to grapple with on account of needing to get paid doing things that they don't want to be held responsible for.Does this ring true?

For instance Raya and the last dragon bombed, but they were using it more as a demonstration of combining all of the technologies they've made over the last several years. It's clear when Disney wants to make a movie succeed. They'll spend money on it's advertising. A lot of money. They spent basically none on this one.* Disney has been trying to make Disney+ be the main location of all new releases, and this movie is on there. I would not be surprised if they made a ton of money on ticket sales at home, since all of the money goes to them instead of theaters. Additionally the small boost in subscriptions.* Disney does not expect to make money on movies in theaters. Their two biggest sources of revenue are Disney, Theme parks, and products (like toys). A movie about an explorer family seems to just be a ploy for more unique attractions at the theme parks even if it is a good movie.I think there is no reason to think this movie did what Disney did not expect because they didn't spend money advertising it, and know people will watch it eventually",1334,242,0.948,0.027,0.888,0.085

It goes without saying that some moderation is necessary for the function of any platform. However, Elon's stated beliefs concerning moderation are more in line with Destiny's and much of this community's. Twitter has been fairly aggressive in it's de-platforming of many individuals for ideological reasons, meaning the reason for de-platforming comes from what the message of a person banned was. It seems that loosening Twitter's moderation policies are good for speech in general. Others have cited Elon's layoffs of Twitter employees. However, many tech companies are laying off employees right now and have received nowhere near the backlash. Additionally, Twitter has never been profitable. Aren't layoffs necessary? Why is there such strong and vitriolic backlash to an unprofitable company reducing its overhead? What do you expect Elon to do?

6254,Destiny,"Has Amouranth changed since the break up? This is mainly a response to the criticism destiny has got for calling out Amouranth recently. The 3 arguments I have seen on the subreddit are: She said her husband was forcing her to stream for long hours, only stream hot tub/sexual stuff, and stay at home to stream (so no irl streams). Now she streams for less hours, streams more gaming/less sexual content, and she has done more irl. So overall she has been consistent with her complaints.After going through Amouranth stream stats, I would like to share my thoughts.First of all, Amouranth really hasn‚Äôt streamed for less hours. After looking through the 42 days since the incident and the 42 days before, she only streamed 60 hours less (only 15% less than her 397 hours the previous 42 days). Not only did Amouranth take a 5 day break because of the incident lowering the hours, her average stream length was 12.5hrs  (2 hours longer than the previous 42 days). We can also see in the past 42 days she has had 3 streams that have had the longest duration in over a year.The second point seems to be true. Before, she only had about 10% of streams that were games (not including just dance). Now it‚Äôs a little over 40%. Even so, she could have still been in the hot tub while playing so it‚Äôs hard to say if it‚Äôs not comer content or sponsored content. Overall I would say it‚Äôs true that she is playing more games, but is it less sexual?The final point is a bit more difficult to gauge because twitch con happened the week before the incident which was about 40 hours of irl content. In the past 42 days there has been around 38hr of full irl streams not sure if she irl streams during her at home streams so I can only go by full irl streams). I can‚Äôt definitely say if she has done more irl after so this is inconclusive.In conclusion, has Amouranth changed since the break up? Not really. She still streams for super long hours, still most of her content is sexual, and (at least for the 42 days before and after) has a similar amount of irl streams hours.I am a schizo poster and I regret everything.",2103,387,0.3222,0.046,0.905,0.049

6260,Destiny,"Responsibility to your audience Re: Shapiro's claim and Destiny's response starting here: ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm one of the only people on the internet that feels like you have a responsibility to your audience.‚Äù I understand Destiny‚Äôs beef with this point. I get triggered by online political commentators who are unwilling to complete a thought, who will say that Trump can inspire riots and coups but deny that influencers actually, you know, influence thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. It‚Äôs frustrating, to say the least. But I don‚Äôt think Destiny‚Äôs response really gets at the meat of Shapiro‚Äôs comment. I don‚Äôt think that Shapiro is disagreeing with the idea that you have a responsibility to your audience. But if we‚Äôre attempting to develop a code of personal conduct vs what we hold people publicly accountable for, which seem like distinct things, we have to be able to parse somehow. So, for example: on one hand, we may not want to hold the \[surviving?\] Beatles responsible for Charles Manson and his acolytes and those who have been inspired by his race war rhetoric, regardless of whether or not he drew wild inspiration from Helter Skelter/The White Album. We may, on the other hand, want to hold real radical agitators like Richard Spencer responsible for things like Charlottesville. The very fact that we have to distinguish between these things (or any other examples we want to pull) suggests that the existence of person X who claims Y pundit as inspiration for Z violent act is not, on its own, sufficient evidence for us to condemn Y or attribute Z violent act causally to Y‚Äôs rhetoric. Destiny says, half joking, that he would stop making certain types of jokes if someone claimed they committed an act of violence because of jokes he made. That seems like the responsible thing to do, but if, god forbid, someone did commit an act of violence because of Destiny‚Äôs jokes about Yasuo mains, I doubt he would be jumping to take responsibility for that act. He might stop making those jokes in light of the incident, which would be a prudent thing to do, but he (and I) would deny a causal link between an unwell person‚Äôs violence and his obvious jokes. Destiny goes on to say that ‚Äúa lot of this violence is expressly political in nature.‚Äù Of course it is. But the political nature of that violence doesn‚Äôt give us license to attribute responsibility to any pundit that the violent actor may have been a fan of, right? We are having wider cultural, political, and scholarly conversations about targeted acts of violence, ‚Äústochastic terrorism,‚Äù etc. Part of that conversation hinges on who we can point a finger at and say ‚Äúthere! That person inspired an act of terroristic violence, and deserves social/political/legal condemnation accordingly!‚Äù So of COURSE we think creators/pundits have a responsibility to their audience. The question is what sort of responsibility? Do we, as Shapiro suggests, only attribute direct responsibility when a creator/pundit explicitly calls for violence (however we determine that)? Or do we, as Destiny jokingly suggests, attribute direct responsibility when someone does something bad based on a joke you made last week?",3175,529,-0.9943,0.186,0.684,0.13

I am seeking brave Daliban soldiers who are big fans of DnD and have free time on Sundays to join a 5th Edition West Marches Campaign I created and just finalized.  **Some Background:** I started crafting this world and idea after hanging out in DGG chat and YouTube chat during Destiny's DnD games, seeing how many people there actually enjoy the show but don't seem to play any of the games themselves. I decided to start up a discord server where I would host DnD games weekly on Sundays, streamed on twitch, in a persistent world where player choices would have effects long lasting and game changing.**What is West Marches?** It is a style of DnD campaign that is focused less on a regular party and more on a community aspect: the parties that play every week change based on player availability and week reservation. Right now I am only running games on Sundays as it's my only avaliable day, but that might change in the future. My goal is to aim for 4 hours for game sessions, starting at 3 PM EST at the earliest and 6 PM EST at the latest. **How this works**: a player who wants to play on a particular Sunday will either join with the party group that has been building to play in that session if there is a free spot, or they will start a party group if one doesn't exist for that particular Sunday for others to join. **If you are interested in joining the server either as a player or are just curious and want to hang out in the discord to talk dnd and other tabletop experiences, leave a comment here and I will provide you a link to the server with all the game specifics!****Campaign details:** A decade prior, a Cataclysmic event took place in the Kingdom of Egiondon. A Fog Bank that stretch from horizon to horizon and hundreds of feet tall rolled across the land, engulfing and warping anything it touched, racing across with the screams of countless tortured souls. The Baron of these lands constructed a shelter due to some early warning from a Seer that managed to save around 100 of the Barony's citizens, although countless more were lost to the Fog's Overwhelming Presence. Now that there is signs that this deadly Fog seems to be getting lighter across the land, brave volunteers are beginning to venture out into the lands to see what happened to the civilization left behind.",2407,431,0.9689,0.071,0.808,0.121

When Zherka was calling \[REDACTED\] a \[REDACTED\] because of that ""movie review"", I immediately brushed it off like always. Don't get me wrong, I was laughing, but in the back of my head I always think, ""oh, these guys don't get it, \[REDACTED\]'s not really a \[REDACTED\], he was making a broader point about society, the roles that little girls get shoved into, that teaches them that their value lies in their appearance and promiscuity. When \[REDACTED\] says they're \[REDACTED\], he is talking about the fact the fundamental roles that they are trying to inhabit are designed to elicit that type of reaction---he's using himself as a guidepost to illustrate the cracks in the system.""But I didn't immediately realize just how unbelievably charitable that was for a guy I don't really know. Yeah, he's pointing out a problem, but this isn't just a problem that ""society"" has, its a problem that's actively contributed to by, funded by, and propagated by people who sexualize kids. A reaction like, ""these girls are \[REDACTED\]."" Probably shouldn't engender a feeling or a thought like, ""wow these actors/directors are doing a great job, their sexualization of kids was so realistic that it kinda worked.""

What if he's legit just some creepy dude that wants to put his feelings out there, nailing himself like christ to the cross, dying for the sin of being a human being born into this world... But being human means to recognize our flaws, to grow and flourish in a society that works for as many as possible. If \[REDACTED\] is physically incapable of this growth and change to address whatever predilection he may have felt in that moment, then the message he was preaching was hollow in the first place, since that's the recognition and change that is vital to addressing the issues that movie was trying to illustrate (or maybe the movies garabage at trynna do that too, i have no idea). This made me see him in a completely different light, I was thinking for a while that NAAHH, destiny was capping about calling him a \[REDACTED\], on god frfrYodie.. Gang..It just hit me, that if I honestly try to reevaluate my assumptions based on his current actions, not only is a change like that possible, but I felt it.. I can't look at him now without feeling like he's a creep, because, honestly, I think I gave him way too much leeway in the first place..Help me out boiis, I've been hitting the penjamin way too hard and this all feels like a fever dream right now.

Do people actually not remember anything from before 2022 or are they gaslighting? re: ""they said the vaccines would permanently stop anyone from getting covid"" I feel like I'm going crazy in that I'm getting more and more annoyed at vaccine debates the further and further away from the heart of the pandemic we get. Most arguments made by vaccine skeptics are now taking this tact of ""now it's self evident that that 'they' lied about the vaccines because they originally said that the vaccines would confer permanent sterilizing immunity, and because that didn't happen, and because people still catch Covid after being vaccinated, it's just obvious that it's a sham."" I remember first noticing this line of thinking when Joe Rogan did his apology video back in early 2022 or whenever that was, where he said ""it used to be considered misinformation to say the vaccinated could catch and spread Covid,"" but now I see this shit *everywhere.*It wasn't ever even slightly controversial to state that the vaccinated were vulnerable to breakthrough infections, even in early 2021 when the vaccines were at their most efficacious. This isn't hard to prove. There are tons of contemporaneous accounts of the mainstream discourse from that time period of early 2021 that are easily find-able that show tons of discussion around breakthrough infections was going on back then. Even before the vaccines came out, the FDA openly said the vaccine could be as little as 50% effective and they'd still approve it for use.To be fair, the original series of vaccines were shown in real world data to be 90%+ effective against infection against the pre-Delta strains. But there was plenty of talk about how that was only ever going to be temporary, and new variants would put a damper on that. So, quite to the contrary, the ""official"" line of the day back in early 2021 was not ""never worry about Covid again because you now have the perfect vaccine that'll keep you from ever catching it,"" it was quite literally ""even though you now have this vaccine that's 90%+ effective at stopping infection, stay cautious because there's still a slim chance you could catch it, and that efficacy will wane when new variants come out and as time goes by.""So maybe I'm going crazy because what ""officials said"" about vaccines was literally exactly what ended up happening, great vaccines that became less great over time due to variants, and eventual boosters. And yet somehow vaccine skeptics are spinning the exact polar opposite narrative. Do people genuinely falsely remember a time when we were promised this perfect vaccine? Or is this a cynical leveraging of the Mandela effect, hoping to convince people who weren't ever paying that close attention in the first place?",2821,472,0.9804,0.075,0.814,0.111

6331,Destiny,"Destiny made some questionable claims about the nazis and communist colaborating aginst the SDP. I'm sure there have been discussion on this issue on this sub before but after Destinys comments in his most recent reaction video to the Shapiro interview I thought it would be good to point out some incorrect points Destiny made.  (around 16-22mins)Claims Destiny makes paraphrased: &gt;The communists and the Nazis worked together against the social democrats who were the liberal establishment. The willingness of the communists to collaborate with the Nazis was at least party motivated by their belief that the Nazis were not a serious threat. There were times where the communists fought the Nazis but only a little bit. The KPD refused to ever work with the SDP.Btw I haven‚Äôt seen the reddit post Destiny made on the Vaush subreddit so maybe his take is more nuanced and correct there. But I'm just gonna look at what he said in the video. Firstly it is true that the nazis and the communists did collaborate and support each other in some instances . The 1931 Prussia referendum is an example of one of these times. Another and even better example is the 1932 Berlin transport strike organized by the communists and supported by the nazis. Destiny is also right to point out that the communists like the nazis were very much a ‚Äúanti-establishment‚Äù political movement not focused on parliamentary democracy. this to some extent made the sdp a common enemy. Where destiny is absolutely wrong though is his wider characterization of the relationship between the national socialists and communists. These parties absolutely hated each other and would under no circumstances collaborate for example in a government. One example of this is when the Nazi party and the KPD together get a 52% majority in the Prussian state election in 1932 and are absolutely unwilling to form a government with each other. The communists and the SDP did though collaborate politically quite a bit and were even in a government together once. They also collaborated in organizing the workers. The political collaboration stopped only in 1929 when the KPD skewed more left and more revolutionary. The KPD and the Nazis also like one of the commentators pointed out would very often engage in political violence against eachother in the 1930s. In the clip Destiny claims this only happens after the Nazis have already seized power not before. This is totally wrong. Political violence was very common in the Weimar republic after the depression and was most often instigated by either the communists or the national socialists and committed against each other. The communists did in some cases attack the social democrats as well but to a far far smaller extent. As noted the communist party was an ‚Äúanti-establishment‚Äù party in the sense that it had no interest in the democratic process and was very unorganized and undisciplined. The communists believed in fighting for their political goals on the streets and not in parliament but this fighting was not targeted against (except sometimes) the sdp it was focused on fighting the national socialists. Their mutual disdain for parliamentary politics might have weakened the democracy they were both fighting against but it didn‚Äôt unify them. They were still focused on fighting each other. In fact, one of the main dividers of the communists and the SDP was their method of fighting fascism. Though just to be clear the KPD did become a very far left party during the depression and did not see the SDP as an ally rather a movement that stood against them. I think the perspective of anti-establishment and pro-establishment movements as another axiom to look at political movements through is a very useful one. But in this case Destiny relied it this way too much and almost totally disregarded the actual political goals of the respective movements and in addition to just being wrong on the facts. Claims like ‚Äúthe communists fought the nazis a little bit‚Äù are just patently false. As a source look at the Oxford Handbook of the Weimar republic part 3 chapter 15 it‚Äôs a pretty short read. As well as just random wikipedia knowledge that‚Äôs easy to fact check. This might be a little bit too ban baity but It‚Äôs really frustrating to see Destiny falling for the same kind of argumentation that‚Äôs often used against him. There are a few facts that do support his claim but If you read any reputable history textbook on the subject there just isn‚Äôt any way to come out of it agreeing with his characterization of the facts. The absolute same thing could be and is often done by communists to paint the SDP as Nazi collaborators. That case is at least as strong at the one destiny argues.",4718,798,-0.9545,0.131,0.754,0.115

6355,Destiny,"Vaccines Mandates are Bad Regardless of Vaccine Effectiveness. Recently, Destiny (God of debate, ameliorator of chains, lord of salience, wielder of Dan, master of Moutins, keeper of Melina) had a discussion with several orbiters regarding vaccines. In the discussion Erin aka Straighterade (a highly based orbiter) speculated about bodily autonomy in the context of the Matt Dillahunty debate and covid vaccine mandates. She further stated that there might be better ways to get people to take vaccines such as social pressure. My position would be one step further right than this in that I believe that even many localized vaccine mandates (such as those levied by a corporations) are bad for non-medical workers (such as office workers, line operators, construction workers ect.). The following are the propositions that I would make. 1.) bodily autonomy has moral value. a.) It does not have the moral value equivalent to a human life as in the case of abortions (I am pro-first trimester but anti-second trimester abortions for context.) b.) It does have moral value equivalent to a certain threshold of risk to another human. An analogous situation would be driving a car. By doing this action, you inherently cause risk to other members of society. However, the autonomy to drive a car is a good enough thing to outweigh the concerns of risk to others and thus meets a threshold of risk. 3.) Vaccines themselves are effective and based. For 99.99 percent of people, there is no good reason not to take a vaccine. I am not interested in arguments concerning their efficacy as it is irrelevant to my arguments. Similar to gun arguments, there are inherent risks we take by having rights. More people die because we own guns in the U.S. The argument is value based i.e. the ability to not be vaccinated is more important than the benefit than we get from taking it. a.) More people will die if more people are unvaccinated. This is true. However, as with lockdowns, I believe the freedom granted to all of society is more important than the lives lost. This is not unlimited as no freedom is unlimited. However, the threshold should be higher. b.) Not having mandates does not mean that people will not get vaccinated. Arguably, a lot of anti-vaccination arguments are built around the desire to not be forced to take a vaccine. Talking points against vaccinations in my opinion are built around an anti-mandate idea rather than a genuine belief that vaccines are actually bad. 4.) Whether or not private business should have the right not to mandate vaccinations for their employees is a different question than whether or not they should in the same way your ability to say something vs. whether or not what you said is good or bad are two different questions. My position is that private businesses should not pursue this in most cases outside of the medical field. 5.) Vaccination mandates are not as bad as lockdown mandates. The negative consequences of lockdowns is far more severe than vaccine mandates. There are essentially no costs to taking a vaccine. There are severe consequences to being locked down. I am categorically opposed to lockdowns even if they save some lives. The ability for all of society to live normally is something that I do not believe the government should have the right to take away especially for the threshold of people covid killed. Lockdowns are one of the most severe measures a government can take. I would argue basic freedom of movement is more fundamental than freedom of speech. We defend freedom of speech despite demonstrably negative consequences. Why not freedom from lockdowns? It seems fundamentally inconsistent, that anyone could support second or third trimester abortions, and also support vaccine mandates. If bodily autonomy is valuable enough to kill a conscious human, then by extension, it is valuable enough to prevent a covid vaccines which only creates a percentage risk to another human. It is sad that our vaccination rates are not higher. However, I believe that if bodily autonomy is morally worth enough to extend the right to an abortion up to 20-24 weeks, it is also valuable enough to extend the right to not have a covid vaccine despite the health benefits offered. I believe most people will take vaccines without mandates (most people in the U.S. are vaccinated), and that much of the resistance to vaccines has come as a backlash to localized and the possibility of federal mandates. There is a threshold where measures like vaccines and lockdowns (vaccines far before lockdowns) would supersede freedom. However, I do not believe covid met a high enough threshold to force vaccines or impose lockdowns. It is not necessary to be anti-vaccine to be anti-vaccine lockdown. Even if the covid vaccine was 110% effective and prevented people from getting cancer, freedom would take president in this situation. A final point to make, is that anti-mandate measures have had a significant negative impact. These anti-mandate measures would not exist without mandates. An example of this can be seen with the Canadian Trucker protest which did damage to Canada's economy and the well-being of residents affected by the protests. Let me know what you guys think. I am interested in different perspectives.",5278,879,0.9726,0.132,0.712,0.156

6378,Destiny,"Walter Reuther, long term President of the United Automobile Workers and a civil rights activist, a giant of 20th century liberalism. Walter Reuther (1907-1970), labor union organizer and civil rights activist, served as President of the United Automobile Workers from 1946 to 1970. Born to Wheeling, West Virginia to socialist German immigrant parents, Reuther was raised around leftist and labor union organizing, as well as being taught opposition to racism. As a child, he and his father visited Socialist Party Presidential candidate Eugene Debs while Debs was in prison for giving a speech against WW1.In 1927 at the age of 19 Reuther moved to Detroit and found employment at the Ford Motor Company, though he was fired in 1932 for socialist organizing. While he worked at Ford, his high skill as a mechanic allowed him to be sent do work on behalf on the company in the Soviet Union, and during his 3 year world tour he had travel through much of Europe, as well as Turkey, Iran, India, China, and Japan.Reuther became associated with the young United Automobile Workers, becoming President of the Local 174 in west Detroit. In 1936 he led the union workers in a successful strike against the Kelsey Hayes, who supplied brake drums and wheels to Ford. Upon Reuther's insistence, women won equal pay for equal work. The speed-up of the assembly line was slowed down and the company could not fire a worker for joining the union. UAW Local 174's membership expanded from 200 before the strike to 35,000 within the next year. Over the years he was involved in organizing a number of important strikes and helped to win many gains for workers.Though he had been a long time Socialist Party member, Reuther joined the Democratic Party in the 1930s and became a strong supporter of FDR. In 1940, Reuther responded to WW2 by promoting the idea of auto manufacturing plants converting to the production of weapons, which was later done after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He personally met Roosevelt in the White House to discuss the plan. Roosevelt would come to refer to Reuther as his ""red headed engineer"". He would later meet with Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson. After the war Reuther was elected President of the United Automobile Workers. He was also President of the Congress of Industrial Organizations between 1952 and 1955, and was involved with its merger with the AFL to form the AFL-CIO.Reuther worked to integrate black workers into the labor unions and fought against segregation. Under his leadership the UAW won many concessions from the auto companies and gains for the workers. Reuther had become a strong anti communist, and had the communists expelled from the labor movement. Despite this, he was viewed with suspicious by many on the right, being called the ""most dangerous man in America"" by some Republicans, and was called the ""most dangerous man in Detroit"" by Governor George Romney. Survived several assassination attempts, such as in 1948 when he was shot through his kitchen window in the arm and back by a shotgun. A year later his brother also survived an assassination attempt by a man with a shotgun. The man was never caught, and FBI director Hoover expressed a complete lack of interest in investigation.Reuther was also a strong supporter of and an activist in the Civil Rights Movement. He knew and worked with MLK, and marched with Dr. King in Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery, and Jackson. Reuther raised $160,000 for the release of protesters, and the UAW raised $75,000 for the NAACP for the Brown v. Board of Education case with the Supreme Court, as well as raised money for several other civil rights efforts. He helped to finance and organize the March on Washington, and spoke there. He was on the board of directors for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He sent letters to Johnson, who he was a major supporter of, even during the Vietnam War, urging greater civil rights measures. Reuther also lent his support and aid to Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers in California.On May 9, 1970, Reuther and his wife died in a plane crash. At his funeral there were 3,400 people in attendance. Dr. King's wife, Coretta King, was one of the speakers. His name lives on in several awards and memorials. ",4300,727,0.9734,0.084,0.798,0.118

(I'm not Chinese, I'm not in China in case it sounds like that)I am totally not on top of the situation and crazy hungover, but what I've seen so far is this:There are currently a lot of student protests going on, against the party, against covid measures, in the end it all leads back to the covid policies and the impact it had on people, including a very recent fire in Urumqi killing 10 (I think), that also relates to covid measures. It's not only students protesting of course, but that's what's happening right now mostly as far as I can tell.This seems to be a list of the schools who participated yesterday for example.In this subreddit you can currently see a lot of videos and fotos of protests, and a lot of posts by Chinese relating to all of these events, so I basically came to share that and encourage people who are interested to have a look, should be possible to navigate the subreddit with deepl or google translate.I'm saying it is historic because this is just not something that happens on this scale, and this bluntly. For me personally it is really special to witness and I want other people to be able to see more than the headline news article talking about protests in China, I want people to see the actual people and students fighting for their rights and the way they do it, the courage they show.

Destiny has repeatedly called this ex-orbiter of his a narcissist, mentioning how drags down and directly hurts the people who interact with him, how this person ,at times, psychotically manipulates vulnerable and impressionable people en mass and has no problem divulging personal information of others in order to get material to which to enforce his delusions with.Yet Destiny in a recent stream admits to signing his checks, and I'm fairly certain that he hosts this persons website, where he continues to foster an audience. This person has proven himself to be harmful to everyone he interacts with, consistently trying to gaslight and manipulate anyone to believe the current narrative he peddles at the given time. I am not an advocate for deplatforming but unlike before, it is not only his health that his at risk now. By providing this rapist with a website, and an ability to steam is Destiny not enabling the aforementioned behavior? Is he not putting potential people in harms way? as it grows ever likely that he might successfully connect out to 2 particularly unpopular female streamers as well as their audience, giving him ample opportunity to gaslight more people?I understand that this call might sound somewhat similar to Rosewrists situations, how he lost his site and was barred form ever interacting with Vaush community ever again. Yet this suggestion does not come from a place of political disagreement, or personal dislike of the person or the people he may or may not interact with in future but a genuine concern of what mind fuckery this rapist would subject people to if his audience and influence were to grow by the website Destiny has provided him. And if this person does end up putting people through mental abuse would Destiny truly share no responsibility in enabling his ability to do so?Please understand that these question come from a place good faith and concern. Any details that have been left out our simply mistaken are not coming from a place of malice but ignorance. If you observe any of such missing/mistaken details please notify me in the comments and I will be more than willing to fix them.",2706,458,-0.9414,0.125,0.762,0.112

6498,Destiny,"Why I find aba take on Fat shaming confusing , Ultimately hypocritical and what defines a Slur. Aba recently pushed hard making an emotionally charged argument against the normalization of obesity and the disproportionate impact on the black community which I agree with.The problem is the point of the body positivity movement initially being ignored here. It was to make you feel comfortable with your body so you could be mentally healthy which is needed to lose the weight. Its difficult to work on yourself when you absolutely hate yourself. So on one hand we have the normalization of obesity which is wrong but then on the other we have a movement that was to fight the stigma fat people face in our society which Ultimately leads to self hate spiraling in a never ending eating disorder. To make it analogous,  imagine a man who is laid off , has nothing he owns , no girlfriend,  no family , lonenly , just broke living off employment at age 30.Let's say he lied to a woman saying he had a good job to get a date like the false narrative he thought was true off the woman he called a fat whale.Do you think it's appropriate to call him a broke fuq , a bum , not a real man and so on pushing this pressure of what a man is supposed to be in our society and then say it's just jokes? Now imagine if we started normalizing men to be bums , to be complacent living of the government and what not.Obviously that would be wrong but you can't feel so indignant about one and not the other.To aba they are just jokes where the energy is not even remotely the same to the normalization of obesity or men being bums living off the government in my example.And a slur need not be an immutable characteristic but merely a hateful insult to a group of people. There's slurs to insult poor white people which is not an immutable state so it naturally follows a wide spread insult of hate can be deemed a slur. Now I'm not saying all slurs are equal but to say "" Fat whale"" is not a slur would be disingenuous. And if aba is find with all jokes then someone should be able to cleverly joke about how diabetes disproportionately impact black people without him being indignant about it. Jokes are just jokes right?",2207,410,-0.9896,0.181,0.711,0.108

And since the sick manipulator abuses the wordage I think this one is important.Destiny said Mr.Girl's crusade is not spite driven, but that he believes he is doing the right thing. And this is mostly true. Mr.Girl does 100% believe he is doing the right thing and that Destiny is an abuser. But his crusade is also 100% spite driven. The direct cause of the crusade is Destiny not agreeing with Mr.Girl on his ban narrowly, but in the meta sense. Destiny not agreeing with Mr.Girl on absolutely everything.I think if Destiny slightly changes the wording of Mr.Girl is not spite driven to: Mr.Girl does not believe he is spite driven, which is more correct.

So I hope this shitpost flair protects me. If you mod and delete my shit w.e. you wack but it's fine just don't ban me i'm learning the ropes. Anyways. I wanna ask yal for advice. How yal feel about me writing my brother his eulogy even though he alive? Like I wanna really show him how much of a pathetic individual he is and dehumanize him. He believes in his life he has faced to bloodshed but I will begin an active crusade against his naked psyche and drive him to the depths of madness. I'll supply some background, but the idea is to make him confront his never ending loneness and be driven to the door of darkness. What decision he makes there is ""on him"". Just like he told me when I reached out for a reason to stay here.  I have laid pieces throughout our lives and made sure that pivotal moments of our bond was orchestrated for weaponized use. For example, when our father died was the perfect time to plant ""word bombs"" in his brain so he may cling to what I said or ""what happened when dad died"" every time he loops. When he came home drunk and laid out cold on the stoop, I left him out to suffer before I ultimately came out just to call him pathetic trash. Recently he tried to use this as ""ammo"" against me to his own friend and the look his friend gave me was one of absolute pity. He is right where I want him.  The man's vulnerability is obscene and pathetic. He ask for approval in ways he fails to comprehend socially. Everyone just puts up with him when he think he's the center of attention. You all know the copium. Its very easy to whittle him down, but he has my enmity. I would do myself a disservice to aim for his mask. I want to attack his very core, I want him  u n s e e n.  I will start by become the dominant male figure in his daughters psyche. Their psychic link is so disheveled that they both can read this and still be vulnerable to my psychic onslaught. My niece is in her teens and well beyond her years academically. The intellectual chasm between my brother and his child is a sight to behold. He is a dead beat dad. He learned from my father. As did I. So I will become the avatar of karma and wake him up to the reality where his most prized identities, this... ""father"", this ""brother"", this family man who ""changed your diapers"" and ""know more than you're going through than you know yourself"". When, in fact, his daughter tells me that she fears him an attention seeking drunkard in a loop, who only can blame her patient and empathic mom for any logical consistencies she uses to dismantle his controlling narrative. She already views me as her favorite uncle and she will participate in a non profit community art center I'm currently renovating. I don't even have to be present in her life. Simply providing an outlet for her creativity, respecting her world view and properly guiding her, not leading, as a parent should, would be enough to crush the identity he clings to whenever I begin to see that creeping red hue behind his struggling eyes.  It is not too late for him. He is a paramedic and runs a non profit emergency response organization inherited from our father. That legacy is one not a normal man can handle and he is an altruistic, driven masculine entity. He has just seen so much death and such disregard for the sanctity of life that he is in perpetual copium. There are two kinds of people in the world who do evil, those who are hurt and confused, and those who choose it. I want to free him from his pain, even if it means obliterating this reality. I will approach him one last time as the avatar of vengeance and indignation, I will cast judgement and risk my family, reputation and life. I will meet him in worded combat one more time and ask that he humbles himself, and listen to my advice. I will tell him to take therapy and stop asking from the world, for at least a month. If he do that, I will stave off my enmity and leave him once again, in gods hands.  However, I am evil. I am sin. And I will use gods grace to consume myself on sight, within reason and social sovereignty. Too bad the psychic landscape isn't really a part of that sovereignty yet &gt;:3",4318,820,-0.9963,0.161,0.736,0.103

6555,Destiny,"how did Destiny's good-faith arc affect you? Although Destin has always been good about bridging both sides especially with his approach of ""you should be able to argue the other side better"" I think the good faith arc was that cranked to be personal.For me it helped me understand that I should approach things from the other person's side and help them explain their point while not completely helping them. Destiny might have steel manned argument but he would leave it there and clarify arguments but for the sake of the point getting across on a more understandable level. It also helped me if we should debate/argue or if I should listen, clarify, and talk about the topic. This ties into the idea of empathy and empathetic listening. We all want solutions, our egos want us to be more right, and we want control. This is different when we just talk to explore a thought and the questions that should be asked to enable someone to explore their thoughts compared to us taking control of the conversation and have leading questions.For me it was an arc that I related to a lot along with the times it backfired but also helped me see through actors (not the term of performances but people interacting) who are looked up to when having an audience where it is right and wrong towards how charitable we are and where we need to draw lines.",1343,240,0.7267,0.055,0.853,0.091

At best I just disagreed with him, because we have fundamentally different moral axioms. I understand why we disagree on principle.  In order to challenge my bias, I've tried to think about experiments, to test, whether Destiny has too much sway over me. My initial thoughts were to ask the community, whether they can think of a drama debate, where he was in the wrong, and hopefully I'll be able to watch the debate, and find out why he's wrong.  Destiny is the only streamer I watch, when drama occurs, and I don't do my own research. I'd like to think, that's sufficient in taking sides. (atleast sometimes for example with the mr.

This is something I was never taught in primary school. I think I only heard about this when I was like 20. Yes, probably the worst plague in human history wiped out like 90% of the indigenous populations of the Americas. Unless you lived on a Caribbean Island, most of these indigenous peoples would've died without seeing a white person. This mainly happened because of the animals and animal diseases brought over by the Spanish from Europe. These are diseases that the indigenous peoples of the Americas were never exposed to before, and they spread like wildfire. This, unfortunately, seems inevitable no matter who came from across the Atlantic or Pacific. This is not to say genocide and ethnic cleansing weren't done by Europeans; this absolutely happened, even when Columbus landed on Hispaniola. It's just a deranged narrative to say that Europeans did the same thing to Ingenious people of the Americas as the Nazis did to the Jews. The Nazis killed half of the world's Jewish Population in 6 years through bullets and gas chambers. Also, I highly recommend the latest hardcore history podcast episode.

Most of the more damning information comes from one person whose story changes a bunch of different times, as well as various ""anonymous sources"" who are almost guaranteed to be the same guy.But I think this article circulated a lot at the time and played into the ""media blackout"" narrative, so it's basically about whether you believe Greenwald on whether he was censored or not.  I think the more likely option is that nobody wanted to publish the story because it was an obvious attempt at a smear campaign with little to no substance.I'm also not saying nobody published it, either, because plenty of people did.  But when people say ""media blackout"", they're probably talking about those few outlets that chose not to publish it.",1322,226,-0.3415,0.043,0.934,0.023

During the conversation you wondered if anyone would watch Joe Rogan if he was by himself without guests. I've been listening to Joe for over a decade. I've watched all of his comedy specials and have listened to at least 100 of his podcasts from start to finish.In my opinion nobody watches his podcast if it's just Joe. Joe by himself is his stand up comedy not the podcast. The main reason I think this is because every time i've ever stopped listening to one of his podcasts was because the person he was talking to wasn't very entertaining or interesting. Joe will sometimes rescue his guests if they're struggling, but for the most part if they aren't interesting then Joe isn't enough to save the show. This is all my opinion of course.

6695,Destiny,"Will it be 2016 all over again? Why I think we should take Trump more seriously. The recent news about collusion between Ye, Trump and Fuentes (not Sneako, whOmegalul) has made me consider the 'JQ' discourse in  a new light, and I think we should be extremely worried about a repeat of 2016 where Trump/[insert populist of the day] rises to power off of the unaddressed concerns of the disaffected majority - but this time, with an antisemitic twist. Endless articles and books have been written on Trumps unexpected success in 2016, but beyond Hillary being a shit candidate, and myriad other political happenstance, white, rural America voted for Trump because they felt he was speaking about their problems in a way no one on the left was willing to address.Trump's promises to 'bring manufacturing jobs back' and address unfair trade relations with China - while ultimately unfounded and misguided - in the minds of many Americans spoke uniquely to the very real issues they faced in daily life. Other proposals such as the Wall, and draining the Swamp were more ridiculous, but you have to understand that from their perspective, Mexican immigrants and the Deep State after 8 years of Obama were the most pressing issues of the time. Dems failed to address really any of these issues, instead running on their usual messaging of healthcare, tuition, and social issues. To the average trucker/grocery store worker facing layoffs due to mass automation, the choice seemed obvious. In fact, the dems still failed to address these issues (except for Yang I guess lol) in the 2020 elections, and I'm convinced that had a less republican-friendly candidate than Joe won the Primaries we would have had another 4 years of Trump. This brings us to today: There seems to be this rising undercurrent of antisemitic rhetoric, originally under the guise of 'George Soros globalism', but is now mostly mask-off. The left will never address these issues 'seriously' (from the eyes of the supporters), as simply refuting the idea that 'Jews control the world' without addressing the central premise that there are many Jewish people overrepresented in certain areas, is just not convincing to many of these conspiracy driven types. In fact this issue is unique in that it strangely transcends political boundaries. I am not Jewish, but have many people close in my life who have experience a startling amount of antisemitism from the left (typically in the form of younger, more radical people being anti-Israel, but also more recently with Ukraine). This scares me, as the only pushback against this antisemitism comes from the moderates, who have a history of not having a particularly loud voice. Kanye is somewhat irrelevant in this beyond being a clout-bridge, but the combination of Fuentes and Trump bodes ill to me. Trump's bid at presidency initially excited me as the prospect of splitting the Republican vote against Desantis, as well as his lackluster messaging whining about 2016, seemed like a sure-fire win for Dems. However, I see a potential now for Trump to pivot from his ineffective election denial, to a much more potent rhetoric of antisemitism. Although he has been pro-Israel, we know that he is not a principled political leader, and only says what he believes will serve him best in the moment. I can envision a world now where he rides this wave of populist anti-Jewish sentiment (maybe under the globalist/zionist/[[[they]]] dogwhistles) to the nomination, especially with support across the isle from insane lefties. Trump was underestimated in 2016, due to Dems dismissing the issues of middle-aged, rural, white men - and why wouldn't they? It's not as if these people had a voice in social media at the time - they were all banned.  The lefts immediate shutdown of any discourse related to Jews is leading to the asymmetry Destiny often points out about how unprepared leftists are to combat ideas they have censored out of their echo chambers. The left is not prepared for this fight, especially when it comes from across the political spectrum, and the Trump x Nick x Ye collab brings us every closer to this reality. There are a large contingent of people who feel this way about Jewish people and we need to address it head on - or we're in for another surprise on election night. TLDR: Trump will pivot to Nick's messaging, and ride another unseen political wave to nomination as Dems refuse to engage with the problem seriously.",4456,747,-0.9765,0.102,0.832,0.066
6696,Destiny,"Remember when Nick Fuentes said 'The Jews hated Hitler because he was a Christian and a Nationalist and declared war on Germany before anything even happened'? Here's the link.I really don't understand how he can even be seriously debated. Anti-semitism aside, he says the most flagrantly contrived and historically inaccurate crap imaginable and then goes ""There's a little redpill for you!"" as if taking enormous pride in just having dropped some major truth bomb that is being concealed from the public.Nick brings up how 'The Jews' ( several Jewish-American organizations, a few of which initially opposed or abstain in order to avoid more tension until they realized it isn't helping ) declared war on Germany, referring to well-known 1933 Anti-Nazi boycotts as soon as Hitler was elected chancellor 'before anything even happened' and because they 'hated him for being a christian nationalist'. As the wiki article states, apparently Hitler's authoring of Mein Kampf in which he dehumanizes and calls for the destruction of Jewry, even saying he wishes they all died from the type of poison gas used in WW1, and the formation of the Brownshirts ( SA ) in the 1920's who terrorizes and lynched Jews throughout Germany, and of course the Nazi's party encouragement of boycotting all things Jewish from the moment their ideology was first coined, all count as 'nothing happening' until the reaction of Jewish organizations to Hitler's appointment as the straw that broke the camel's back.Jews automatically hated him for being a nationalist, seeing as how none of the Jewish soldiers who fought in the Wehrmacht during WW1, including Hitler's own commanding officer whom he actually allowed to leave Nazi Germany with his pension under a Gestapo escort in recognition of their past history, could've possibly been nationalists themselves. And since there weren't any other Nationalist, Christian, and Christian Nationalist parties in the Weimar Republic, including Hindeburg's party, which mysteriously never got boycotted by any Jews.They did all get shut down by the Nazis as soon as they rose to power though. In fact, the Nazi party then also proceeded to persecute none other than Nick's favorite institution - The Catholic Church, since their vision often misaligned and the Nazis also wanted exclusive control. How can someone be such a two-faced worm willing to peddle the most brazen lies imaginable, including covering for those who *actually* attacked ""his faith"", just to propagandize against Jews a little bit more? You know I'm starting to think Nick would probably be clapping and cheering for the Nazi party as they were fighting with the Catholic Church, almost as if he was never on the Catholic side at all.

A lot of the things Devin and Destiny said were good solid investment advice.I really like the ""stay in your lane"" take from Devin. There are a lot of different ways you can invest your money, but the best way is always the way you actually understand. There are a few quotes I remember from studying finance years ago.. the first one - which relates to this is ""If I look at an investment prospectus and I can't figure out how they're making money within 5 minutes, I don't invest."" This is agreat rule of thumb to keep you from investing in things you don't understand - and it will help keep you out of convoluted ponzi schemes that seem prolific in the crypto space. The majority of investors should stick to ETFs. Destiny gave this piece of advice years ago.. and it still holds true today (I believe I remember a video where he was giving Ice Poseidon advice, and Ice Poseidon was talking about buying property and Destiny was warning him about all the costs involved in owning property and advising an ETF instead). This is really solid advice. Consider for a moment, the hundreds - thousands of highly trained, highly paid, highly sophisticated investors on wallstreet, managing billions - even trillions of dollars in wealth on behalf of their clients. You need to realise that it takes an incredible amount of hubris to think that you can beat these guys at their own game. Do you really think that because you watch a youtube video about how wallstreet has gotten a stock price wrong, you now have the ability to outplay these guys? You don't. I'm not saying wall street is perfect, but they are at the forefront of what is possible in the stockmarket space. There are some investors that are exceptional - warren buffet for example, but look back at what actually made Wareen Buffet rich. He didn't just pick the right stocks and get rich off passive income.. he went into struggling businesses, saw potential, bought them out and actually went in andturned them around. That's what made him his wealth. Can you do that?Another quote I rmeember from my university days. ""If my taxi driver starts talking about a stock, I know it's time to get out."" Think Tesla, think Bitcoin.. these have become household names, and they are incredibly risky investments.It's true that all investments come with some risk - if there's no risk it's not investment, it's arbitrage. It's important to manage your risk profile. Younger people can generally handle more risk - since your gains will average out over the ""long term"".. but older people who likely will need to turn their investments into money to sustain themselvesi n their old age should stick to low risk investments - utilities stocks, bonds or things like longevity insurance (a growing annuity tied to inflation) are good for older people. That said, I wouldn't recommend cryptocurrency as an investment even for young individuals, the risk is just too great. Honestly I wouldn't even call cryptocurrency an investment, it's pure speculation - a ponzi scheme. I actually agree with everything Destiny said about it in this video. It is funny how it started off as this rebellion against banks and fiat currency, but as cryptocurrency matures people are realising more and more why our current financial system works as it does. It went from people saying cryptocurrency being good because the government can't regulate it, to saying cryptocurrency will finally be good once the government adopts and regulates it. The irony. Crypto rant aside.. there were a couple of things I took issue with in the video. Firstly I don't think Destiny should really have said that buying a hosue to live in is not investing. It is. But he's right that you're not ""Getting into real estate"" as most people would understand it. Maybe that's just a nitpick.. but as a portion of networth, the family home is often the largest part of a families portfolio.. and while it doesn't generate visible cashflow in - and has maintenance costs etc.. you are saving on any rental payments you would make in future. That said I don't even think buying a house is for everyone. Not just because a lot of people can't afford it these days.. but there are situations where renting can be better. For one, if you don't plan on living in the house for a long time, renting will often be better. The lawyers fees, real estate agent fees etc involved in buying and selling houses is quite significant, so if you're buying and sellign houses frequently you're going to get torn to shreds by that. Here's the biggest reason for buying a house however. A lot of people struggle to have the self control to save money. I'm not talkign about the people on minimum wage and high rent who are trapped in poverty - I feel for you.. but there are people with well paying jobs who go out drinking every weekend, buy fancy cards and have car payments to deal with etc etc, and end up having their entire paycheck gone each week regardless.  If you are one of these people and you don't have the self control to save, then it doesn't matter what you want to invest in - you're just not going to have any money to invest and you'll never get rich.For these people, owning a house and having a mortgage payment that automatically comes out of their account - which they can't spend, essentially forces them to save. Another argument for buying a house - a few years ago when crypto was at a peak, a friend of mine told me he was worried about what it could mean if cryptocurrency took over, since he didn't have any. But he'd jsut bought a house. What I pointed out was, if fiat currency does crash to 0 against cryptocurrency as the loudest cryptobros like to say - or did at the time, then actually that would be great for him. Why? Because in terms of fiat currency he had negative exposure. Sure he had some cash i nthe bank.. but hsi mortgage was in fiat, so essentially he had a net negative balance of fiat currency. In which case if it crashed to 0, sure he'd lose all the cash in the bank - or all the value of it, but his mortgage would also become worthless too, while he wouldstill have his house, and whether bitcoin or dollars are used as the main currency a house is still worth a house. - Obviously I don't actually see fiat dropping to 0 against bitcoin.now what really annoyed me about the video: Dan. Like god damnit Dan, you go ahead and buy your office space or whatever, if you want to speculate on it go for it. But you DO NOT KNOW if demand for office space will rise or fall in the future. That is pure speculation and you should not be offering that as investment advice to anyone. A little about me: Since I'm making some takes on investment here I should give some background. First of all, I'm not a millionaire or billionaire. I have not gotten rich off investments, but I am 30 and I own a house and a small portfolio of stocks. I have a Bachelors degree in Finance and I had a GradDip in Information Science. These two qualifications give me some confidence when I'm talking about cryptocurrency in particular - although it was never part of the curriculum, I have the background knowledge to a) understand current financial systems and why they work the way they do, and 2) the tech literacy to understand how cryptocurrency and blockchai nactually work -, and I have done much of my own research o nthe topic of cryptocurrency as I find it very interesting, espite having no interest in it as an investment.",7518,1345,0.9981,0.068,0.807,0.125

That doesn't feel right at all. A man can inseminate your girl and get her pregnant. In terms of evolution, what disadvantage does the man face if the woman sleeps with other women? They can both take care of his child together; a woman will not abandon her child because she had sex with another woman. If a woman sleeps with another man, it seems unfathomable/unreasonable for the man not to care because the risk for the man is astronomical in terms of pregnancy and fidelity. If ""insecurity"" about her getting pregnant is what Destiny means, then sure, but that can only happen if she sleeps with a man. My understanding is that's not how Destiny uses insecurity, he talks about dick size or what the other man can provide that you can't. I'm sure that could be true for some men, or even most men, but why use that as the justification instead of the more reasonable take about pregnancy and men having evolved to prefer purity for the reasons mentioned above?I feel like because Destiny is an anomaly in this regard, he has a blind spot in these types of discussions. He should do research on these topics like he does in other topics to be better informed/armed when having these discussions which will inevitably come up for many years to come on his stream or future interviews/collabs. It would be beneficial for the viewers and the discourse. It could be the case that he's right, but I find it hard to believe. Imagine Melina getting pregnant by another guy.

6806,Destiny,I want some advice about this situation. So I‚Äôm a international working in the US. Recently i have been trying to buy a car recently (subaru crosstrek manual) which are pretty rare.I found this car online and setup an appointment to test drive that evening( in 3 hours from setting up appointment). When i got to the dealership i met an agent they said they will bring car for me to test drive. Made me wait for a little bit and the agent returned and said i unfortunately can‚Äôt test drive. So i asked did they sell it? They said yes. Said sorry i had to drive out and i left.After coming home i felt something was off with that agent because they usually try to sell you some other car they have at the dealership. I noticed the car was still listed the next day so i made my roommate apply for it and they gave him a new appointment for the same car. I still gave them benefit of doubt and wanted to be sure that they weren‚Äôt discriminating so i made a white friend call them and confirm they had the car and they gave him an appointment. I still wanted to be sure so i texted the agent that i saw the car online if it was still available. They told me it was sold in kinda rude way. What do you guys think about this situation. Was i discriminated against? I have my friends appointment tomorrow to go check out the car. Is it right for me to still buy this car if i like it? Should I call them out for this? I can afford this car and have a credit score of around 700. For context I‚Äôm south asian brown skinned and have an accent but i think i speak decent english. I went after work to the dealership and wasn‚Äôt looking presentable. This dealership is big dealership. A friend who i spoke to about this said I‚Äôm  hypocritical if I give them my business. Is it right for me to leverage this happened to me to negotiate? I have screenshot of texts and emails,1861,362,0.8869,0.03,0.901,0.069

The reason the first movie ends with paul killing someone is that Paul becomes a religious dictator that kills the most people jn history. Thematically it makes sense before they Paul does some fucked up shit. He is also wrong about the circumstances of the knife fightSimilar to a character in Lawrence of arabia. Lawrence early in the movie risks his life to save a man, Gasim who was left behind while traveling across desert.  Later lawrence is forced to honor local peace treaties (so he could raid Aqaba with their alliance) had to execute Gasim, which immediately haunts him. Later recounting at the British HQ in cairo that he was worried he enjoyed it.In Dune, Paul has Orange tinted visions of a fremen man who in a kind and fraternal manor shows him ‚Äòthe way of the desert‚Äô. When Paul meets this man he is aggressive. Going into this scene Paul has to make a choice, does he fight and kill this man, or does he try to make his vision come true.  Paul hadn‚Äôt known the ways of the fremen. Basically the first book is about his rise to power.

6815,Destiny,"Destiny‚Äôs Relationship Take On stream he mentioned that most guys are probably ok with their girl getting with another girl, but would freak out if they get with a guy. He said this is mostly due to insecurity. I‚Äôm paraphrasing but I think this is a fair representation of his thoughts.I think it‚Äôs a bit of an oversimplification. If your girl is getting dicked down by a girl with a strap on, I think many guys will feel some type of way. Conversely, if their girl is pegging another dude, they probably wouldn‚Äôt have as strong of a reaction.I believe, in most relationships, men take a more dominant role in the bedroom. That‚Äôs why I think guys don‚Äôt mind if their girl got with a girl if she took on a dominant role and would probably come around to their girl getting with a dude if she took on a dominant role.I agree with destiny, guys will tend to compare themselves with the other partner of their girl if it‚Äôs a guy, but i disagree with the why. If you‚Äôre offering your girl something in the bedroom and she is looking for similar things in other bedrooms then it‚Äôs inevitable to compare, but if she‚Äôs look for something different then you don‚Äôt really feel the need to compare.That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt agree with his take about guys not feeling some type of way if their girl gets with another girl. If she is looking for something similar in that bedroom to what you provide her then you will start making comparisons too. Depending on your bedroom dynamics, if you ‚Äùdominate‚Äú your girl in the bedroom, then you don‚Äôt want her to be ‚Äúdominated‚Äù by other guys or girls. Also, you would probably be ok with her ‚Äúdominating‚Äù girls and eventually guys too.What do you guys think?

6825,Destiny,"Preemptive vegan counter arguments against Destiny's fleshing out of carnitas arguments On stream today, Destiny said he could flesh out why being vegan leads to problems. Some of which were, 1. If animals feeling pain is bad then that means there are bad things happening in nature all the time. 2. Our biology is suited for eating animals.3. Animals are not held to the same ethical standard as humans.4. Animals can kill you if they wanted to.I'll be using this definition of Veganism; ""*Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to  exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation  of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and  by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free  alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In  dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products  derived wholly or partly from animals*."" 	- Vegan societyI'll also be assuming you have the arbitrary axiom of ""suffering is bad"".To address the first point, the purpose of being Vegan is to reduce suffering you might cause in a reasonable way. Whether or not a lion is eating a gazelle's balls has nothing to do with whether I reach to grab the vegan cheese or dairy cheese. I can accept that animals are hurting one another because flying to Africa to stop lions would be impracticable.   Addressing the second point, this claim isn't something that needs to be debated because one of two things are true. We either need animal products to survive and/or to be healthy or we don't. Unless you think you do need animals then it doesn't matter what our biology is ""suited"" for. Just because I have suitable prostate to be massaged doesn't mean I should massaged it.    Third point, If you accept that a baby doesn't have moral agency then surely animals don't. If you do think babies should be put on trial then you are sending them to amos yee in jail. Idk if that's a good thing.   Last point, I think it's funny when carnist bring this point up. WE DON'T EAT CARNIVORES. A cow will not kill you to eat you. We eat herbivores. However, being good faith I will grant you that I would kill a bear or lion if it attacked me. Might as well eat it if it did. Most people here probably accept self defense as an axiom. One side point is the morality of, ""if I put something or someone in a situation where they would do bad I can preemptively enact retribution because of it"" is problematic for hopefully self evident reasons. Minority report on steroids.  In conclusion to the 2 ppl that read this. You more faded than a hoe lil bro.",2634,465,-0.9483,0.116,0.791,0.093

There's no world in which this person can be considered attracted to non-women, other than on a very technical level.This is coming from a person who thinks that transmen are men, and non-binary people are valid btw.

Here are the modes, generally; Mr Debater: he is honestly engaging, in a one on one conversation, not communicating with chat, going point by point, taking notes. (Example: Any non Haz Russia conversation, Change My Mknd convos,  disagreements about language usage a few months ago)Explainer/ Intrepter: talking through someones positions, light if any pushback, explicitly referencing the audience, helping people to formulate positions, asking for a stance to be taken and defended. (Example: L** or Mr****, early Ana talks, Ukrainian Ana talks)Godstiny: less charitable, conversations that have been done to death, talking points repeated, more insulting. (Example: conversative chatter dunking)Bipolarstiny: Casual, laughing conversation, unserious. But any disagreement is jumped upon aggressively. (Example: Dan convos, Erudite talking about fat loss vs muscle growth, any Lauren Southern convo)In this mode people are pressed for examples (Dan prince example) in a way that people are not pressed in actual disagreements. The Facilitator: Allowing conversation to happen, stepping in to regulate when necessary, isn't actively following the conversation if asked for input will need caught up. (Example: Ana-Fenty convo, various Aba-Dan talks)Its annoying that these modes exist, not because any of them are bad per-say, but its inconsistent. When asked about how he engages with people, the criticisms usually are pointing at anything but Mr Debater, but Destiny will say he is ""literally the best faith person to have this discussion with, I'm listening, I'm taking notes, if I don't understand you no one will"". That is fair, for when he's actually engaged. But he's not always.It's especially annoying whenever the same situation/ topic is ""covered"" in two different conversation styles. Mr**** rape explanation, when talking to Supreme he goes from memeing to hardcore disagreeing, seemingly unable to understand how Supreme could disagree, Bipolarstiny, when Explainer/ Intrepter could've handled the conversation far better.This goes back to Chaeiry's misogyny-esque criticism about the homophobic TikTok girl convo. A role was picked that wasn't disagreeable and so no real discussion happend. The same for viewer call-ins, there's no way of telling if a dicussion will be taken seriously (not that they all should be, and not that they at all deserve to be most of the time).Other people are given more latitude than Destiny to have different hats, but the brand is discussion, debate, good faith, all that, and it's not evenly or consistently applied.",2714,413,0.3855,0.119,0.75,0.131

For a bit of background if anyone cares, I used to HATE Destiny when I first started watching (you can probably find some old YouTube comments that I would disagree with today). I used to be a big Sam Harris fan (clown me), and I hated how aggressive Destiny used to be in contrast to Sam's measured and articulate ways. After years of learning about this weird streamer politics shit, I have come to the opinion that Destiny has the right-no, the moral obligation, to be aggressive to these absolute fucking weirdos online. I have since come to adore our hero Destiny, and have dove headlong into everything I can find.I am fascinated about his lore, and all of the weird characters that he has/is interacting with. I have probably watched at least 1000 hours of his stuff, but I STILL can't help but feel like I am missing some major plot points. I know about the main stuff, like the Vaush and Hasan betrayals, ""The N-word arc"", the Ana shit, the MrGirl stuff, and a lot of other stuff.

No woman is ever ok for him, all are portrayed are bad characters and all content is solely focused on that. How is that ok?!Let's move back to another example: "" **She moved in After 1 Week of Dating..she became HOMELESS 2 weeks later**""(  - she calls this person a mentally ill woman and homeless + makes idiotic jokes about her. This person on her youtube account has a video dating 4 months named ""**Why I choose Vanlife**""(   , she not homeless.

Second, his whole narritive was debunked by BoredPanda (   where that person gave an interview and the real situation was revelead and it is FAR from what Aba was describing. ( also here:   ) Now, since 4 November when he posted the video he had a lot of time for reaserch, so it's not because he is just lazy, it was done on purpose + putting this girl crying on the front on the video shows his misogyny and his reason.  I have many more cases in wich the videos are still up of YT, I just gave one example here in order to not make this post too long.He has 1.8 milion subscribers and has some responsibility to that. Now why it is a form of harrasment? It is harrasment because of his big audience and because he uses that content to bash women without any responsibility to the content he is creating AND in doing so allowing his fanbase and also Denstiny fanbase to some extent to doxx people and make fun of them! We all know that is happening and how internet works!

6908,Destiny,"Europe and free education I often see Americans complaining how they have to pay for college while most of Europe (Germany, France, Spain, Scandinavian countries etc.) doesn't. While this is a fair point, there is one thing you should keep in mind.School is entirely structured in Europe than it is in the USA. Take Germany as an example. At the early age of 10-11 children are divided between several options for secondary school, according to their school results. Meaning only the good students get enrolled in ""Gymnasium"" which is the equivalent of UK's Grammar School. In some countries this starts later. Croatia at 14, Scandinavian Countries at 16 (I believe). Once you complete this you take the final exams and can enroll to college.So while it's true that we have free education, not everyone gets it. Usually it's those that start getting good  grades from an early age and keep that up. This has been sometimes critized by media, because  it disfavors children from poorer backrounds who don't have the opportunities to apply themselves as much as students from middle/higher income families. Secondary, the college life which exists in America is almost non existant in Europe. If you're an good athlete in school, good for you.                                                                                                                             But that doesn't get you to college; as sports is almost completely isolated from university (in comparison to America). Most people also attend the college of the city they live in or live closely to. That means, they are probably going to live the majority of their college life with their parents. Dorms are very limited, usually only international students get them. There are no Fraternity/Sororities, no extremely big college campuses. When you are finished with lectures, you just go home.  Pecentage wise, Germany has 2.95 million students right now (about 3,54% of their population). In the USA it's about 20 million (about 6% of their population). Atleast according to this So to keep in mind, if we would apply the same system in America, as it's practised in most of Europe, the number of U.S students would probably go down. The majority of US students would probably come from atleast middle class families or families that highly value education. There would be no athletes that go to University just because they are good at sport even though they're not so good at school.                                Judging America by their income by race and social class, this would probably mean that the big big majority of US students would just be White and Asian students; even at a more disproportionate rate than it's right now.",2708,429,0.9079,0.044,0.885,0.071

No comments on how they are live, or what they're like when you play them, or the sense of community you get from rooting for your city's teams or whatever else.I think American football is an extremely athletic game. It's really amazing to see all those insane athletes run across the field and be so violent. The game is high scoring too so that's always fun.There's a lot of team play which is fun to watch. And on top of that there are opportunities for individuals to shine.(Like baseball and cricket are team based sports but there's not a lot of interplay there. They just kinda... stand at their spots and catch the ball if it comes their way. At a time there's essentially only three players at play. One throwing the ball. One hitting the ball. One fielding it)But it stops way too much. Mkes it harder to enjoy. And the players huddle around the ball pretty often it's really hard to tell who's who and what's going on until after. When you get to see it from multiple angles. Hockey does that too. They all huddle around thr ball so much. (Which makes sense for the sport, but not fun for someone at home watching on the tele)Football/soccer is a much more fun game to watch. The players are incredibly athletic there as well. (I keep saying athletic players because that's fun to watch. There are sports like cricket where the players with pot bellies can win. I think that's stupid)Lots of teamplay involved. Individuals shine here too. Not a lot of stopping. But the games can feel uneventful when it ends in a low scoring game. I've seen people argue against tjis point saying ""its about the drama and tension""Yea well there needs to be a conclusion to that tension. A tennis rally can go on for 10 minutes but there has to be a conclusion.These people also misrepresent this argument by sahing ""haha big number better small number me no like"". But then get excited when spain scores 7 goals. Higher scores are obviously more exciting. More eventful. Tennis games are also arguably low scores, if you only count individual matches and not sets. But there's a  conclusion to all the back and forth at the end. Which makes it fun to watch.I think both sports have completely valid reasons for people to enjoy them as I've listed them out here. I just wanted to address the way they're misrepresenting each other's arguments.NBA has the best format tjat combines my favorite elements of both sports imo. High scoring. Highly eventful. Lots of team play and individual plays. Don't really stop a lot. Tennis and badminton are fun for the same reasons too but i dont think theyre as popular so I didn't wanna use them as examples",2821,505,0.9974,0.057,0.759,0.184

I started going out with this girl, and she mentioned medical problems in her past. We just started talking so we were hanging  out every day and during this time I was becoming sick. We stopped hanging out for a couple days and just called when I became more seriously ill, I was never fully bedridden just highly congested and a sore throat at times. We really wanted to continue to hang out so once I felt a little better we hung out again.

I find myself agreeing with him on most issues since I'm socially liberal, but the main disagreement I have with him is economic in regards to the size of government and spending/redistribution of wealth because of the beliefs I have in terms of the outcomes that has for society as a whole(ie, it seems to me like a lot of neolibs will acknowledge the higher standards of living Americans have but still push for policies that push us closer to European countries).

6937,Destiny,"Lecture Series on Ukraine üá∫üá¶ For all y'all interested in deep dives on very relevant topics, I highly recommend Timothy Snyder's The Making of Modern Ukraine. It is a Yale undergrad course that just wrapped up (last video went up a week ago) and whose lectures are posted entirely free on Youtube.It's like 20+ hours of content... It's all really good, but if you want the money shot, I recommend class 19, where he connects a lot of events and ideas discussed earlier in the class to explain what was happening during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and how and why Ukraine emerged from it.One of the major themes that I found very moving is the idea that Ukraine has been able to survive the current war because of its robust civil society - that is, connections between ordinary citizens who organize ""unofficial"" groups to discuss... or assist... or fight. There are some good examples of this in class 20 (about the 2014 Maidan protests, delivered by a guest lecturer). It's something I'm frankly a little jealous of, and would like to try to improve in the U.S.Also, there is a lot of deflating of nationalist myths. Especially of Russia, but also (in the last 2 classes) of Germany and the U.S., and (somewhat) of the European Union as a whole. Also, it turns out Polish history is *fascinating*. Also... yeah, I enjoyed this series, would recommend.",1361,238,0.9712,0.056,0.79,0.154

6940,Destiny,"Here's the problem with Counterpoints (Welcome to any reasonable critique from the other side) I've seen a lot of conservatives on here arguing in defense of Counterpoints (and getting shit on) but I don't think I've seen a serious critique of Counterpoint's position (that conservatives can take seriously)I'm not going to talk about the twitter files. If you want to know where I stand, they are good, insofar as they offer transparency into a social media platform that we haven't seen before (outside of a courtroom) but generally, I don't think anything substantial has been revealed, and I think Elon's sole purpose for releasing them in the way that he has is to make twitter relevant, and popular with conservatives (i.e. to establish a base, pander to that base, and milk them for as much money and attention as he can).Destiny's problem in the debate is that he wants to argue one position: that conservatives think twitter shadowbanned people purely based on their political party, which is demonstrably **false,** but he wants Counterpoints to argue this position, even though Counterpoints doesn't want to argue that (even though counterpoints is on Destiny's stream, so he probably should)Counterpoints (connor?) wants to argue that twitter suppressed political topics which just so happened to be aligned with the political interests of conservatives, OuTsIdE oF tHe OvErToN wInDoW, **(this is true, by the way)**, but their inconsistency with how they moderated discourse on the platform is evident of a nefarious political bias to ensure that conservatives lost elections **(which is false.)** First of all, Connor's position is hypocritical, when you have elon musk tweeting about voting for republicans in the midterms - BUT he acknowledges this, when he says that now the shoe is on the other foot, or whatever, and now democrats are going to know how it felt to be a conservative on twitter for the last 10 years. However, and secondly, we know connor is simply incorrect because what was already supposed to be a red wave during the midterms, even with the explicit endorsement of one of earth's most famous/popular grifters (Elon) on a ""free speech absolutist"" twitter turned into a total wash, and the outcome for republican's wasn't even slightly less good, it was plain terrible. But lets address Connor's arguments:1. twitter suppressed political topics which happen to be aligned with conservative talking pointsThis is true. We know it is. When Destiny and Connor disagree on whether it was known or not, I think Destiny makes a mistake. Sure, everyone ""knew"" but that belief wasn't justified until it was released through the twitter files, so now we do know, because there is clear proof. HOWEVER, what is the content of those political topics? 9/11 conspiracies? JFK being assassinated by his secret service agents? No? Oh, we are actually talking about covid denial, fraudulent election claims, and Qanon stuff). The first one supported the objectively false claims that resulted in people literally dying (herman cain award) because of misinformation. The second one resulted in people literally dying on Capitol Hill whether from getting shot, or stampled on, and this isn't even to \*mention\* the members of the capitol police who fucking killed themselves afterwards (Connor wants to jerk off the police until it comes to those defending the capitol). The third one led to a bunch of stuff, but generally was paired with the first two and as I said, resulted in pretty terrible outcomes which could have otherwise been avoided. If twitter suppressed those topics, all of which were objectively false, and also dangerous, that is their first amendment prerogative to do so, and if it just so happened to be conservatives peddling those idiotic positions, those people deserved to be suppressed. I don't see what is so controversial about that statement. They can go to facebook, or instagram, or wherever else, but I don't think there is anything inherently bad about shadowbanning people for those topics.Now, one point I saw which some people made is that twitter allows for all kinds of other discourse which has similar content (socialist revolution, the Supreme leader of iran calling for the destruction of israel, etc.) but I would argue these are substantially different because the outcomes do not substantiate in real life to even a fraction of a degree that  covid denial, election fraud, and qanon have. We all know socialists on twitter are all talk, and also the supreme leader of iran doesn't have the same platform as Donald Trump. Do I support what he's saying? no. Do I support banning trump? eh, not really. Can Donald trump start his own social media company or go on national television whenever he wants? yes. Can the leader of Iran do the same? No. So I don't think twitter should treat them equally. If you know what the first amendment actually guarantees, you would know that Twitter, as far as I know, is not owned by the government, so it can do whatever the hell it wants, INCLUDING selling the company (or forcing the purchase due to his stupidity) to Elon Musk, so it can be your conservative heaven, which Donald probably isn't too crazy about, considering that he started truth social. And to complain about what twitter was doing, is frankly ridiculous if you want me to take you seriously as a ""center right"" pundit like Connor, when your party is responsible for the most fucking insane positions held popularly in modern politics. And this is  my problem with Counterpoints, and why he caught a lot of (deserved, in my opinion) shit on destiny's stream. You cannot be a ""center-right"" conservative, throwing tantrums when people don't take you seriously, if you are going to defend the most asinine and dangerous positions your party has. You can't be anti big tech because of their ""liberal bias"" and then suck on daddy Elon's nuts when he panders so hard to your party. **You can't accuse a PRIVATE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY of** **ELECTION INTERFERENCE because of their internal moderation policy even if you think it is unfair, especially considering what happened during the midterms.** # And you definitely, 1000%, swearing on the grave of Ronald H Reagan, can NOT:# Come up with a conspiracy theory, with zero supporting evidence, citing a personal trauma you experienced, in order to demand that people respect your position, and then get pissy when people point out how insane you are acting.Because if you want people to take your political position seriously as being ""center-right"" (looking at you, Freeza meme poster) and respectfully discuss the policies you claim to care about, you need to call out all the bullshit extremism that is mainstream in your party when you see it. And the last thing you should ever do, is come up with your own idiotic conspiracy claiming that:*  IF the american people had seen hunter biden's meaty cock, * THEN they wouldn't have elected Brandon president, * BUT because the intelligence officials at the FBI and pentagon didn't support Trump, * SO They therefore used twitter to suppress the secret story of hunter biden's laptop that literally every single person in the country was talking about (just go to the fucking new york post website if you want to see it so bad) on the TV, on the radio, on infowars, on 4chan, on truth social, on facebook, or wherever else,* AND AS A RESULT Donald Trump lost the election, which constitutes election interference equivalent to what happened in 2016.In 2016, a foreign nation used their internet agents to sway the political direction of our country through facebook and other social media sites to advance their political interests through deception and misinformation. In 2020, a private company internally decided that some of you motherfuckers are batshit crazy and suppressed those batshit crazy discussions because they resulted in death, insurrection, racism, and general degeneration of political discourse. And one more thing. You can't say ""Oh, I'm on twitch, why are you taking what I'm saying so seriously,"" and then turn around and throw the most pathetic tantrum i've ever seen, because you felt it was appropriate to say ""I had people die in my arms"" as a support to this argument/conspiracy you claim is just a meme when it is very clearly not. People don't take conservatives seriously and they don't vote for conservatives because right now, 2/3rds of the party believe the election was stolen (it wasn't), that Fauci is a criminal and Covid was just a flu (he's no more a criminal than old donny, and covid is serious), or that the vaccine will make you a 5g antennae (it won't), and some (but not a majority) think that jews are evil. And as a consequence of the lack of pushback from people who claim to be ""center right,"" people have died needlessly, and the fundamental principle of our country - democracy, is in serious danger. That's why you guys got shit on in the midterms, not because twitter didn't let you see hunter biden's dick.",9023,1507,-0.9991,0.162,0.743,0.095

When talking with a right-winger, he would agree that there may not be racist laws that target explicitly by race. But he would say that racists now craft laws that aren't calling out the race explicitly but would focus on things that would basically target that race anyways. I.E. A law on a drug that is basically only used by POC. He may or may not call it explicitly racist but he would say it hints at racism and may be problematic. I know he doesnt like invoking racism, but if pressed he would confidently say that this is likely evidence that they are trying to make the law for racist reasons. Well fast forward to Conner argument. He didn't articulate it the way destiny does, but he calls these work arounds ""subvariables"" in the convo.

They cant publically declare they are banning conservatosm.

My problem with this is that it seems to me like Lex is aware of what he is doing. Humor me for a second. If Lex wasn't naive or impressionable as many of you say, would you think he is dangerous? Well, that is the case I'm going to try to make.**Why the Doctor K of AI?** It turns out that he is pretty much a joke in the AI community, this blog post by an actual AI researcher sums up some of the criticism \[1\]. Lex is a researcher at MIT as he is listed in the directory, although his research papers were removed from MIT and the internet from what I can tell. The problem is that none of his research was peer reviewed, his research was cited by Elon when he was selling Tesla's auto pilot feature \[2\]. Lex solicited the press before trying to get his research peer reviewed and when actual scientist encouraged him to submit for peer review before it's published he blocked them. Anima Anandkumar famously was blocked by Lex \[3\], she is a Bren Professor at Caltech and Senior Director of AI Research at NVIDIA. He also blocks pretty much anyone with criticism \[4\]. Missy Cumings a professor at Duke University and director of Duke's Humans and Autonomy Laboratory criticized Lex \[5\] as well. Apparently he preemptively blocks people \[6\].The reason I see an issue with this is not because I want to purity check him but I think this is enough to at least be suspicious of what he says. It annoyed me that he tried to tone police Destiny. He talks about integrity and love.People have actually died using the Tesla autopilot. People were convinced that the tesla auto pilot would improve over time as Elon said and made a purchase. I actually know someone who did this and famously Boogie used the self driving feature as an excuse to buy the Tesla \[7\]. Lex apologized for his research \[8\] but the damage was already done. I don't care about the apology as well because he is still backing Elon and Tesla and the ""research"" already had the positive effects. If he was really sorry, I would expect him to be more critical of Tesla but he won't because he is friends with Elon. Knowing how petty these people are, I really think Elon saw what Destiny said and decided not to unblock him. Why do you criticize the COVID researcher on Joe Rogan over stating his credentials, while you look up to Lex? Is it his suit? The word MIT? Jiujitsu? His deep voice?With all that being said, I have watched Lex in the past and I enjoyed the podcast. I don't hate the guy but I think we should be critical. Love and peace.   1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

Whether he is showcasing his debate skills or dominating in Factorio, Destiny always brings his A-game and entertains his viewers with his infectious energy and enthusiasm.In terms of debate, Destiny's streams are always fascinating to watch. He invites other debaters onto his streams to engage in friendly debates on a wide range of topics, and he often hosts impromptu debates with members of his community. Watching these debates, I have learned a lot about different perspectives and arguments, and I have enjoyed seeing how Destiny and his guests approach each topic.When it comes to Factorio, Destiny's streams are equally engaging. He is incredibly skilled at the game, and he provides valuable tips and strategies for other players. Watching his streams, I have learned a lot about the game's mechanics and systems, and I have even picked up some useful strategies for my own gameplay.But what truly sets Destiny apart from other streamers is his commitment to giving back to his community. He frequently raises money for charities through his streams, and he often partners with other streamers to host larger charity events. This dedication to making a positive impact in the world is truly admirable, and it is one of the many reasons why I am such a fan of his streams.Overall, I am a huge fan of Destiny and his streams. He is a talented debater and a skilled gamer, and his passion for both topics shines through in every stream. If you're a fan of debate or Factorio, I highly recommend checking out his streams.

7074,Destiny,"People's Reaction to Counterpoints Getting Defensive is Mind-Numbing. Regardless of whether his overall argument was sound (spoiler, didn't seem like it was), It is very fair and normal to get triggered when people minimize the awful shit you've seen in your life when they don't even know who you are. Any normal human being who can be in a social situation for 10 minutes without choking themselves to death with their social ineptitude knows this.I understand that Counterpoints kept bringing up his past work when defending his argument, which can be annoying to argue against. But to argue against him constantly pivoting to his own experience is to show that his own anecdotes don't prove his argument, not arguing against the validity of the anecdotes themselves. You see the same thing with people like Candice Owens. She often extrapolates her own anecdotes to say that we can make these broad prescriptive claims for society, but the problem is that when she does that she is extrapolating her own unique experiences and assuming the world fits into that mold. What you DO NOT do is say that her anecdotes never actually happened or weren't that bad, cuz you don't know that, you idiot.You can think his argument is stupid, which is totally fair, but it's very obvious that he's not an asshole (at least from that conversation). When you have a person talking about how they've gone through some really fucked up shit working in an area, the normal human being response is never ""LOL, MY GRANDA DIED, SO WHO CARES!!!

7080,Destiny,"My Experience Cavnassing I'm still recovering from Covid (many of us from the weekend are) and Destiny was sick like the first day, so I think we know who patient zero was...Anyways, I decided to get more involved in stuff like this in 2022 and also was an election worker in my local precinct earlier this year for the midterms.  All I can say is that, yes, it feels weird at first to take the first step, but is incredibly rewarding.  The first few doors were nerve-racking, but they were good experiences and then  the rest of the weekend was so much easier!  I went out all four canvassing shifts - I also worked 17 hours on midterm election day - and felt better after all that than a normal day at work even though it was exhausting.Destiny talked after the 2020 canvassing about the key being accessibility.  If you can make events like this as easy as possible for someone to show up and get to work, it increases volunteer turnout for the future.  Matt and Sejin did an amazing job organizing the weekend on such a short time span and the amount of work that goes into wrangling this amount of people is astronomical.  In fact, it sort of seemed like a lot of the mild problems experienced were because so many people showed up rather than any specific thing going wrong.I'm in the older demo of this community and barely am in chat at all, but DGG was super welcoming.  No one knew anyone else and no group felt cliquey.  Everyone knew everyone else was coming in knowing nobody so we were all trying to find folks to meet and talk to.  I sat down with groups all through the weekend and met new people each time plus a few of the streamers.  I rescued some DGGers with some jumper cables and each group I went out with for actual canvassing were awesome.All I can say is I am energized to do more of this next year even though it won't be with DGG and I really encourage folks to give it a shot in their local communities.  Local groups need help organizing and many are ready to give you a clipboard and make it easy for you to get started.  The social anxiety is a lot to overcome, but you'd be surprised how positive and friendly most people you will interact with are.

Anyway, those making these claims about the Window shifting all have compelling examples. The left can point at mainstream discussions about voter suppression or restrictive immigration policy. The right can point at mainstream discussions of anti-white sentiments and police abolition. But these things aren‚Äôt within the Overton Window. The Overton Window has fractured into two distinct, distant points (not ranges), with a narrower-than-ever Overton Window somewhere in between. Let‚Äôs look at this via one issue as an example (though I think it broadly applies to every major disagreement in society now, such as free speech, police, immigration, Western military intervention, etc). Ten years ago, the Overton Window on trans rights generally spread the range of (on the left) ‚ÄúThere is a distinct difference between gender and sex, and people who experience gender dysphoria are at elevated risks of suicide so should be treated as the gender they identify as‚Äù to (on the right) ‚ÄúIf men want to put on dresses and call themselves women, those [t-slur]s can do whatever they want,‚Äù with most people clustered in ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really care about definitions of gender and sex, but adults are free to do what they want with their bodies, though children shouldn‚Äôt be able to make that decision.‚Äù This Overton Window still exists, in a way (I mean, I still agree with the left position of the window), but most people have now siphoned themselves off to one of the two points that fractured off. The left point says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a bigot if you suggest that a trans person has a different sex from their gender, and the reason we should care about trans people is because they‚Äôre trans, whether or not they have ever had gender dysphoria,‚Äù and the right point says, ‚ÄúTrans people have a calculated agenda to turn children trans, people should not have the right to choose medically what they want for themselves, and doctors who provide gender affirming care should be imprisoned.‚Äù Both of these ideas are, in my opinion, absolutely bonkers. Just plain silly (pardon my language). But both are also completely in the mainstream. How did we get here? The answer to that could be an entire post unto itself; I‚Äôll just keep this brief and conclude. We got this way in part because we drew a line in the middle of the Overton Window and told everyone on our side of the line to stop communicating with those on the other side, and then, even more nefariously, once the new positions had been carved out, the message was to stop communicating with anyone who wasn‚Äôt on the same exact _point_ as you. The Overton Window, to whatever extent it still exists, is a feeble remnant of what it once was, dwarfed by two towers of extremist ideology. So stop fucking complaining about how _everyone_ is more to the right or _everyone_ is more to the right than they used to be.",3324,568,0.9107,0.047,0.885,0.068

I commented that this was super racist and ended up getting brigaded by commies, which is admittedly exactly what I was looking for after a few glasses of wine and nothing better to do with my Monday night. My take on it is that the meme is quite literally calling Chapelle a house n***** for the crime of bringing Elon Musk on stage and making jokes about the people that booed him. Chapelle as of late is super cringe, as is Elon, but I feel like it‚Äôs not insane to say that calling Dave Chapelle perhaps the worst thing you can call a black person is not the height of good commentary and it‚Äôs also super lame and unfunny. Some of the commies who came at me were black, and I got flamed by some people for responding to a black person after they told me, a white guy, that the meme isn‚Äôt racist.

I just wanted to clarify some things counter points said regarding his experience with Law Enforcement.Context I‚Äôve worked for a relatively large police department in Florida for the last two years and this is our general structure.Rank and file cops in my department don‚Äôt carry cameras to take crime scene photos. Crime scene photos are generally taken either by CSI; or by workers called Community Service Officers/ Police Service Aides. The CSO and PSA generally take photos of burglaries to vehicles, minor vandalisms, and car accidents involving damage to city property. CSO and PSA can swipe for fingerprints; however if there is blood involved or if it is a crime involving serious injury, death, or hate speech a CSI tech is dispatched.Now for the rank and file cop in my city most of the time they aren‚Äôt going to be the one conducting the investigation leading to a big prosecution like a murder charge. They will write an initial report detailing what incidents occurred on scene and what they discovered while on scene. But more than likely the case will be passed onto the detective unit due to them being more experienced in knowing what is needed for a conviction and it keeps road patrol officers from being tied down on a case and away from their usual job, patrol.Also in my experience generally to become some type of detective you need a certain amount of time on the road before putting in for a spot. Usually 3-5 years. There are exceptions like if you work in a very large department where they have plenty of openings to fill; or in departments where nobody wants the position and you put in (what happened to me).It is possible in smaller departments patrol officers may have to wear the investigator cap and take crime scene photos.

7171,Destiny,"The actual conversation to be had about Twitter: Should social media companies be regulated as **common carriers**?The legal tension between Twitter's **editorial discretion** (right to moderate content) and users' **free speech rights** (right to use service) has yet to be resolved in the Supreme Court. Since the late 1950's, the Supreme Court has aggressively protected and expanded not just the individual's **right to speech**, but also the public's **access to** the widest range of constitutionally protected speech:""*Smith v California 1959 and its progeny concerned state laws that ‚Äì by threatening liability for facilitating others‚Äô speech ‚Äì prompted intermediaries such as bookstores and newspapers to curtail their distribution of protected speech. As this Court emphasized, intermediaries‚Äô rational caution in the face of potential liability deprives the public of robust access to all kinds of speech‚Äìexactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect.*"" The Court has consistently fought to avoid chilling protected speech by striking down laws that would incentivize free speech intermediaries to impose strict content moderation policies.On the other hand, the Court has also protected **editorial discretion** as an independent component of the Freedom of Speech (CBS v. Democratic Nat'l Committee, 412 U.S. 94 (1973)). Newspapers, online newsletters, TV stations, and any other publishers cannot be compelled to publish speech that they don't wish to publish. They‚Äôre entitled to constitutional protection from government interference with their free speech rights.Common carriers are companies hold themselves out to the general public as providers of transportation or communications services. Because they are common carriers, they must provide these services without discrimination against or in favor of particular persons, groups, or content. Newspapers are not common carriers. Cellular companies, ISPs, railroads, freight companies, and airlines are.  Common carriers cannot refuse service to a person based on their views. Does Twitter function more as a newspaper with editorial discretion, or more like a telephone company offering a public service?If Twitter and other social medias are essentially the most recent technological manifestations of communication services (telegraph, landline, cellular), then they should be regulated as common carriers. Just as a telephone company cannot prevent people from conversing over its networks to express views it disfavors, neither should Twitter have editorial discretion over its users' speech. The Court has already established the liability shield for free speech intermediaries, ensuring that the speech of a social media site‚Äôs users is not the speech of the company that runs the social media site. It then follows that regulating Twitter as a common carrier is not compelling them to publish certain speech, but rather preventing them from limiting individual users' ability to post their own speech.I care greatly about reducing beliefs in covid conspiracies, election denial, racism, homophobia, transphobia, holocaust denial, and every other kind of mind-rot plaguing current U.S. politics. Elon having control of Twitter and its content moderation tools is dangerous and (imo) has the potential to push courts to regulate Twitter and other social media as common carriers, thereby eliminating their right to editorial discretion.",3422,498,0.9885,0.081,0.785,0.134
7172,Destiny,"Investigating my feelings about what happened with Counterpoints Connor continuously got offended that people didn't believe his theory and said over and over that he was getting pissed off that he was being made out to look like some low IQ person and clung onto three dumb ass defenses.   1. Destiny and I agree on 80% (not true)2. Destiny knows me through other mutual friends (and?)3. I was an investigator  The little I knew about Connor was his short time as a cop from panels we've been on before. I did not think he could have been an investigator professionally if it was from his time in policing that would warrant credibility for his conspiracy. I truly believe he is conspiracy brained and actually tried for almost 5 minutes to calmly show him that with his own behavior.  I pointed out that his first claim in the call where he made a statement on the intelligence of the twitter algorithm that he heard from another person would not meet any investigators standard for information they would stake a claim on. Especially after the person (whoever tf that was) felt he needed to clarify what he told Connor (because he was not summarized/repeated correctly) and also went on to say that he offered to go more in depth about it to Connor, implying Connor knew there was more info to learn that he felt he didnt need to be confident in his conclusion.  A reasonable person should be able to see the flaws in having this level of confidence for such shallow understandings and sources.   My humor can totally be toxic. Connor telling me people died in his arms and that he's taken photos and investigated cp and animal abuse was totally irrelevant though, and had nothing to do with the investigator credentials he kept playing like a fucking uno card from 3 years as a parol officer to imply his conspiracies were logical.  Idc about Connor's unhinged insults to me until I see anyone imply I was the ONLY toxic person in that exchange. Interesting he had no insults to WickedSupreme (who also made a joke about him 'solving' that homicide) or anyone else cracking jokes at him. All of it right to my ass. Make it violent, call me a cunt, tell me I need to die and I'm absolutely the fucking worst, spoiled fucking brat that should be killed. I'm used to bringing the absolute best out of people.  What is fucking weird to me is having a dude pull out his trauma like it's a certificate of authority. I consider Counterpoints as much of an investigator as BsBullet but I do truly believe Connor was upset and not just being performative. I think that situation must have been very traumatic and life altering for him. I also still think its irrelevant information and was thrown at me in an emotional rage in response to a snarky comment. All I said was I don't think he should say he was a professional investigator.    tl;dr  I'm sorry you're a cis white male and this is the only victim card you can throw in a debate to win.chaeiry bad",2952,529,-0.9849,0.118,0.814,0.068

7209,Destiny,"Why I love Zionism (not)  Hey guys,I just wanted to share my thoughts on why I absolutely adore Zionism. (That was sarcastic, by the way.)First of all, I love how Zionism is all about saying that Jewish people are better than everyone else and have a ""God-given"" right to the land of Israel. I mean, who doesn't love a good old-fashioned superiority complex? And I especially love how this belief ignores the fact that Palestinian Arabs have been living in the land for centuries. Oops, our bad!But here's the best part: Zionism is also super inclusive and accepting of diversity. (Again, sarcasm.) It only excludes those who don't fit the criteria of being a member of the ""chosen"" nation. So if you're not a Zionist Jew, you're basically a second-class citizen. And if you're a Palestinian Arab, well, you're basically screwed.And let's not forget about all the wonderful consequences of Zionism, like the ongoing conflicts and human rights abuses in the region. The occupation of Palestinian territories, the building of settlements, and the violence against Palestinian people are all just part of the fun of being a Zionist.In conclusion, I absolutely adore Zionism because it's discriminatory, exclusionary, and leads to all sorts of problems. (That was sarcastic, in case you couldn't tell.)

I think that marginalized people ***SHOULD*** have some sort of representation in the media. However, my problem with this whole thing is the shallowness of all of it. I can't buy the fact that a person can ***ONLY*** relate to a character because they have the same skin color or are the same gender.Let's take Lara Croft as an example:She is an extremely attractive young-adult woman who knows multiple languages, is insanely physically strong, knows how to survive in harsh and unpredictable environments, can take down armies of grown and skilled soldiers, has an above-average IQ, and is just badass. Also, she comes from a wealthy family and is posh as hell.Lara Croft is not relatable at all. She is a ***power-fantasy character***. I don't know how a woman can see that and say, *""OMG I'm just like her"".* The thing a woman can say is, *""I relate to Lara's inner struggle to cope with her father's murder because I too lost a family member in dramatic circumstances"".*The problem that arises from this example is that ***ANYONE*** can relate to Lara. Anyone can lose a family member or a friend and say that Lara is super relatable in that way. It stops being ***a woman-specific thing***. That intrinsic shallowness of people's idea of how different people/cultures should be portrayed in mass media is quite baffling to me. A fictional character needs to be something more than a pair of genitals or a different skin tone for that character to work. A film like Moonlight is a great example of well-implemented representation. The subject matter of that film touches on REAL LIFE issues that the black community has to deal with on a regular. The problem is that Moonlight is a ***niche*** little art project that only film snobs give a shit about.Mainstream Hollywood ruins our perception of what representation should mean and I'm sick and tired of it.",2020,343,-0.9154,0.12,0.797,0.083

7253,Destiny,"Actually why Destiny's statement came off as racist *Legion* \- This word was the medium through which the rest of the statement travelled toward the path of racism. In my original interpretation, I saw this word as meaning 'subset', and believe this is how Destiny meant it. Unfortunately, many people interpreted this word as to describe all 'black zoomer streamers'. Example: *There's a* ***legion*** *of patients in the waiting room and they are very impatient.*Coupled with the narrative that patients are impatient, this example paints all the patients in the waiting room to be impatient. Similarly, the harmful black stereotypes on black people being 'wacky and wild' would work to build the idea that such was what Destiny were painting most, if not all, 'black zoomer streamers' as.*Zoomer* \- This word, while there was found to be differences in its connotation, acted to encompass more streamers. There are fewer streamers who act in bombastic 'zoomer' behavior than those that are young. *They* \- Destiny said this word would refer to gamergate, but even on my original interpretation I did not catch this. It definitely came across as referring to black people, or 'zoomer black streamers'.*All these guys do... -* This portion of the statement was meant to define the subset of streamers Destiny was talking about. Instead, because of what was discussed in the *Legion* and *They* segments, it was read as used on all young black streamers.",1457,238,0.0516,0.04,0.926,0.033

I, Steven bonnell aka Destiny, have had enough of your misguided and ignorant opinions on the greatest beverage in the world: hot chocolate.For far too long, hot chocolate has been overshadowed by the likes of coffee and tea, despite the fact that it is clearly the superior choice. Don't believe me? Let me lay out the facts for you.First of all, hot chocolate is delicious. It's rich, creamy, and chocolatey, with just the right amount of sweetness. Coffee and tea, on the other hand, are bitter and acidic, and no amount of sugar or cream can mask the awful taste.Second, hot chocolate is good for you. Chocolate, the main ingredient in hot chocolate, is packed with antioxidants and other nutrients that can help boost your mood, improve your cognitive function, and even lower your risk of heart disease. Coffee and tea, on the other hand, can have negative effects on your health, such as increased anxiety and heart palpitations.Finally, hot chocolate is versatile. You can drink it hot or cold, spiked or non-alcoholic, and even add in flavorings like peppermint or cinnamon to mix things up. Coffee and tea, on the other hand, are boring and one-dimensional.So there you have it, folks. Hot chocolate is the best beverage in the world, and anyone who says otherwise is a fool. Don't be one of those fools ‚Äì start drinking hot chocolate today and taste the difference for yourself.Long live hot chocolate!Steven bonnell aka Destiny¬†",1617,274,0.9812,0.095,0.732,0.173

But every time, these dipshits think they have a kill shot by implying that killing someone who is asleep is identical to terminating a 3 week pregnancy.

7262,Destiny,"Thomistic Proofs for God- Any thoughts? A) The First Way: Motion1. All bodies are either potentially in motion or actually in motion.2. ""But nothing can be reduced from potentiality to actuality, except by something in a state of actuality"".3. Nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality in the same respect.4. Therefore nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality with respect to motion5. Therefore nothing can move itself; it must be put into motion by something else.6. If there were no ""first mover, moved by no other"" there would be no motion.7. But there is motion.8. Therefore there is a first mover, God.B) The Second Way: Efficient Cause1. Nothing is the efficient cause of itself.2. If A is the efficient cause of B, then if A is absent, so is B.3. Efficient causes are ordered from first cause, through intermediate cause(s), to ultimate effect.4. By (2) and (3), if there is no first cause, there cannot be any ultimate effect.5. But there are effects.6. Therefore there must be a first cause for all of them: God.C) The Third Way: Possibility and Necessity1. ""We find in nature things that are possible to be and not to be:"" contingent beings.2. Everything is either necessary or contingent.3. Assume that everything is contingent.4. ""It is impossible for \[contingent beings\] always to exist, for that which can not-be at some time is not.""5. Therefore, by (3) and (4), at one time there was nothing.6. ""That which does not exist begins to exist only through something already existing.""7. Therefore, by (5) and (6), there is nothing now.8. But there is something now!9. Therefore (3) is false.10. Therefore, by (2), there is a necessary being: God.D) The Fourth Way: Gradation1. There is a gradation to be found in things: some are better (hotter, colder, etc.) than others.2. Things are X in proportion to how closely the resemble that which is most X.3. Therefore, if there is nothing which is most X, there can be nothing which is good.4. It follows that if anything is good, there must be something that is most good.5. ""Therefore there must also be something which is to all beings the cause of their being, goodness, and every other perfection; and this we call God"".E) The Fifth Way: Design1. We observe that natural bodies act toward ends.2. Anything that acts toward an end either acts out of knowledge, or under the direction of something with knowledge, ""as the arrow is directed by the archer.""3. But many natural beings lack knowledge.4. ""Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God""",2617,443,0.9824,0.042,0.862,0.097

It would imply that people who are against this are against respecting peoples' marriage, and I mean if you're in the liberal worldview yeah this is true, but does it really need to be put like that?This is just a discussion about naming laws and when stuff like this is or isn't unhelpfully inflammatory, I hope this doesn't turn into polemical reddit-whatever debates about which people are the bad people.

Fast forward 6 years into my professional career and not only is my field saturated as fuck with mediocre field growth, I'm not really getting all that much enjoyment from work, and I'm also not invested enough to return for a Masters/PhD in mechanical engineering.I'm heavily considering transitioning into IT Security/Analyst or Web Development and was wondering if I genuinely need to apply for a Masters program at a university or if a bootcamp will yield similar results for a fraction of the cost. So if anyone has any insight into why one would be better than the other, experience with graduates from either, or any alternatives. Before the memes start, I'm not looking to take a 6 week part time course and expect to make $180k at Google. I just want to be more engaged with my work in a field with higher prospects, while capitalizing on the background I've already slightly started on.If you made it this far, my coding experience is Matlab and R console, which I know is more math intensive that C++, Python, etc. but I'm told basic understanding of syntax carries over pretty well.Thank you!",1673,290,0.9832,0.016,0.872,0.112

7356,Destiny,"DGG China Briefing #3 Briefing #1, Briefing #2Sources in the top comment. This one will be a bit longer, it's been a while.***Protests***In November, the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou was shook by more protests, flaring up after Foxconn recruited new workers to fill the gap caused by the walkout in October with promises of bonuses and higher wages, and then unilaterally changed the contracts. Additionally new workers lived with current ones, causing new ones to be designated as close contacts or even test positive, possibly preventing them from moving elsewhere after bridging the gap in unemployment or meeting their family for the spring festival in the following year.Police forcefully suppressed the protests.MemeFoxconn got a hold of protests, promising cash boni for workers and letting them leave the factory, even offering transport it seems. Mr. Wenzhao points out that the manufacturing industry‚Äôs contribution to the overall economy is dropping faster in China than in other industrialized countries, possibly signaling a wave of unemployment as part of recession due to the strong relationship between the manufacturing sector and jobs created in logistics and the service industry.**Personal opinion incoming**In the past weeks, protests against covid measures and the regime have spread across China, mainly driven by students and people that had been locked into their homes for extended periods of time, lacking food, water, and an income to provide for themselves. I think it is safe to say that the dissatisfaction of Chinese citizens has reached unprecedented levels, even if it might not necessarily bring the change, or change to the degree that one might wish for. To be clear, the scale and organization of these protests is relevant historically, this probably being the biggest, most organized protest since 89, but is far from significant enough to enable any real change in society or the system. More relevant, in my opinion, is the signal it sends to the citizens that feel the same way, and to us. People have been pushed past their endurance, and this marks a turn in the relationship between the government and the people. The compromise between sacrifice of freedom for material gain might have expired, the young generation is old enough to formulate demands, the ‚ÄúLower class‚Äù is at its limit due to covid measures, unable to sustain a livelihood, and the government has failed to react in any capacity.The abrupt outburst can be attributed to two factors. First, despite the 20 improved zero covid measures, that sparked hope of gradual opening, measures have been and are tightening in many cities, destroying the last hope of many people for an improvement of the situation. In addition, a fire in Urumqi killed 10 residents (according to official reports), which was understood by many to be a direct result of the tight measures in Urumqi hindering rescue personnel to properly manage the situation.The protests have been coined the ‚ÄúWhite Paper/Sheet Revolution‚Äù, as many protesters are holding up blank sheets of paper resembling the censorship and inability to voice concerns.This twitter account (Mandarin) reports on stuff that cannot be reported on within the country, received and is receiving video material and information by Chinese citizens involved in the protests daily, was posting by the minute when it started.***Covid***A conference with experts on the subject of the covid measures took place, allowing them to bring up their perspective and recommendations for the measures. Up until now, experts were either not involved in measures or were secondary to political motives, especially regarding Omicron. Mr Wenzhao correctly points out the phrase zero covid does not appear in the report above, while the lower fatality of Omicron, higher vaccination rates and learning effects of the past years are said to bring about a new form of prevention, endorsing the scientific perspective of said experts. This marks a noticeable change in communication. The Twitter account mentioned above also leaked a recently gone viral audio file ( of a teacher in Sichuan allegedly sharing plans of utilizing the school as grounds to perform a herd immunity experiment meant to be pushed to the rest of the country. This article reports on it, but of course the legitimacy of the recording is not confirmed.Another one of Mr Wenzhao‚Äôs takes I want to share: There is still no reason to believe that this will bring about the significant change that is wanted and needed. He compares the actions taken to easing your belt a bit after eating too much, which is not a bad thing for the people without income and livelihood but is also not a huge deal when looking at the bigger picture. 10 new improved covid measures have been published and are being implemented The most relevant changes are:1) The scope of lockdowns is now limited to a maximum of one building, preventing local governments from shutting down whole districts.2) Health QR codes will only be checked to enter i.e. kindergartens, nursing homes, retirement homes etc.3) Only high-risk workers have to keep providing test results to attend workStuff to keep in mind: Lockdowns are dependent on diligence of district personnel when checking temperatures, demanding tests, and reporting results, technically you might still end up in a locked down district if every building gets screwed by somebody testing positive. As testing is also reduced, this is pretty unlikely though.No comprehensive list of ‚Äúhigh risk jobs‚Äù is available.Close contacts, counter to previous expectations, still have to quarantine 5 days but can choose to do so in their home.After beginning to open up since last Wednesday, cases are surging (continuing a previous trend) and China‚Äôs healthcare system is facing significant challenges this winter, which is going to take a toll on the population. Lack of preparation in the years of the pandemic and focus on other measures like mass testing lead up to the current situation, where neither keeping the lockdowns, nor opening up seems to be sustainable.***Xi Jin Ping***On the 7th of December, the yearly conference of the central committee of the CCP, moderated by Xi himself, was held. Noticeably, neither the ten improved covid regulations, nor anything about the White Paper Revolution was mentioned.I will share some of Mr Wenzhao‚Äôs analysis here regarding Xi Jin Ping‚Äôs political nature and his reaction, it‚Äôs a big chunk of this video, so I won‚Äôt go ahead and timestamp everything but the beginning of the segment and take a shot at a summary.Xi is tied into the Zero Covid policy, it being a personal project of his closely linked to his agenda, making it almost impossible to logically separate him from the responsibility for it. At the same time, the White Paper Revolution and the protests clearly signal the failure of the policy in the eyes of the people, making it a de-facto failure politically speaking. From the notice on the conference and past events, Mr Wenzhao infers the following.While there is no mention of the protests or the adjusted regulations, notice is given on action that will be taken against corruption, namely within the testing industry, which is large and has been thriving in China due to the measures. Given the nature of China‚Äôs system and history, a pretty significant amount of corruption is basically guaranteed to exist in that area, so the move makes sense. At the same time, the bigger priority is likely to shift blame to bureaucratic figures for messing up execution of the zero covid policy and misrepresenting scope with false reports etc., achieving some decoupling between Xi and the policy in terms of responsibility.Related to this, the absence of any party speak on the protests in the notice, even in the form of roundabout finger points at foreign influence etc., in combination with the focus on inside corruption, signals that Xi perceives more danger within the bureaucratic body itself than the actual protests. This goes along with the notion of Xi stepping down and Li (Ke Qiang) replacing him before the 20th party congress and related camps within the party as well as Hu Jin Tao being escorted from the venue during the congress. Not mentioning the ten new covid regulations deepens the impression of a break between bureaucracy and political leadership.Learning from history, relevant historic references, and rituals are practices tied deeply into the fabric of the party and Chinese society, South-East Asia even, due to the major influence of Confucianism. In that fashion, Xi‚Äôs first action after the 20th party congress was to visitÂª∂ÂÆâ (Yan an), where the rectification movement of the CCP in 1942 originated, the first ideological mass movement of the Communist party, that would result in Mao‚Äôs cult of personality. This is a pretty clear indicator of Xi Jin Ping‚Äôs attitude towards the current state of the party and its internal affairs, calling for Êï¥È£é (rectification) before change can take place. (Putting the Chinese there because it carries more weight as a concept in Chinese than just saying rectification, due to its historical implication).Reminder: This is the personal breakdown of an individual that I then summarized, so there is room for further discussion and other perspectives. But especially the visit of Yan An is in my opinion objectively a pretty clear indicator of Xi‚Äôs perception and I think the analysis is pretty coherent.Thanks for reading, sorry for the length and lack of Economics, here is a short (15 min.), comprehensive segment on China‚Äôs current economic situation in case you‚Äôre interested in that.As always, thank you for reading.",9676,1567,0.9878,0.075,0.831,0.094

The gender wage gap today is more about being a mom than being a woman. Additionally, the most reliable predictor of someone's stance on abortion is their view on gender roles as opposed to a political party or religious status.I think those women Destiny spoke to realize that--even if they want to have a family--doing so will reduce their socioeconomic status, so they choose to be a ""career woman"" because that's the only path to equality.Basically, the role of a stay-at-home parent should not be degrading for men to step into, something I think Destiny's said before.

Regardless, I was not ‚Äútrolling‚Äù anyone my concerns about this were genuine .I will admit this whole situation got me to realize that these ‚Äúconspiracies‚Äù are not helpful especially to actual victims of child trafficking and such, im a CSA Survivor and I let both my personal rage and some political partisanship get in the way of actually researching how to help (no excuse just being honest).  I acknowledge that now I also acknowledge xanderhal was getting alot of hate and trolls, and his audience probably thought to lump me in with them.Ultimately hes free to block whoever he wants, and in hindsight I would‚Äôve not replied the way  did to his quote tweet. In the moment I was annoyed that I was saying things about this for days in his mentions, then when I mention hes ignoring people with genuine criticism, he assumes im talking about his reasons for burning the shoe0nhead bridge, even though thats counter to what I‚Äôve been saying for days. I expressed the same concerns in his streams it gets ignored, In hindsight I think i was too focused on balenciaga and their response to that as I mentioned in an earlier paragraph.

I focused too much on balenciaga, but I think there is still a point to be made with my concern, that this downplaying and lack of a strong stance against it will fuel ‚Äúgroomer‚Äù allegations against the lgbtq community.I know theres hateful people on the right who place the blame on the entire community, theres also those on the right who don‚Äôt (of course I realize the argument at that point is  they‚Äôll stand with those people though)But by not atleast explaining the bad and good things with balenciaga and why the weird ad happened in a way that doesnt come across as downplaying, ou are giving more fuel to the right against the community. Granted plenty of people on the right will hate people like myself anyways. (And id imagine even moreso for those more politically opposed) thats shitty, and it shouldn‚Äôt happen. I think shoe was irresponsible for not addressing the narrative when someone she followed it toook it out of hand against all lgbt people.

I have unfortunately come to the conclusion that, at least past a certain level of development, it is impossible to change one's sexual orientation. I have begun to wonder if I may have been able to turn myself gay, or at least bi, at an earlier stage in life; I remember a time in 7th grade where I jacked off to gay porn for like a month straight, and I think I developed a crush on a male friend of mine at the time as well. It wasn't even the sex part of the porn that I really liked; it was just the dudes kissing.Eventually those feelings passed however, and I have been unable to tap into them again at any point since. I have heard from browsing trans communities that some previously lesbian trans women have developed an attraction to men after taking prog; however, I don't want to stick female hormones up my butt, and I would also like to remain a man, so this option is closed to me. If any of you have any advice or suggestions for further experimentation, I would be open to hearing them. For now, however, I fear I must accept that I am straight and must plan accordingly.

IDK about proof that the DNC 100% knew it was real, but it's pretty clear that left wing media had a hyper specific narrative that it **was,** not just assumed or as a cautious suggestion, Russian disinfo ( pretty meme-y but it still illustrates the point). Biden himself even seemed to suggest pretty clearly that it was a ""Russian Plant""  I don't think it's a stretch to consider/suggest that as soon as the laptop story came out, Biden and team pretty much knew it was legit (either immediately or shortly thereafter), and the marching orders with regard to rhetoric were waterfalled to the rest of the Democrat members and left-wing media communicators. I understand the desire from Twitter to be cautious upfront, but it's hard for me to give grace and good-faith to the DNC given the narrative lasted so long. I can't imagine it would take all that long for the US government to verify a specific claim about the Presidents son - certainly a shorter amount of time than it took for the rhetoric to shift or the censorship of the story to disappear. And yet the rhetoric continued well past the election.",1376,241,0.9866,0.033,0.824,0.142

Cuz spending 90% of my time browsing reddit and playing shitty videogames feels more like it falls into the soul-sucking waste of time category but what else is there to do. I tried reading books instead but tbh most books are dogshit and not worth reading. Same with movies and TV shows. I thought music was pretty cool for a while so I listened to it a lot and even tried making some myself but at a certain point every song kinda sounds the same and it really loses its magic pretty fast. I also tried smoking weed, met a guy off grindr (I'm not gay just made an account to buy drugs) to buy it from and met behind a mcdonalds at 3 AM and almost crashed my car on the way back and tbh it was kinda mid. So now I have a bunch of weed I dont even wanna smoke. I know a guy who paints miniatures but that sounds like the most cucked loser shit in the world. Even coming from a guy who browses reddit and plays videogames. I know this subreddit jerks off to rock climbing but the fuck is the point. Wowee I climbed a bunch of fucking rocks. I am now living life to the fullest and am a perfect, contented person. I used to run track in high school and I used to go to the gym but physical exertion is not the magical cure to boredom and discontentment people on reddit think it is. So I quit both so I could spend more time on reddit instead. I guess you could be like destiny and become a sex addict but I wouldnt know what thats like. I'm just trying to find a good hobby that fills the time between work/school but doesn't feel like it's wasting that time. ",1679,331,0.9186,0.1,0.764,0.136

Ok, but I believe this is just going just a smidge too far. ""if you feel that feminine go get a boyfriend"" (paraphrase). Really?

Dwarf Fortress's new, enhanced game is out on Steam..IGN: 10/10 ""masterpiece""A game that I've tried and set aside multiple times for nearly a decade, Dwarf Fortress has long been an enigma to me. On paper, it sounds like the perfect game for someone like me; immersive management sim, deep mechanics, and assumes you're not retarded.Yet, for anyone who has ever tried Dwarf Fortress, you'll probably sympathize with the irony that these admired qualities in the game were the exact things that drove me away from it initially - featuring a learning curve so steep that the toll of the climb outweighed the eventual view I'd be able to enjoy from the top of the mountain. Well my friends - happy to say that D.F.'s new release on Steam is WAY more approachable than its ASCII predecessor. Still difficultStill requires a bit of googling to understand some of its mechanicsBut playing it this past week has helped me finally scratch the surface of the hype that I've heard so much about. The graphics, while better than the original, still leave a lot to be desired, but considering the depth of the simulation (actions, personalities, desires, lore throughout the world being generated every tick, etc.), I think that any further visual upgrades would make it the late-game unplayable for most computers.

7490,Destiny,"One thing came to mind about the Tate talk with Annalicia When Anna showed the video of Tate using Psychological manipulation to make a woman feel bad, Destiny rebutted with the ""women do it too"" take. Which is true but needs to be looked at more closely.  This is a little off topic but the power dynamic is similiar: With bigger men having physical threatening attributes, smaller people tend to compensate on psychological dark triad. When women are abused, they may project their behavior with the traits as well - acting even sociopathic. But it comes from a different place: When Tate does it, he has the power and wants to keep a hold of it. When a woman does it (sorry for the generalizations in my language, I get the nuance and how roles can be switched etc.) it is more of a cry for help, a coping mechanism. They may both be wrong but they definitely are not the same thing usually. And yes, women can also hold the power in the relationship and be manipulative.

7509,Destiny,"""Why do you care so much about X?"" is the soyest possible thing you could say about a topic that's popular in a place. This is the ""what does this have to do with Joe Rogan?"" response that is extremely common on the Joe Rogan subreddit and is mostly used whenever right wingers are getting dogpiled justifiably. And it's exactly what I'm seeing in response to the Musk posts here.Ironically, ""why do you care about X"" isn't what one typically says when something unimportant is being blown out of proportion. I and many others think the ""Twitter files"" have been mostly a nothingburger. There's nothing worth caring about contained within them, *and yet* I am never tempted to say ""why do you care so much about the Twitter files?"" to right wingers who are currently cumming in their pants over them. I know why people care about them and I can zero in on points of discussion from that starting point.""But it's annoying to see Elon Tweets over and over,"" as though this is the only time a specific topic has dominated the front page of a subreddit. Most of us don't respond with these self righteous ""this topic isn't relevant enough to be discussed"" retorts when shit we don't care about takes center stage. I give negative zero shits about most of the drama arcs that happen in the DGGsphere and I'm never tempted to say ""why do you care about this and it's an aberration that it's being discussed because I find it uninteresting"".Whenever ""why are you obsessed with X"" gets used it really comes across as ""I kind of like the thing or think it's not as bad as some people are saying, but can't really explain why.""Elon discourse is popular because some people have talked about the man as though he's literally God for at least 6 or 7 years at this point, and it's cathartic to watch him unravel in a way that's increasingly difficult for his fanboys to defend. If you need a direct connection to Destiny or DGGsphere in order to see why he's relevant (which I don't think you need, what's relevant is just whatever the user base wants to talk about), he's wading more and more into political topics that are popular here, and now owns one of the biggest social media platforms.

7523,Destiny,"A new morality/ethics-focused indie Steam game for people interested in complex decision-making. Full disclosure, I'm a game developer looking to share something I've been working on. For most video games, this subreddit would be a poor place to try and show off one's work. While a lot of Destiny fans are obviously gamers, the audience at large is mostly interested in philosophy and politics, and the overwhelming majority of games don't engage players on that level. Video games that challenge industry conventions are as rare as they are compelling, and I've made it my business to deliver morally complex and thematically rich products which unapologetically experiment with the medium. If you're the type of person who likes to contemplate complex moral quandaries, or if you're looking for a new, visceral survival experience that can challenge both your ethics and view of life? I'd like to proudly introduce you to Yuma Will Burn.*Yuma  Will Burn is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.*As  a developer, I've taken a risk by dedicating so much time to a game of this type. The genre is VERY obscure and niche. I still did it though,  because I believe in both the artistic value of a deep and disempowering narrative experience and the unbridled passion this audience for them has.I encourage you to check out and wishlist the game with the link above.

Background: Hi, I‚Äôm a Center right Swede who has pretty much been antiwoke and persuaded by that side of the isle until I discovered this community and it‚Äôs sane people, so thank you! question: intersectionality is a tool to study how different groups interact from a power/oppression perspective where these groups intersect.I‚Äôve seen intersectionality been used by destiny as pretty much ‚Äúyou have to have a multifaceted analysis‚Äù where you don‚Äôt just consider one factor when judging if an individual should be considered more victimised than someone else.I‚Äôve also seen academics from the social sciences use it as a cudgel for a ‚Äúsocial Marxist‚Äù world view to justify pretty much what is ‚Äúthere a power imbalances in the world, white cis healthy men are at the top oppressing everyone else and sanctions against them is warranted due to this oppression‚Äù The first view of intersectionality seems necessary the other seems disgustingly racist/wrong/detrimental to me.

7647,Destiny,"SHORT EFFORTPOST] Why I think Steven is wrong about the IShowSpeed situation Anyone that has been up to date with the recent drama knows the clip that got Steven into trouble ([ The gist of his argument is that there is a somewhat new trend of streamers, particularly those that are black, of being loud and ""scream\ing\] at the camera"". My argument is similar to the following one that was posted on the LSF thread of the clip itself (clip is deleted but the comments remain): [ . The ""screaming at the camera"" routine is something that has been popular for a while now and, while it may be something that could have different regularities of presentation in different racial communities (not sure of this), it's not uncommon at all.The trend that is being seen on streaming platforms like Twitch or Youtube is that of very high-energy content creators ""screaming"" at the camera. This is easily summed up by the phrase ""Loud = Funny"", which has seen use for many years before this entire drama and got an Urban Dictionary entry in 2020 ( which suggests at least some use by then. Also, you got a random reddit thread using the same phraseology from 2021:  If we take a look at some of the largest context creators on Twitch and Youtube, we can see this trend quite clearly. Sodapoppin ( XQC( TimTheTatMan ( IShowSpeed ( KaiCenat ( among many others. The algorithm knows what it wants. High-energy, somewhat loud, sometimes angry content is what people want to see and it seems to be doing quite well. Are there many communities that don't follow this trend? Absolutely. However, when we're talking about people who have demographics that are on the younger side, this seems to be a more absolute trend with very few exceptions. IShowSpeed in particular is ""guilty"" of this. I haven't consumed much of his content, but most of his more popular youtube videos follow the behavior before with very clear markers for what I call ""young person racism"". This is essentially the ""edgy equals funny"" version of the trend where kids think that saying racial slurs makes for good content. A highly viewed video (17 million views)  of his getting woken up by videos his chat donates while they spam racial slurs in chat is not uncommon. Many communities have gone for this kind of audience before with a lot of social repercussions; think of the entire CX community. The money is there and some can exploit it more easily than others depending on factors like time, place, and, of course, race.Steven has mentioned before that he doesn't watch many streams so I wouldn't be totally surprised if he has missed a lot of these trends and, considering the makeup of some of the highest viewed streamers on Youtube and Twitch being people that appeal to younger audiences ( I'm not surprised he came away with this opinion. Obviously, I have my criticism of his behavior: just like he's said on stream, I believe he's overgeneralizing a social trend to box in a very common practice to a particular group of people that may not necessarily be completely involved in it. Considering how few streams he consumes, I think that commentary on the trends of streaming isn't something he should be talking about right now. He seems to be more involved in youtube algorithm trends and maybe trends on Twitter where I assume he's gotten a lot of the clips that formed his opinion. Hopefully the situation doesn't blow up more than it already has but who knows.",3436,600,0.9716,0.05,0.871,0.08

I see it in this sub but also in the world in general. There's 8 billion people. Almost nothing is 100% between all humans besides like ""needs oxygen""Its implied to not ""be all"" by the virtue of common sense. Generalizations are called Generalizations because they are generally true. It's really annoying when someone makes a claim that's generally true and someone goes ""well acktually its not in this specific scenario""One example is females and having children. If you say females (let's not bring trans stuff into this. That's why I said female and not woman) can have children you'll get people who said dumb shit like ""my sister can't have children is she not a female""Which is a stupid as fuck statement because it's generally true outside of rare abnormalities.Or something like ""men like to solve problems instead of talking about emotions all the time"" Obviously it's not all.Or even a few years ago when women were talking about their problem with men and tons of men replied with dumb stuff like ""not all men""Yes... duh. That is obvious and implied by common sense. It just like any ability to use your brain when you feel the need to point out something ""isn't all"" We know.",1321,228,0.5804,0.131,0.711,0.159

Hacker News is built with it and Naughty Dog uses it as a scripting language (it‚Äôs easily embedded in C/C++ programs). More importantly, you‚Äôll learn a lot of good practices.Racket is a dialect of LISP/Scheme(kinda like what C++ is to C). LISP/Scheme and it‚Äôs descendants are massively influential. The Scheme wiki says it‚Äôs influenced JavaScript, Python, and Rust:  In a nutshell, LISP is the first functional programming language which is a technique most mainstream languages have been moving towards. The LISP syntax is different than C based languages so learning it early is great. You‚Äôll get familiar with functional practices and become much more based than people like me who learned them later. Racket also has all the tools you need to start making cool shit. Gui, graphics, web server, you name it. All with great documentation to get you going. Once you have a handle on it, check out Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ( It‚Äôs one of the best CS books ever and you can use Dr.Racket with  #lang sicp ( to follow along.You have a great opportunity with this class.

They believe that people with horrifically painful disabilities/illnesses/diseases should be forced to remain alive in a state of constant suffering against their will. I would argue that there are some people with disabilities that have an even worse quality of life than the average child sex slave. Sure, it would be certainly be unpleasant to be raped, but it is probably still better than enduring a life where you are in extreme agony every moment of every day due to a disability/illness/disease.Therefore, I think its reasonable to say that someone who opposes the right of a disabled person to end their suffering is actually far more evil than someone who opposes the right of a child sex slave to escape the captivity of their rapist.

I can understand some disparity as we like steven and think highly of him but dear Moses the difference between Steven and Hasan or Vaush is like heaven and earth.when someone slings shit Steven Slings back. it's how he would ideally act from the countless times he said that's how he enjoys doing it. if someone wants to have a civil argument Steven isn't gonna start screaming at them and otherwise of someone is acting bad faith, screaming, lying and being an asshole then Dman would just love to respond with the same energy.but the problem comes when this community then suddenly jumps up and says (in soy nerd voice) ""ahhh Destiny why did you say that that was uncalled for and you should have thunk about the ooooptics"". no stfu when Hasan says a big part of DGG are just racists steven can fire back at him saying he visited a sex slave brothel. or he can say he hopes vaush fucking dies because **FUCK THEM**yes fuck them, these pisses of shit do nothing but leech and virtue signal their entire careers while shitting on lying about and just acting like babies about anything related to Steben (keneth bonell 2nd aka destiny aka steven the swastica bonnel).and no one ever holds them to the same standard as they supposedly hold him to, that we hold for him and that normal people would hold for anyone in this situation.and the final point is. why do people do it? why do people have this crazy high standard of Steven and they go after him for every little pip he says while Hasan, vaush, Kcent, speed etc can say whatever wild shit they want but no one cares.  part of it is the views, yes. they are really big and fellow streamers want to stay friendly. but we also see the same behavior in the small lefty content creators. people like Lemon Mama, Loe, P Lunday, Lerric etc.Stevon was much bigger then all of them yet they had no problem shitting on him, lying and saying whatever crazy shit to smear him. the thing is that Steven does not have dominance. Density is *unthreatening.* on the online space these crazy leftists can cancel you, they can bully you, they can do whatever manner of nasty things they want to knowing they will not ever receive a ""punishment"" for their actions.and Cuban Man here constantly emphasizes (a thing he was much stronger on this in the past) his policing of the community. how much he shackles the Daliban from actually being an internet terrorist organization.   we never do any hate raids, mobs, attacks that we do against anyone as a community. unlike the leftospheer who constantly weaponize their community. or people like hasan who just don't give a fuck about a stopping anything and he implicitly encourages his fans to attack others. meanwhile everyone just takes denosity's goodwill and good behavior as granted.so why wouldn't all these people shit on Destiny? they get everything and lose nothing. it's *safe* to fuck with Steven, but Hasan? oh well suddenly you find yourself blacklisted from any colabes with big streamers meanwhile Stalony doesn't act against you. (in regards to this point I'm glad he is changing, his 30 day ban for anyone hosting \[redacted\]s is a good step.)and this as always in my fucking stupid effort posts somehow goes back to Harry Potter and the methods of rationality. (what can you do when it's a better story then the bible) HPMOR chapter 105&gt;""Wolves, dogs, even chickens, fight for dominance among themselves. What I finally understood, from that clerk's mind, was that to him Lucius Malfoy had dominance, Lord Voldemort had dominance, and David Monroe and Albus Dumbledore did not. By taking the side of good, by professing to abide in the light, we had made ourselves unthreatening. **In Britain, Lucius Malfoy has dominance, for he can call in your loans, or send Ministry bureaucrats against your shop, or crucify you in the Daily Prophet, if you go openly against his will. And the most powerful wizard in the world has no dominance, because everyone knows that he is,"" Professor Quirrell's lips curled, ""a hero out of stories, relentlessly self-effacing and too humble for vengeance**.  &gt;  &gt;...  &gt;  &gt;It is all humble heroes like Dumbledore.

Frodo and Samwise from Lord of the Rings did seem to match the archetype of a completely non-threatening hero.in conclusion, Dmonster knows better then you how to do this shit and you should think before you start soying out about ""the oooptics""",5309,920,-0.9775,0.156,0.705,0.139

7842,Destiny,"Why Stardust is Highly Based and NOT Pushing Back on Harmful Ideas can Constitute Responsible Platforming. I'll start with a quote to set the stage.  ‚ÄúIn reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself...I see with a myriad of eyes, but it is still I who see.‚Äù  ‚Äï **C.S. Lewis,** **An Experiment in Criticism** Recently, Destiny facilitated a discussion between several streamers concerning responsible platforming in the context of Stardust's controversial interviews with Richard Spencer. In this discussion, she was criticized for not pushing back on Richard Spencer's ideas but rather ""letting him speak."" This has been a common refrain in the discussion of responsible platforming, which I would argue is fundamentally a flawed criticism. The general position typically given on responsible platforming by individuals is usually that it is ok to platform people with ""dangerous"" or ""radical"" ideology if appropriate questions are asked and pushback is given. There are some farther left/right who would disagree with this. Typically, people end up on a spectrum where most would agree that some people should be de-platformed or not platformed by interviewers in all or some contexts (such as positively). However, the scope of who falls under this is hotly contested even among those with generally similar beliefs. There is a lot more that can be said about this debate in general, but I trust that people reading this have heard at least one or two decent debates on the topic so they understand the basics of the landscape.My own position on platforming is that in the vast vast majority of cases, de-platforming for ideological reasons (what someone believes) should not be a thing that happens. I am a genuine believer in the market place of ideas. However, I would go a step further in that not all platforming of radical or controversial ideologies needs to receive pushback in all specific circumstances. My arguments for this are built around 6 central tenants. 1.) Ideas must be understood well and in their most persuasive form to be argued against well or agreed with. a.) As a disclaimer when I say ""well"" and ""most"" I mean ""a good steal man comprehension"" and ""a generally good representation/ argument for the idea."" b.)  Ideas that are not in a good form with their best arguments lose their identity as that idea becomes something else the further it strays from its more persuasive form. Thus when you argue against a poor version of an idea you are not refuting the idea.c.) When the idea does come up in its truer form, people who have no exposure do not have the tools to comprehend it might be wrong. d.) If the idea is correct and the labels of ""radical"" or ""wrong"" have genuinely been miss-applied (and no I don't think that's the case for Spencer), than it's harmful to have a good idea be perceived as bad for reasons not relating to the ideas merits. 2.) Ideas are usually taught/ explained better by their disciples than by their detractors.a.) In general this seems fairly self-evident as explaining an idea you don't believe in requires a higher mark of rhetorical skill.b.) There is often a high motivation to make the idea you don't believe in seem worse even subconsciously. 3.) Pushback, while good in many (if not most) contexts can prevent ideas being shown in their best light. a.) While argument/pushback from an interviewer may have value in the vast majority of cases, it can often be important to see ideas from their disciples unfiltered/ uninterrupted to best understand them or why someone might believe them. We would say this for books. You can read a controversial or radical book without someone constantly butting in to tell you what is wrong about the book.  b.) Pushback if done poorly can obfuscate correct understanding of ideas. c.) If some ideas are only platformed with pushback or debate while others are not, it grants an unfair advantage to ideas that may popular at the time, but might also be bad. Imagine for example that racism is really popular in a particular society and that whenever anti-racism is platformed, it is always done so in the context of debate or pushback. This would grant an inherent advantage to a bad idea over a good. A fundamental belief in the a liberal market place of ideas requires not only ideas be platformed but they have some sense of being platformed in non-universally negative light. 4.) Platforming, pushback, and arguments must be taken in aggregate with an appreciation for diversity of style and method. a.) Things like ""arguments,"" ""pushback,"" and criticism are never a part of a single event. They are always part of a giant conversation. Take the example of today. Many criticisms of Spencer were levied from Destiny and friends after his interview with Stardust. These form a larger whole that cannot be seen only as unique events. In the same way, Kanye's interview with Alex Jones really can't be just seen as that interview. It is also part of a massive amount of conversation about the interview itself. b.) The strength of the market place of ideas isn't that an idea or concept may win out in a single event even though it is bad or even for a short period of time in aggregate. The concept is that over the long haul, good ideas will beat bad ones. I think the general improvement of the state of humanity and the beliefs of society over the past 20 years is good evidence for this. Think about what people believed in the 90's compared to now. It's easy to look at the world now and say people are crazy. However, in aggregate the lever has moved in a positive direction. c.) If non-confrontational or friendly interviews were the only way we saw a bad idea, this would be catastrophic. However, this is not the only light they are seen in. With diversity of content, comes huge varieties of platforming styles. Stardust's interview is just a tiny puzzle piece in a broader whole we engage in. It's generally taken for granted that people aren't convinced by single appearances or debates. It's the aggregate response that is listened to. 5.) The platforming style should be blind to the ideas themselves. This is to say that if someone like Stardust has a style of platform that she is pre-committed to engaging with, it is okay for her to stay consistent with that style for any ideas platformed. The same would be the case for Destiny. If he is having a debate, he should not have a debate because he is more sympathetic to an idea. His points may change, but style shouldn't necessarily a.) Ideas should be put in environments where the best ideas win. I think even someone who believed in radical de-platforming would agree with this. b.) If ideas are given exposure to the same kinds of platforms, in aggregate good ideas will triumph. The trouble with pre-determining good ideas and bad ones by people irrespective to a natural selection process, is that it can be pre-disposed to select for bad ideas. It just selects for what's popular without an ability to change peoples minds. Again it has to be asked ""what if the idea that's unpopular is good?"" 6.) There is some inherent good in enjoyable content, entertainment, and humora.) As a default, entertaining/enjoyable content is a good thing. I want that and it is my assumption that other people like content that they/ others enjoy. Thus things like humor or entertainment defaults to good, and the burden of proof is set against the side that wants to say they are bad. b.) If (a) is granted, and a large number of people enjoyed Stardust's content, it defaults to good. This means that a measured harm generated by such content must be shown to supersede this not just exist. c.) I don't think there is any way that this can be shown. Additionally, the harm from ""irresponsible platforming"" like this is genuinely insufficient to hurdle a burden of proof barrier of the entertainment people get from it. This is particularly true when taken in aggregate with a laissez faire approach to platforming. I think a buy in to liberal ideology and democracy at large requires a semi-blind approach to the platforming of the vast majority of ideas. This includes platforming styles. Not just whether or not people are platformed. The question ends up in the same ""who decides who is de-platformed"" place. It should be noted that this extends beyond policies and organizations to influential podcasters and streamers. We all have a role to play on forwarding general human liberal ideology and its continued successes despite the costs.  The quote at the beginning refers more specifically to fiction, but I think it applies here to. It's good to see a myriad of characters and ideas in different lights. It's also good to see ideas in a variety of places, presented in a variety of ways.",8785,1507,0.9988,0.1,0.735,0.164

People like this guy are actual worthless evil pieces of shit who should have their video equipment confiscated by their government, as they pose an actual public mental health risk.If ever the male incel suicide rate were to skyrocket it's content creators like this that will play the biggest part as they fill the minds of young men with this pathological hopeless depressive worldview.

I was watching an older video with Max and Erudite and I wanted to point out a few things of where he's used similar patterns of manipulation in multiple interactions. I know this is an older video but I thunk it have some important points and I haven't see it before today.Here's the video:My analysis:Max loves framing everything in the judgemental role. Making him the authority figure in the father / child relationship; He's feels like the shitty father (he's used this with lav as well). Then he gives an example of how he would cause his father to get mad at him even though he feared being screamed at, to show how erudite does it to max. Once again painting the father/child relationship.The whole frame of the conversation is around him judging Erudites behaviour, and why he sees her in this way. Nothing is about how max behaves (Unless it futher puts him in a judge role), because max is the father, always.This is a highly manipulative domination tactic, the more I see max the closer I lean towards him having apsd.His long looks at the camera, stoic stare, and even holding back tears when he's feigning emotion are all well crafted to futher the archetype of the father or judge. @notsoeruditeI see Erudite accept the child role I'm this interation, because of her psychology background I have to assume she does so knowingly, to extract more information about max's intentions.If we're getting meta I think max sees this and this is why he keeps talking about her having one hand on the wheel and how this is ""bad"" and stops her from experiencing their true relationship. Again classic manipulative tactic and way of breaking down her boundaries.The more I watch the more I see Max exposing his hand.""If you give me control, I will protect you from being hurt by me"". ""...this will be better for you emotionally and professionally..."" Clear manipulation.""Because of you I've changed how I stream""Max to Erudite is identical to...""Lav I left Stevens orbit for you"".Max to Lav.What does everyone else think?",2089,357,0.6583,0.086,0.819,0.095

8018,Destiny,"The Chinese and the Jews: Similarities between two very different groups of people While many people know about the last century of antagonism against the Jews, not many really know the extent to which the Jews were persecuted before the Holocaust. Similarly, not many know the extent of persecution the Chinese experienced in many places over the last two centuries. The comparison between the Chinese and the Jews has been made before. In 1914 King Vajiravudh of Thailand published a newspaper article calling the Chinese ‚ÄúThe Jews of the Orient‚Äù, and that they had excessive ""racial loyalty and astuteness in financial matters,"" as well as ""Money is their God. Life itself is of little value compared with the leanest bank account."". These criticisms seem in line with anti-semitic remarks by‚Ä¶ virtually anyone in the last century. Why? Why were the Chinese seen like this? Why are the Jews seen like this? Both of these questions have books about them. I‚Äôm not going to write another one, but I‚Äôll try and briefly highlight some key ideas and points. *Introducing: The Chinese among Others*Chinese Ethnic Groups:The place names are in Chinese, which is not going to be super helpful for a lot of people who don‚Äôt speak Chinese - but - I want to point to Fujian and Guangdong provinces, which are on the mainland across from Taiwan. They are inconveniently for my argument not labelled as any particular ethnic group, but there are 3 groups that come from these provinces that are important:**The Hakka:** Basically a series of groups of people who fled Northern China and went to Southern China, fleeing persecution. They have their own dialect and customs etc, but importantly they‚Äôre not really a ‚Äúgeographic group‚Äù - they‚Äôre not really like ‚Äúthe Celts‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Swiss‚Äù or some group that has been there for ages. Hakka means ‚Äúguest‚Äù, and they arrived in the southern provinces as ‚Äúguests‚Äù. **The Hoklo:** Hokkien is the Cantonese name for Fujian province (opposite Taiwan). Even before China was forcibly opened up by the Opium Wars, people from this area would travel all over Southeast Asia setting up little villages, trading with people and establishing networks. When Chinese ports in the south really got going, the Hoklo began to travel all across the region. They settled in Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and of course, Taiwan. After decades of pseudo-integration they became ethnic minorities in all these places. **The Wenzhounese:** Wenzhou is a city in Fujian province. The city is surrounded by mountains, and has a long history of trade. During the Maoist era, the Wenzhounese were forbidden to trade, but often did it anyway. In the 70s and 80s, loads of them began to move to Europe, especially Italy, where they got involved in the textiles and catering industries. Many have become very successful entrepreneurs and businessmen across France, Italy and Germany. There is a striking commonality between these groups and the Jews. The Jews also had a diaspora, also were keen traders, also set up trading posts and villages across the world, also leveraged family networks, also were keen financiers. And, as we shall see, both groups suffer similar fates. *Introducing: Three Thousand Years of Solitude*Have a look at the history of persecution of the Jews. It begins in 740 BCE (which is honestly nothing special, the Jews carried out their own atrocities against all sorts of people in the biblical times) and, as the sources get better (and centralised authority becomes stronger) starting from around 1000, starts to **ramp up**. By the time we get to the 1800s we‚Äôre getting about 5 - 10 events per decade. These events range from forced conversion to slaughter to confinement in certain places. This happened a lot. Everywhere. In England the Jews were occasionally rounded up and taken out to the English Channel, where at low tide there would be spits of land. They would be left on these to drown. In the 1000 and 1100s the Jews in England were forced to keep the King‚Äôs financial documents (as they made most of the loans to the Crown). So when the King wanted to have debts disappear, he would order the Jews of Winchester, or Windsor, or wherever, to be killed. In Russia, Catherine the Great in the 1700s ordered the Jews to all be moved to the Pale of Russia (Ukraine, now) and for them to pay excess tax. In Rome, one of the first forms of rent control in the world was for the Jews: a Pope decided they were a useful asset and provided stable accommodation for them in a ghetto (an Italian word). The Jews here were annually taken from the ghetto and ridden by Italian soldiers; when they left the ghetto women had to wear a yellow veil (usually reserved for prostitutes) to identify them; the chief rabbi every year had to petition the Chief of the Councillors to let them live there another year, and the price was a kick to the bottom; they weren‚Äôt allowed to build property anywhere outside the ghetto, so built upwards, creating constant plagues. The Jews were **despised**. In North Africa, they were constantly raided, enslaved, murdered or mutilated. In Eastern Europe, they were subject to endless pogroms. In Western Europe, they were forced into ghettoes, supplied loans and were regularly slaughtered. My point is that the Holocaust **was not actually anything new - it was merely the last, and most coordinated, attempt at the destruction of the Jews** (and loads of others but I‚Äôm not focusing on them here). *Anti-Chinese Sentiment: ‚ÄúThey must be eliminated and destroyed down to the roots‚Äù*The Chinese faced very similar pogroms across the world, but there were fewer of them; they had less time to settle and the fact that they could sometimes return to China meant that they were often less precariously situated than the Jews. These pogroms were across the world, but concentrated more in the 19th and 20th centuries. The US had an anti-Chinese exclusion law from 1882 - 1892. Canada and Mexico had anti-Chinese riots and massacres; Australia and the US had riots and massacres. France has had anti-Chinese attacks as recently as 2016. But nowhere were these protests and massacres as bad as in South-east Asia.Anti-Chinese pogroms have been a regular occurrence in SEA, but the biggest were in the 60s in Indonesia; between 500,000 - 1,000,000 people died, many of whom were targeted because of being of Chinese heritage or ethnicity. In 1969, anti-Chinese riots in Malaysia erupted and rioters roamed the streets shooting people who looked Chinese. *Why were the Jews despised? Why were the Chinese?*The Jews were not allowed to own land - or hold virtually any profession, and Christians were not allowed to loan money **to other Christians**. Importantly, Jews were allowed to loan money (with interest) to Christians. Thus they began to get involved in banking. In addition, the Jews had a strong network throughout Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Asia Minor (Turkey etc). They were often expelled from Europe, but often were allowed to exist more freely in Arab states. They therefore had strong trading networks, where a family member in Constantinople might arrange to have something sent or received by a family member in Granada. This allowed safer trading than trading with non-family members. The Chinese - especially the Hoklo - had the same setups. They would have family members across the region, in the Philippines and Java and Bangkok and of course, back in Fujian. There were Hakka mines in Indonesia and these would send money across the sea to Taiwan. The Chinese railway workers in America often would send money home.Both groups had language issues, and integration issues. Both groups were forced to live in specialised zones in their ‚Äúhost countries‚Äù. Both groups had different religions than the majority culture. The Chinese set up ‚Äúsecret societies‚Äù and ‚Äúnative place lodges‚Äù called ‚Äúhuiguan‚Äù which doubled as mutual aid organisations; the Jews had synagogues and other lodges where they were able to conduct religious rites, speak Yiddish and actually openly be Jewish. But‚Ä¶ when it was persecution time, these places were often the first to be set on fire. The Chinese and the Jews were often set against the ‚Äúcommon people‚Äù by rulers. The Kings of England would often encourage anyone who had loans with the Jews to gather together and with military support hang the Jews and burn the records. The colonial powers in Indonesia would pit the Chinese merchants and money-lenders against local people to weaken local authorities and become the only source of money or expertise on the island. Both Jews and the Chinese would often work for lower pay than locals, lowering pay for everyone. So: economic niches, manufactured antagonism, religious / cultural / language differences all played a role. But what has really cemented this, and still plays a big part today, is culture. The Chinese and the Jews have a few very advantageous cultural ideals:1. Family and traditional values. Both groups maintain their own culture when in the host country. They often have a different dialect, have specialist schools and have specialist cultural rites and religious practices. This brings them together more, and often creates situations where the family will stay very compact. Hiring a person who is your culture will often produce less friction than hiring someone of a different culture. 2. Education. Both groups place an enormous premium on education and educational attainment. Both groups place significant value on a few - very highly paid - roles: doctors, lawyers, banking, company ownership. Many other cultures, especially WASP cultures, have placed more emphasis on trade skills, working in a factory, working as a police officer or fireman or a soldier (‚Äújust like my father!‚Äù). The Jews and the Chinese don‚Äôt want to be cops or soldiers, they want to be lawyers and doctors. 3. Saving. Both groups have been precarious for a long time. Jews and the Chinese save a lot of money, and often have diversified assets. The Chinese often try to own their own homes and their own businesses. Both groups are very entrepreneurial, but also often save much more substantial portions of their wealth. Both groups also contribute to mutual aid associations frequently, meaning they can bounce back from hard times easily.All of these lead to holding positions of wealth and influence in our society. This exacerbates the other tensions, and leads to pogroms or riots. The cycle continues, and probably will continue, forever. Any group that is ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù and achieves disproportionate power will see this happen. When the colonial powers took over an area, they would often put an ethnic minority in charge. Almost without fail, when the powers left, the ethnic minority was left in a den of wolves, and would be torn apart. The Jews and the Chinese are a perennial example of this situation. The recent anti-semitism is a little late, but isn‚Äôt unusual. My great-grandparents came from the Pale of Russia after a particularly violent pogrom. My great-grandfather cut textiles with a great pair of scissors and spoke no English, only Yiddish. My grandfather got a phD and my father married a non-Jewish woman. I‚Äôve married a non-Jewish woman. Me or my children may be caught in a pogrom, but hopefully their children won‚Äôt be. Looking across thousands of years of pogroms, it seems like the Jews will only be safe when they aren‚Äôt Jewish anymore.",11466,1907,0.8989,0.075,0.842,0.083

I heard keel called hearth of the boat and other things so I think that keel is closest to something irreplaceable. Therefore the ship of Theseus is the same ship until the keel is replaced. Same goes for Sejin¬¥s question about sending parts (he asked this like two hours ago on the stream). The hypothetical goes like this: Theseus is sending his boat to someone one part at the time. When he goes to this person for a visit he sees that he build two boats from theese parts which one is his boat? According to my very limited knowledge of boats his boat is obviously the one with original keel.

Impunity for perpetrators of some human rights abuses was a continuing problem. More about that summary is in the state.gov link at the beginning of the sections / summary /.

From what I understand, evolution strives to make whatever advantages we develop as natural to us as possible. From a male perspective, evolution made sex feel good so that we would have a strong desire to continue having it and create babies. Evolution has also made it very easy for men to be sexually stimulated, so sexual pleasure feels very natural, which keeps men involved in it.But in order to even stand a chance of giving a woman sexual pleasure, you truly need to learn, acquire skill sets, and be knowledgeable in her field. Women's sexual pleasure does not feel like a natural occurrence at all and more like¬†something you have to work quite hard to accomplish. I suppose that's because it's not necessary for women to receive pleasure for¬†making babies, which is evolution's intended outcome, but isn't it a little dishonest to place the responsibility on men when it feels like evolution is mostly to blame in this situation?¬†Its easy to just say ""men are bad at sex"" but when you really think about it, if men need to be ""good"" at sex, our most primitive and biological imperative, just to satisfy women, doesn't that mean evolution kinda gave women the cold shoulder here?",1359,237,0.9976,0.058,0.64,0.302

On its face this may seem like a positive stereotype given that it‚Äôs generally seen as a compliment. However, for every black man with a big penis there are many other black men that are average. This stereotype can put a burden on black men that don‚Äôt fit the stereotype. Not only that, but this stereotype extends heavily into pornographic material. There are spaces within the porn industry that fetishize large black penises. The fetishization can be taken further when it comes to white women and black men as interracial porn often revolves around cuckold and BBC. Another ‚Äúpositive‚Äù stereotype is Asians being smart. Not just smart but hardworking, quiet, polite etc.. And while all those may sound like good stereotypes, it puts a burden on Asian individuals to act a certain way.In conclusion, stereotypes whether they seem good or bad are often harmful in ways we don‚Äôt recognize.",1206,200,0.8705,0.096,0.76,0.144

8129,Destiny,"Bestiality is one of the least harmful forms of animal abuse Destiny often discusses how most people have inconsistent positions on animal ethics. For instance, most lose their mind whenever someone gently fucks their dog in the ass. Yet many of these same people have no issue with the animal agriculture industry where animals are treated far less humanely. A dog who occasionally gets fucked in the ass by their owner has a MUCH better quality of life than most cows and pigs.There are of course some people (usually vegans) who hold the position that farming animals and fucking your dog in the ass are both bad. However, even most of these people have inconsistent views on animal ethics. Bestiality usually does harm animals, but it is often less harmful than many other types of animal abuse that even vegans consider acceptable.For instance, most vegans seem to think it is acceptable to force a horse to wear a saddle and carry some fat fuck on their back for several hours at a time (slavery) but they think its immoral to gently make love to a horse for a few minutes. Keep in mind that horses are able to handle getting fucked by horse cocks, which are far more girthy than that of a human. Therefore, it is hard to imagine that inserting a comparatively tiny human cock in a horse vagina would cause the animal much suffering. At worst, it would be slightly uncomfortable. I suspect that it is still far less uncomfortable than carrying people their back.Thoughts?",1477,258,-0.9924,0.212,0.733,0.055

8158,Destiny,"[Effortpost]Clearing up the Body Shaming Confusion. # IntroSo there has been a lot of back and forth on this recently. Some common talking points I see are:1. Saying ""small dick energy"" (SDE) is basically the same as saying ""you have a small dick""2. Saying ""SDE"" has nothing to do with body shaming because its about personality3. The people that are fine with using SDE are hypocrites and but aren't fine with body shaming are hypocrites.4. People that aren't fine with using SDE just want to get rid of all insults.I think that there is a way of looking at this that can provide an answer to all of these points and maybe build a common understanding.I think the reason there is such a disconnect on this topic is because of a few concepts:Implicit vs ExplicitLiteral vs FigurativeSocietal Understanding# Implicit vs ExplicitWhen most people think of insults, we think of a directly attacking a person based on a perceived flaw.* Example 1: Bully makes fun of a chubby kid by calling them a ""fatass"".In this case it can be said the chubby kid is explicitly being targeted.However, because the word itself implies being overweight is bad, it also implicitly targets anybody who is overweight by its nature. This is where the next concept comes into play.# Literal vs FigurativeWhile the word an insult uses can be directly tied to the ""perceived flaw"" it is attacking. It doesn't necessarily have to be. The word ""fatass"" can be directly tied to somebody's weight, but it can also be used to describe behavior.* Example 2: A person of average weight eats 2 slices of pizza at a party when they were only supposed to get one, the person who didn't get a slice calls them a ""fatass"".In this case, the word ""fatass"" is used not to describe the person's weight, but instead their actions, as being the explicit target. But these are not mutually exlusive. An insult can be considered both literal AND figurative if the target meets the conditions. Either way, because of the word ""fat"" is used, the word implicitly degrades anyone who is fat, even if that no longer applies to the explicit target. There is one way to change the implicit target of a word and that requires the next concept.# Societal UnderstandingWords only have meaning because society agrees on a meaning, because of this, words like ""cool"" go from being a description of temperature, ""The glass was cool to the touch"" to also being a description of personality/popularity, ""Daniel is the coolest dude I know"". This fluidity in meaning can apply  in 2 different ways.The first is a word losing the quality of an insult.* Example 3: A black person says to their friend, ""what up my N-ga""Even though the N-word is meant to implicitly degrade black people, the societal understanding of the word is that, when used by by black people, it essentially means ""dude/guy"". the second is an insult not being connected to the original subject* Example 4: A person calls their friend a ""pussy"" because they jumped after being scared.Even though pussy is connected to female anatomy, and it implies that a ""pussy"" or vagina is a negative thing, it is understood by society that the insult isn't connected to vaginas or, by extension, women. So while there CAN be an element of implicit shaming, society at large does not see it that way.# Addressing the ConflictSo using the concepts from before, I want to address the talking points put forth initially.**Saying ""small dick energy"" (SDE) is basically the same as saying ""you have a small dick""***SDE is a figurative insult. It is generally understood as ""you are insecure"". So the explicit target of the insult is the person's personality, not their body.***Saying ""SDE"" has nothing to do with body shaming because its about personality***SDE isn't completely divorced from the societal understanding that ""small dick = bad"", therefore even though it is implicitly understood as ""you are insecure"", it also implicitly targets small dick dudes and can be considered a form of implicit body shaming.***The people that are fine with using SDE are hypocrites and wouldn't be fine with similar pejoratives i.e. ""flat chest energy"".***I think the reason people are fine with SDE is because, in the case given, it was implicit shaming rather than explicit shaming.* *When most people think of body shaming, the think of an explicit insult designed to hurt a person based on a bodily characteristic they have. It is possible to be against explicit shaming and not mind implicit shaming, even if both can be seen as harmful.***People that aren't fine with using SDE just want to get rid of all insults.***I thought this myself at one point, but after diving into it with someone else, I think it's more that people that are against using SDE, and insults like it, want to get rid of the implicit shaming.**Looking through comments, I've found that most against using SDE would say that words like ""pussy"" do not count as sexist even though there can be an implied connection to women. I think this ties back into the societal understanding of the fact that the connection does not exist.**This can be seen in another pair of words ""stupid"" and the R-word. Even though the roots of both words are similar, explicitly degrading mentally disabled people, society has decided that ""stupid"" no longer implicitly degrades them, while the R-word does.* # ConclusionI think that there can be a case made for avoiding implicit harm from body shaming through using terms like ""Small dick energy"". However I think it should be recognized that when we are talking about this type of body shaming, it is not in the same league as explicitly making fun of a person with a small dick.I think this case is similar to the talks Destiny has had about the use of the word ""rape"". Even though Forcibly assaulting someone in a dark ally, and pressuring a tired spouse into having sex can both be seen as ""rape"", there is a huge difference in urgency and actions between the two when addressing them. And one can be staunchly against one, without necessarily seeing the other as a pressing issue.",6070,1038,-0.9979,0.122,0.815,0.063

8169,Destiny,"Question to the Eurocucks. Why don't you like Hockey? Preface: This past world cup, specifically the England-USA was the first time I ever watched a Soccer game at the professional level. I can see why you guys like the game, I enjoy the passing and the struggle to move the ball, and trying to get into position to score. However watching that game it just seemed like a very inferior version of hockey. In hockey the game is about passing and getting in position to score. However hockey is superior in every way. It is simultaneously faster and more physical. Imagine taking all the skill and fitness to handle the soccer ball, then do it on ice (faster and less friction) while the ball is 1/5 the size and not ball shaped. And while handling the ball some one on the opposing team can check you into a wall. The Question i have is if you eurocucks like soccer so much why dont you like Hockey. And don't give me answers about weather and sweden/Czechia and such. I live in Maryland and it is at a latitude of Spain, sicily, Greece and turkey, and my town is a hockey rink and the Pens and Caps are popular.So why don't you like hockey its exactly the same as soccer just faster and more physical and more skill and talent demanding.",1237,229,-0.611,0.084,0.867,0.05

The international poverty line (IPL) is set to around $2, and is calculated as the average of national poverty lines of 15 very poor countries. This absolute IPL threshold, one could argue, does not take into account that as countries get richer, their living standards increase, as does the value of their basic needs.The World Bank published an article that seems to address this problem by constructing a relative measure of the poverty line, which they call the societal poverty line (SPL). The SPL takes into account the median level of consumption per person of each country, making poverty relative to each countries‚Äô consumption standards.Looking at the graph from the article, one can see that although the societal poverty rate is higher than the current international poverty rate, it still declined over the last couple of decades significantly. Unless there is some criticism that I‚Äôm unaware of, I think this article is a good way to refute the claim mentioned in the title, and support the claim that economic development in the last decades has lead to a global decrease in poverty.",1464,241,-0.9885,0.186,0.758,0.056

8183,Destiny,"3 Weird things I found in the Twitter files. So I am with Destiny when he says that the Twitter files have been largely a nothing burger. I have videos where I talk about how crazy the right is for cooming over this. I have read every single twitter file as of last week and only found a few weird things.The first, in twitter file 6, they talk about how the FBI was reporting tweets for review. I think that is kind of weird. The only thing that would make this not weird is if they only wanted to know if the tweets were foreign or were reporting illegal stuff. I dont like the idea of a government entity using their connections with social media to report tweets even if they do break TOS. But that is what it appeared they were doing. I know twitter files were set up to write a narrative so if there is any information that counters this narrative I would love to know what it is.The second thing is it appears the FBI rumored, during meetings with the board of safety from twitter, that there would be stuff coming out about Hunter Biden before the NYP article came out. That is odd and there are three possibilities I can think of as to why and how this would happen. But those three possibilities either has the FBI being incredibly lucky and unlucky at the same time, them being horribly corrupt, or them being incompetent.1. Its possible that they were guessing that something would come out about hunter biden, truly thought the source was going to be foreign actors, and was talking about it with twitter and other social media sites. Burisma was hacked earlier that year so something like that could have made them guess that something on hunter was going to come out, got lucky that it did, and unlucky that it seemed to have come from a legitimate American source instead of foreign actors like they said, making them prime meat for conspiracy theorists. 2. Its possible they are just incredibly incompetent. They had the laptop for almost a year before it leaked. Now I could be wrong, but to me that seems like enough time to verify the legitimacy of the laptop. Again, I could be wrong. So in this scenario they hadnt verified the content yet, and they knew that Rudy Juliani had gotten a copy (according to the twitter file they were watching him and even made the  claim that he was the target of a russian disinformation campaign). Having not verified the legitimacy of the laptop and knowing that Rudy would most likely leak his copy this could be grounds to rumor that something was about to come out about Hunter. Though, if they had verified the content already then they would have known it was a legitimate leak and that they should not be involved in getting it taken down. I guess its possible they verified the content of the laptop but didnt know what Rudy had, and thinking that he was the target of a Russian disinformation campaign, they thought it was possible he had russian materials. But it didnt appear that Rudy was a target, at least I didnt see any reasoning behind that belief, soo them making decisions base off that could have been incompetence too. I would be interested in knowing why they were talking about the possibility of a Russian Leak involving Hunter Biden and why they thought Rudy Juliani was a target. 3. The last option is the Right wing conspiracy. They knew everything was legit, they knew it was going to leak, and they wanted to stop it from gaining any traction to help Joe Biden.The third thing that was weird to me plays into the second. Twitter apparently did simulations of a Hunter Biden leak before it happened. It doesnt look like the FBI was involved in that, but why? It does prove that they were worried about the possibility before the NYP article came out. Anyway that is my two cents on it. Any perspectives from DGG that might be interesting? Would love for Destiny to look into this and know what he thinks. Fucking finish Factoria already!!! If someone is able to get on to aske him that would be cool. I dont watch live nor am I a subscriber so the odds of me getting on is low.I can post links later if need be.",4095,749,-0.9873,0.109,0.833,0.058

I put myself in his shoes and tried to think how I'd feel in that situation and I'm not really sure.

My family doesn't celebrate christmas (Jewish) but i still understand the significance of the fact he was officially uninvited. The moment he said that is when i finally realized Destiny lost the fight for sneako's soul. Many people were saying it happened long ago and that may be true but this for me was the moment I could see it.I just hate to see families break up over shit like this and hope Sneako gets a second chance to connect with them if he ever realises where he is wrong.,1243,230,-0.8541,0.137,0.755,0.108

8218,Destiny,"I feel that Destiny doesn't really understand the cost of college. Maybe I'm really out of touch or my experience is out of the norm, but I'd say 20k in loans a year is roughly the cost you'd expect to go to an in-state state school. This is including room and board and all the minor additional fees they charge. Also that living on campus and paying for room and board is often REQUIRED until you have 30-60 credit hours (1-2 years). Even after that you still have to have enough money to pay rent for housing near the school and pay for food, unless your fortunate enough to live with family and commute to school every day I suppose. If that option isn't available, near school housing isn't typically much cheaper than living in a dorm (maybe even more), but it does have the advantage of having more space available than a walk-in closest. As for food, unless you plan on surviving on rice and beans (and spending hours a week prepping), or live off dollar menu fast food if it's nearby and destroy your health, the cheapest meal plan is going to be roughly the same cost as getting groceries, and more convenient in terms of time investment throughout the week. Additionally, whether you are paying for the school's room and board or staying off-campus and buying your own food, the cost to do so is well beyond what is reasonable to be able to afford through work alone making $10-11 an hour (what most retail places around me pay, and what I'd make working a job at the school.) If you are able to sacrifice 20 hours a week working and go to school full time, maybe you could bring the debt down to 15k a year. Still, that 20 hours has to come from somewhere, sleep, gym, studying, socializing, relaxation so you don't have a breakdown from stress. Also some additional bullshit, to my understanding all loans except the federal subsidized loans start collecting interest as soon as they are payed out. So unless you are fortunate enough to be in a situation to have parent pay towards it or have an extra couple hundred a month to pay down the loan (interest rates % are even higher if all you do is pay down interest or just leave it), add a couple thousand more to your debt at the end.I'm pretty cynical about the cost of college, if there's anything I'm missing please correct me, or share your experience with paying for school. I still think it's generally a good investment in yourself, unless you're like me and are unable to finish but still left with a lot of debt. P.S. I know grants and scholarships can help if you're lucky enough to get them, but they are inconsistent and I wouldn't plan around them.",2625,480,0.9675,0.081,0.808,0.111

So I will pose a case that looks like a negligent or unintentional action and try to make a case for why it would still count as a genocide. Questatement because I don't have any background in philosophy, so I may pose some questions but this is my overall statement.Let's say some lawmakers decide to classify all forms of gender affirming care as self harm and all the associated measures are applied to trans people, i.e. being trans in itself will be treated the same way as suicidality. Since, the identity of being trans is not acknowledged by these lawmakers as being real, the intent behind the law is as it seems: helping mentally ill people by taking away means of harming themselves and the ideal outcome would be ""curing"" this illness. From their perspective there is no intent to destroy the transgender identity, because it doesn't exist. But if you acknowledge the transgender identity, this law would be a genocidal act in terms of its outcome but can a third party transform the intent of the lawmakers because they are operating in a different reference frame? I don't think that intent behind any action is malleable like that and so saying that technically its not genocide because the intent is missing doesn't change the fact that the result is.",1438,248,-0.8637,0.103,0.822,0.075

8234,Destiny,"Risk of teenagers or actual children being targeted on discord servers Hi..Discord is very interesting, it allows young and old to connect, people of different races, ages, religion, etc.Quite cool and new and interesting.It also offers a platform where thus adults can speak to teenagers or potentially younger people.This is impossible to filter as it's really easy to lie about your age, or because you want to be welcoming towards all ages.However, aside from the political load around issue. About 1 in 20 men is said to be a pedophile.. This number is probably higher when you take into account attraction to teenagers.I think we must seriously think about the potential of potential misconduct by men with bad intentions (not to be sexist, but yes, virtually all these incidents don't come from women, I think perhaps 1% in the literature).These man exist, it's not too uncommon, and discord gives them a huge reach.. They may even try to artificially inflate their sense of trust/reputation with multiple accounts.I think streamers should be really careful with this, and pay attention to the risk, especially those with a younger fanbases.",1148,187,0.6165,0.074,0.822,0.104

8237,Destiny,"Destiny appreciation (dick sucking) post to encourage good behavior in the community Several months to a year ago, I forgot how long ago specifically, a new point of discussion had begun to make its rounds in the trans discourse. You saw a smidge of it on stream earlier today (28th Dec). The hormone wash/trans-woman period/hormone induced menstrual cycle *thing*  suddenly appeared again and our lord and savior Destiny brought us the light: Its bullshit. Honestly I'm afraid its a troll. I thought my fellow TRT enjoyers would recognize that its bullshit but I guess being on TRT doesn't preclude stupidity.For reference: 28 Dec stream: exampleAnyone with half a brain-cell and a smidgen of knowledge on TRT knew this was complete and utter horseshit. It was semi-popular in the panel discourse around trans athletics and the creation of an (OMEGALUL) endocringe category. For anyone who missed it, here are some examples of this white dude (apparently?) named Synth who fancies himself an endocrine expert. Afterwards a few epic contemporaries of D's managed to lock onto this talking point, namely Vaush, and while I haven't heard this for a while, it seems to have gradually involved and entrenched itself in the trans community in some very odd forms as we saw above.42 minutes in has a few examples: VideoAnyway, 2 or 3 years of hormones will not make you perfectly the other sex, I'm sorry to those deluded if you are reading, but people are talking out of their asses. Unfortunately your prostate will not start shedding blood  mucus like a uterus. However this is not the point of the post. Some DGGers (I think probably one of the gym tag losers) and I who are more familiar with the topic noticed this when it started and sent him a few emails on the topic of TRT, its limits, effects, and about the hormone wash stuff. I know he read them because he said so on stream, and probably researched a bit more, because soon after he was more proficient in talking down this specific misinformation. I don't exactly have a clip to prove this but im fairly certain Destiny went from his default, ""Idk man maybe that's true maybe not"" shtick to refuting it in a later panel. I've also seen Destiny become more proficient in talking about other topics as well thanks to the knowledge in the community. History in general being one of these topics. I think its easy to see this development considering how absolute shit his history was at one point. ~~I wanted to write this in hopes that Destiny would notice me~~So I wanted to write this post to show those new community members or anyone generally unaware that your emails, reddit posts, and other comments, if they aren't dogshit, eventually make it to Destiny in one form or another, so don't be afraid to share.Also this isnt an invite to email him about stupid shit like podcast ideas.

8243,Destiny,"[effortpost?] Body shaming men is one of the few things uniting the left and right wingers Before I start I urge everyone to go to r/smalldickproblems and see for themselves the real world harm and suffering this type of language causes vulnerable people. Earlier today, There was a post in which Greta responded to Andrew Tate's childish tweet by saying he has ""small dick energy"", and while I don't like Tate at all, her comment has caused harm to more than Tate if he was harmed by it at all.Body shaming is bad because it includes a much wider range of people than regular insults do and is usually based on unchangeable traits. And what I usually get is that ""small dick energy has nothing to do with small dicks but specifically the energy of an insecure overcompensating person"" to which I ask why is small dick energy the symbol for an insecure overcompensating person and not big dick energy? It is because the view that small dicks being bad and big ones being good is near universal in society from all political corners including the ones that are usually against insults based on bodies let alone unchangeable ones. Imagine someone saying black skin energy or gay/trans energy to describe people they hate.Just a few days ago this subreddit was filled with people asking destiny to be nicer when talking to possible rape victims because his language causes real world harm and today a post body shaming men is the most upvoted post of the day and no other post is even close to it.It is no coincidence that r/bigdickproblems talks about how to find underwear that fits right and stuff like that while all of r/smalldickproblems recent posts are about how much Greta's comment has harmed them especially because of how viral it became with little to no pushback from leftist, and if you stay for a while you might find one of multiple suicidal thoughts posts that aren't uncommon there.One of the most commonly given advice to men who feel ashamed of their penis sizes is to not really care because nobody cares about penis sizes but considering how this whole thing happened and how much leftist defend bigoted insults towards them when when the few people who called body shaming out do, just reassures them that is not all in their heads and that the view is still rampant everywhere.It is always sad to see what leftist think of bald, short and small dick men when one of those things are held by men they hate, just look at how much fun was made of Ben Shapiro's height, Jordan Peterson's voice, Elon Musk's torso memes, Tim Pool's baldness, the guy from r/ toiletpaperusa who's face is made fun of for being small and much more.Lastly, even if you still don't somehow believe that small dick energy has nothing to do with penises size, you should at least acknowledge that it causes real people unnecessary harm and suffering based on unchangeable traits about them. It is not difficult to be nice. If it wasn't so common to shame small dicks everywhere I bet there would be much more men with small penises opening up about their feelings about the topic but are now bottling it up or moving away from the left and into those who *seem* like they care about them like Tate and Peterson.",3205,568,-0.9982,0.2,0.731,0.069

Learning each other's bodies and preferences, building up trust over time, and having experience and skill with the act. These factors all affect the maximum amount of pressure that can be derived from the partners involved. **The average red-piller's POV:**I have to do most of the work anyway, so her skill/technique is a negligible factor. The hornier I am - the better the sex is. My horniness is linearly correlated to how hot she is. Also novelty is a hotness multiplier because ""ain't no pussy like new pussy""! That's why ""strange"" is a term to begin with.I think when you're younger and don't have a lot of experience, the latter POV makes sense. But once you've seen enough poon, the novelty is not as alluring as it once was. You eventually are less awestruck with cookie cutter hotness. Then Destiny's POV creeps in, and it becomes a matter of min/maxing to derive ultimate pleasure.What do you think?",1077,182,0.7492,0.017,0.919,0.064

What I hate that they both defend socialists that wrongly use their money and use their money for ways that directly go against socialism (example Hasan‚Äôs mansion , luxury cars). The only argument they have is that they live under capitalism so they must live or operate under it, but that doesn‚Äôt make it right for Hasan to my a huge house and just brush it off as ‚Äúliving under the system‚Äù. While being a fan of Hasan I can‚Äôt help but notice the over simplicity in his arguments and lack of evidence for his beliefs, it seems he only follows what he wants to and just hides under the leftist aesthetic . As for Vaush, i don‚Äôt understand why he supports spending like that or in his words ‚Äúgood land lords ‚Äú. Destiny is correct when he says Hasan is a hypocrite and has far better arguments to support it then either of them. I feel like a a socialist you should live your life with what you need with some wants, and use the rest to help your community, and while there is a grey area of what is moral to use money on, it definitely should not be for luxury items.

There is, today, an extremely important election happening: this is, of course, the election for ‚ÄúDGGer of the Year‚Äù. I have been nominated as an ‚ÄúHonorary DGGer‚Äù, and I want to make the case to all you fine folks as to why I think I am an obvious choice for DGGer of the year.Before we get into the individual reasons, an important reason right off the bat is the fact that I was labeled an ‚Äúhonorary DGGer‚Äù. For too long have us r/Destiny redditors been treated as second class citizens, some sort of pygmy off shoot of the ‚Äúreal DGG‚Äù. This is bullshit: we are the real DGG, just as much as the chat if not more so. We create the memes for the Twitter. We‚Äôre the ones who conquered r/place. We‚Äôre the schizoposters who create content.Now, getting into the individual, I think I have been a content machine as a DGGer. I have been responsible not only for effort posts, but for high entertainment drama. I have provided content not only for Destiny, but also for some of the most top tier orbiters. But, lets stop with the generalities, and lets get into the actual things I‚Äôve been involved with over the past year, in chronological order:1. We had me leading some of the original pushback against everyone‚Äôs favorite Nazi queen, Mrs. Lauren Southern.2. We had the original post calling out the ‚ÄúSo you just want him to be nicer??‚Äù defense for Destiny‚Äôs Twitter, although it was unfortunately removed by auto mod filters for having the r-word in the title. However, you can read the original post in its entirety through this recent repost, as the issue came up again.3. We had the ‚ÄúThe Official Demon Mama Guide To Answering A Question‚Äù, which went on to be the direct inspiration for the most viewed video on Rose Wrist‚Äôs channel.4. We had the ‚ÄúFuck Vaush‚Äù minifesto, an absolutely glorious deranged hate schizopost that ended up being reviewed both on stream and turned into a Destiny video.5. Then of course, there‚Äôs the Nick Fuentes dog whistling post,, earlier pushback on Nick and exactly why and how he continues to use his style of dog whistles, with pretty locked in evidence.6. I assisted with the Destiny Vaush manifesto, a glorious success for our great leader.7. We had the second debate guide, this time about Mr. Girl, being one of the lynch pins in initiating the subreddit war that would produce one of the biggest dramas of all of 2022.8. Just two days later, your boy came back hard with a nice ‚ÄúGotcha‚Äù memepost, showing there‚Äôs more than just schizoposts to him.9. We then have the final, biggest effortpost of this year, a response to the entire ‚ÄúIs Nick a Nazi‚Äù debacle and the questions that came up surrounding it. Although looking back it was perhaps a bit too long and lengthy, I would feel odd leaving it out.10. Countless comments, responses, and generally being a very active member in this community and subreddit, as it‚Äôs a community I genuinely think is quite solid and really enjoy being a part of (DGG for lyfe).So, if you‚Äôve read all this through, I think the choice to vote for me should be obvious. I will end with a link to the straw poll, and I encourage all of us r/Destiny redditors to show our power and our strength as true DGGers.Link to the poll!",3333,588,0.9968,0.039,0.815,0.145

The answer is dependent on who you are as a person and what your strengths/weaknesses are. There are pros and cons to any career and if you have to add them up yourself. But it isn't unreasonable to make 100k a year doing trade work.   I have a lot of experience at both ends of the spectrum. I have a couple of degrees and am about to finish an Electrical engineering degree  I can tell you if you join the local union you can eventually make 6 figures. Become a master plumber, or become an inside wireman. UPS drivers make 80k a year. You have to put in the work, but the same goes for college. You will have to earn it, but if you have an IQ of 90 you can do it.   If you're 18 and unsure about college, I'd consider the reserves in the military and/or get a part-time job at FedEx, UPS, Amazon, etc. You'll at least be able to get some tuition reimbursement and also get the feel for what factory work is like.

Congratulations, even a third world country like Argentina has better healthcare.There is this idea that Canadians are open minded people, but if you have a talk with your avenger Canadian you will realize that the only reason why we think they are open minded is because they do not have the spine to protest for what they really believe. And those who have a spine, pursue a career in American media (Lauren, Crowder, etc.) Trump supporters are retarded but are 1000% more genuine than any Canadian.I hate them, at least with Americans you know what kind of people you are getting, Canadians are just snakes by nature.

Destiny explained it makes him sound like he agrees with Ye's crazier thoughts as well, but I think it's also just an easy statement for Sneako to make. If Sneako wants to spread the ""love everyone"" message, why as a non-Jew would he use Nazis as an example? ""I love my girlfriend, and the man I got nauseous from watching fuck her"" is a stronger message for him to make, but he'd rather be ""misinterpreted"" as an anti-semite than ""misinterpreted"" as a cuck. It's just wild to me that these people take a holier than thou stance while going down the easiest road possible.

8342,Destiny,"Destiny was incorrect about Europe not being redrawn after ww2. Even though sneako‚Äôs argument was silly in this context, what Destiny said was factually incorrect. Briefly listed below are some major territorial changes that occurred only in Europe. These geographic changes were  accompanied by an enormous ethnographic change that fundamentally shaped Europe as we know it today.Poland:Pre-War: Poland controlled parts of western Ukraine including Lviv, as well as parts of western Belarus. For reference, Minsk was on the Polish-Soviet border. Most of modern day Poland west of Gda≈Ñsk was annexed from Germany after the war. Poland expelled the German population from these areas after annexing them, and renamed the towns and cities to Polish names.East Prussia:What is modern day Kaliningrad, was a German exclave in Poland and was substantially larger. East Prussia was bordered in the west by the city of Gda≈Ñsk and the Vistula river, and bordered in the south around the area of Olzytn.  Areas of southern Lithuania used to be part of East Prussia as well. Germany was portioned into two parts, East and West. Under occupation of (soon to be) NATO and the USSR respectively. Western Germany was portioned in to various occupation zones controlled by the UK, the US, and France. Finland lost territory in the winter war against the USSR. Finland‚Äôs border used to extend southward to Saint Petersburg.Albania took over part of Greece.Italy lost territory that it held in Modern Day Croatia. Moldova was separated from Romania. This only covers changes in Europe, and does not mention changes imposed by the Nazis that were reversed by the allies after the war (I.E Hungary). There were also immense territorial changes in Asia/Pacific areas. I would encourage destiny to read up on WW2 history in the future, and look at how geography and history intersect so he is better prepared for these conversations.",1912,308,-0.7017,0.063,0.879,0.058
8343,Destiny,"Is my job immoral? I got a new job a few months ago. My essential function is to design/re-design fracking sites and bring them within concordance of modern environmental protection legislature. Obviously, fracking has negative impacts on the environment, thereby effecting the natural habitat of animals who live in the region, as well as potentially polluting the drinking water of nearby residents. The other day I even heard an NPR radio show about how a town in my state has not had clean drinking water for months.However, fracking also provides jobs and essential power. We do not currently have the infrastructure to go fully green pretty much anywhere in the nation (that I know of). At least in the immediate future, we need fracking. I do fear, however, that I am doing measurable harm to the world in the meantime. The goal, in my eyes, would be to get away from fracking entirely within 50 years.Am I destroying the planet until then? Should I feel bad? Should I just ignore my feelings?It really bothers me that I work in an industry I think ultimately shouldn't exist.",1083,186,-0.9649,0.143,0.816,0.041
8344,Destiny,"It it is so funny when Sneako says ""Jesus would have loved the Nazis"" with the most straight face I've ever seen. He hasn't read any of Bible if he truly believes this.

You are 100 percent correct. He would've crushed their beliefs and sent them on a different path type of love. Oh yeah, he would've vehemently argued against them as well. Sneako, you should see what happens to a renowned prosecutor of Christians. Someone who was actively hunting Christians. Learn how to read outside of your children Chruch scriptures and look at the bulk of it. Look at the story of the Apostle Paul who was formerly known as Saul.I say even read Exodus. These scriptures even give you a picture of what enslaving and murdering his people will bring upon you.

Kanye was cancelled for going defcon 3 on jews [a phrase that implies defensive measures btw look it up, not actually hateful to say i want to stop being assaulted by protecting myself] all the other incidents Destiny mentioned happened as a response to that initial tweet. He didnt get dropped from addidas until Drink champs, but he had already lost tons of partners already and was restricted access to his bank account already.2.) Kanye never denied that the holocaust never happened. He just does not believe in binary good an evil. Life is not a disney movie. Putin is neither good nor evil. Pre woke disney even has a quote about this ""Only siths deal in absolutes""3.) Ben shapiro does [correctly] indeed believe that jews are not a race. Isrealites are a race, jews are not. You can not be racist to jews. That's why the ADL came up with their own word.4.) History is clearly definitely written by the victors.

I brought it up to my therapist who TOOK MY MOMS SIDE? That makes no sense, there's never a wrong time to speak TRUTH. I suspected my therapist did not have her moral axioms grounded, so I proceeded to ask her position on incest. Just as I thought, she said it was wrong. I clarified that it would strictly be about same-sex twins who were separated at birth (so there's no reproduction or power dynamic issues). She continued to insist it was disgusting but gave NO morally persuasive reason. Anyway, I feel like I did nothing wrong confronting my mom.

What Elon is responding to is the ability to increase the velocity of features. To which, Elon replies that a re-write is necessary alluding to Technical Debt. In legacy systems, and by all measures the Twitter infrastructure is a legacy system, technical debt impedes the ability to implement new features, due to the legacy design assumptions. Also, some of the original requirements may no longer apply, and further constrain the ability to implement new features, as they need to be integrated in the legacy system. Elon is simply thinking as an engineer and is stating the fact that a full re-write would allow him to engineer a solution that meet the current demands and needs of today, unconstrained by a legacy system's implementation - where some portion of the code base is still engineered for the requirements of 2006. I speak from experience in the industry, I am a System Engineer for a defence company working on mission critical systems, we can discuss further in the comments.tl,dr; Destiny does not understand the comment from Elon about the re-write due to the technical debt, but he is right about his business acumen- but what do I know I am not a billionaire.",1369,230,-0.2617,0.055,0.889,0.055

Listen up dumbfucks, let me spin you a tale of moderation and edgyness.Mysogyny, racism, ableism are all hillarious, there is no way around this, but they can hurt as well. We have tried to moderate ourselves while still keeping the funny stuff. Content wide bans have been instituted, with little to no distinction to the nature of the joke. I suggest we change that, collectively. This way, we can keep people happy and call then morons as well.To this, I offer a few unspoken rules you all (hopefuly) follow in real life and suggest we apply them here. For the purposes of this, think of online shitposting as boxing.1. boxing ring rule - know your surroundings. Some locations are appropriate to punch someone, others are not. Keep your edginess contained to locations which are built for it. If the content creator is wholesome/profesional - keep their energy in their comment sections. If they are not, lock and load your gamer words.2. self defense rule - Allow the person who initiated the conversation to set the tone as to what is appropriate. If say, someone starts a reddit post with ""Listen up you dumbfucks,"" they are giving you the implicit go-ahead to shit on them as much as you want. If the other person has not made any such insult, do not introduce it.3. tap out rule - Always allow the other person to disengage, if they do EVERYTHING STOPS. If they ask (even implicitly) you to stop this conversation, wish them happy holidays and shut your fucking mouth. That being said, any new comment from them offers you the chance to reengage.bonus: broken arm rule - if the other person is clearly losing their shit, do not pile on them. They probably cannot consent to a boxing match and they cannot consent to internet bloodsports.Obviously I cannot enshrine these as law, they are open to interpretation and some (3. specifically) would need help from Tiny or mod team to really institute. But, some of us have bullets and we can make small changes ourselves.I wish you much happiness and gravy in the new year and if you think I am wrong, I wish that maybe next year you grow some braincells that you sorely need.",2199,389,0.8848,0.111,0.752,0.136

8536,Destiny,"Saying that 1984 is mainly about language (newspeak) is dumb as fuck and makes it hard to believe that you've read the book. Whenever Destiny brings up that people who associate 1984 with government surveillance haven't read or have understood the book it really annoys me. Yes newspeak is an interesting and important concept, it is however not the main focus of the book. You wouldn't spend all of this time setting up  telesceens, the useless wars, the rewriting of old news articles to be fully in line with your current agenda, doublethink, the brainwashing in the ministry of love, the resistance movement, that is probably fake and the caste system if you only wanted to describe how changing/ limiting language can influence thoughts. The only time Orwell even goes indepth on newspeak is very early on in the book where Syme (a character that gets disappeared by the thought police shortly after) explains it. After this discussion in the first fifth of the book, newspeak is barely even mentioned anymore. Especially in the section where it is O'Brien torturing Winston in the ministry of love you would expect it to be brought up more, if it is so integral, but the focus there is mostly on doublethink and how the party sustains itself.If newspeak is the only thing you took to be important from 1984, there is a good chance you read an essay about it, but not the book itself. You might also just love to be smug about picking out one aspect of a piece of media, that might be overlooked by a lot of people and blowing it up to make everyone who didn't notice it look stupid compared to you.",1604,285,0.8476,0.08,0.823,0.097

8542,Destiny,"‚ÄúWomen are funny. Men will kill you.‚Äù Thank you, Destiny, for pointing this out. The fact is sometimes as a woman, if it‚Äôs a situation where you keep telling them no, and they get angry (like break stuff or punch walls to intimidate you), sometimes you do freeze in that situation. Especially when you‚Äôre young and stupid, you don‚Äôt always realize that they will act like that when they get pushy. I do sympathize with women like that especially if they are naive and young. I agree that it‚Äôs stupid behavior but you have to look at why it happens. Knowing what I know now, I would simply NEVER put myself in a situation where I would feel physically uncomfortable. I would *never* go to a guy‚Äôs apartment like that. But in a lot of cultures and places, these kind of ‚Äútalks‚Äù about relationships and safety are just so taboo.  It‚Äôs just not a thing. A lot of relationships are secret and under the radar in a lot of places. And if he‚Äôs someone who is also from your culture, you think he understand and will be considerate. So when you first have a relationship? You blindly trust that person and think it‚Äôs safe to go to their apartment‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt think or realize they will be pushy for sex. Yes, I really just thought it was a great chance for me to cook something nice while we watched a movie or played games or whatever. Yes, I know now that was so stupid and naive of me. So what do you do when that happens and you don‚Äôt want to get physical? Or in my case, if you‚Äôve both talked before and he agreed/knows that you are waiting for marriage but he still gets pushy? I said no and basically left. He broke a bunch of stuff and threw things and I got scared and I left. Later he did apologize, but after that, I never felt comfortable going back to his apartment. I realize now that I was very lucky, my dumb young self really believed and trusted that he wouldn‚Äôt hurt me, but who really knows? If it was someone else, things could have been unimaginably worse. But it was the first time that I was actually scared of him. Even though I was able to get up and leave, many other girls might not feel safe enough to do that.

I don‚Äôt really understand the hype about AI art in the long run in terms of its ability to replace humans.",875,157,0.989,0.04,0.737,0.223

8568,Destiny,"Why Public Survivor Disclosures are Bad, Actually [Effortpost] I think most people don't know that there is a profession in Advocacy for survivors of domestic and sexual violence. I have eleven years of experience in this sector. The goals of Advocacy are to provide clients with unbiased advice and support with legal protections that allow them almost complete confidentiality with a client much like and sometimes exceeding a therapist. They can help with anything related to the effects of SA. They are never meant to make choices for clients, but rather provide them with the range of options and possible outcomes and allow them to choose for themselves. They help make decisions like:\- If/when to report to police. The risks/advantages involved and the lengthy process ahead  if they choose to report. Communicate with law enforcement/county attorneys office on behalf of the client.\- Peer and professional support groups, counseling, traditional/spiritual healing resources\- If it's advantageous for them to get a restraining order against their assailant or if it would pose more risk\- If they need prolonged leave from college, work, etc\- medical decisions related to STDs, long-term health, pregnancy, evidence collection\- Services to increase anonymity like name changes, legal address changes and accompaniment to all court proceedingsAnd these are just some of the many. Sexual Violence can affect someone's mental health, living situation, and life's plans in a myriad of ways.When presenting all the options and services available the one thing I never bring up as part of the plan was the option of **publicly disclosing your trauma on social media.** Advocates absolutely encounter survivors who wish to make that choice, and with survivors who already have and are **dealing with the fallout**.# The #MeToo MomentWhen #metoo happened in 2017 and led to the eventual downfall of Harvey Weinstein survivors saw a lot of hope in that situation. For the first time they were able to reach across industry silence and an abusive system of cover-ups to create enough public outcry that led to justice either legally (Weinstein) or by society's rejection of them (Kevin Spacey). It was also a large scale opportunity for people to share with each other that they also were a survivor when most people lived with that in secret. It was humanizing to see how many around you were affected and how truly not-alone you were.The outcry of support and feeling of community is what people remember most about this era, when those speaking were so many it wasn't as daunting to bring your trauma out in the open. Dissenters were shot down and survivors were able to share in a really empowering moment online. Though survivors should feel welcome to share their experiences on their own terms and there should be ample opportunity to do so, the reality is that the #metoo hashtag was still a movement based in social media. Like all hashtags, the shelf life of it was short and sweet. Now that we are outside the #metoo moment, the landscape for public disclosures has returned to being rocky as usual.Skepticism of the justice system is high and with good reason. With it being revealed that many states have a backlog of sexual assault kits they've not even tested and the unlikelihood of assaults going to trial let alone providing consequences for assailants it can feel like your options are limited.So why do I bring up #Metoo? Because when people encourage or consider public disclosures, I think this is what lives in their mind: a wave of unquestioning support from likeminded people where before you felt very alone.# Why Public Disclosures Are Bad, Actually1. **They discourage lower level conflict resolution**Humans are naturally conflict avoidant. It can be tempting to resolve negative feelings or memories that are sexual in nature by seeking public validation, rather than face the social consequences and ickiness of removing that person from your life or speaking to them one-on-one. Without these discussions, it leaves much up to interpretation and can lead to misfiring on the wrong person when a conversation would have sufficed. What's worse is if you bring a public allegation that the public deems not worthy of such a reaction, any future claims you make will be discredited. Leaving someone even more vulnerable to sexual violence and being disbelieved is not a good outcome in any case. I wonder if in the wake of Arianna's situation with OTK, if the current one could have been resolved behind the scenes without anyone's credibility being questioned. **2. The crush of questions after the wave of support**When people look back on #metoo they remember endless tweets of support to survivors, but not the endless questioning that followed. #Metoo is an unfair representation of what its like to bring claims forward when yours is the only one. Suddenly your trauma becomes an avatar for situations others have encountered, and you find yourself in a position to either take harsh criticism or defend yourself by providing more invasive detail. Destiny is correct in saying that it isn't the internet's responsibility to coddle you. All the yasskweens and validation in the world doesn't take away the sting of the doubts and criticisms, and people revealing such personal information aren't in a headspace to take constructive criticism about their victimization.You also can't prevent the weirdo actions people will take when they think they are ""supporting"" you. I've seen survivors who have had their cases discussed publicly in the media who have then had picketers outside places they were assaulted or use their story for social media campaigns to show ""support"" when really it's just triggering to have to see that every day. **3. It leaves survivors open to legal action**Depending on what a survivor says or how they say it, perpetrators can take legal action against their accusers that can be life-changing even if it's not criminal in nature. I've seen more than a handful of such disclosures end in the survivor getting a restraining order granted against THEM because their disclosing and support of that disclosure on social media is deemed harassment. These judgments again leave a survivor more vulnerable to being disbelieved in the future as anyone sees the restraining order and assumes they were in the wrong. Restraining orders can also force a survivor to have to change jobs, schools, travel patterns and dwellings.**4. It can have negative consequences for further criminal action**It is also human nature for people to seek community when they are going through something difficult. It's common for survivors to want to communicate with victims of the same perpetrator and commiserate over their experiences in a way others could not. Unfortunately, such things can be viewed as collusion between victims and can be used to discredit them. Even advocates occasionally have had their records subpoenaed if they serve more than one survivor of the same perpetrator, in an effort to accuse the agency of encouraging collusion.# What have I told survivors seeking advice about publicly disclosing their trauma?What I asked anyone disclosing, whether publicly or privately, was ""what is your purpose in disclosing? Is it because it will make **you** feel freer having it out in the open? Are you doing it because you will feel healed by it?Or are you doing it because you think it will protect other people (with no guarantee it will and at much personal risk)?Are you doing it because you're hoping the reaction you get will be healing (even people who love us can deal with information like this very negatively)?""If someone was putting themselves out there because they thought the response was going to validate them, I always provided my clients with the reality that the negativity will always drown out the support in their minds, no matter how small. That no one is owed their story, and that even formal police reports don't guarantee you are saving any future victims from harm. There is a reason SA Advocacy agencies have worked so hard to provide and maintain confidentiality: Anonymity is fucking based, actually.If anyone is considering disclosing trauma on any level, I encourage them to reach out to RAINN which is the National Sexual Assault Hotline. They can provide immediate support and connect you to an Advocacy organization in your area that is more familiar with how the system works near you. Advocates will never tell you what to do, they will provide you with options and a real-life view of possible outcomes so you can make informed decisions about how best to handle your situation.Bonus Meme:Tier V Supremacy DGGL",8705,1421,-0.8602,0.125,0.745,0.13
8569,Destiny,"It's not that complicated, Destiny just hates circlejerks I can empathize with Destiny a million percent on this one, even if I don't really agree with his position.So here's the problem with what he said.  The energy coming off of him feels more like ""fuck that girl for getting raped"" rather than ""fuck that rapist for raping her"", and that's why everyone's upset about it.  And it makes sense to be, because that sounds like his priorities are fucked up.But to him, everyone knows rape is bad.  It's not interesting to just talk about how rape is bad.  There are a million other people saying ""fuck that guy for raping her"".  Him just echoing that position would add nothing to the conversation. But meanwhile, there's pretty much nobody pointing out ""actually her behavior here was bad too and we should be pointing it out (and maybe even shaming her for it) so people don't keep doing that behavior"". So he points that out. But then suddenly the ""rape is obviously bad"" circlejerk detects someone going against the grain and instantly turns against him, thinking he's running defense for a rapist.  So then he goes on the defensive and gets increasingly more aggressive the more people fight him on that point, because he knows he's right about it.Nothing about this is surprising if you've watched Destiny for any significant period of time. I'm not necessarily saying it's good or okay, but once you understand that he just dislikes circlejerks, then you don't need to resort to these nonsense ""Destiny is just intentionally trying to get people to hate him"" or ""Destiny just thinks being nice is soy"" arguments.If the rest of the world was saying ""fuck that girl for being so stupid"", he'd be defending her and directing more of his aggression on the guy, 100%.",1769,305,-0.9964,0.238,0.69,0.072

8582,Destiny,"What Destiny hates most about DGG, Destiny Destiny has stated several times on stream that the aspect that he hates most about his community is that we can't just disagree with someone instead we become hyper-aggressive and insult/hate them. After the discussions over the past while regarding his tweets, it seems to me that that aspect of the community's behavior is an emulation Destiny's aggressive tone when he engages with people on other platforms.While I think Destiny himself can just disagree with a person and that his tone in twitter is him being mean for his own fun, he clearly doesn't think that is always the case for chat, and I agree. Chat can adopt superficial behaviours from Destiny for better or worse, regardless of whether they share the same underlying feelings Destiny does. Destiny recognizes this much given his anti-misogyny arc. Destiny had fun making women-related jokes because he knows he isn't misogynistic, however chat begins to latch on to the behaviour, and for some chatters it isn't a joke anymore. Destiny recognized this and adjusted his behaviour and the community to try and reduce that. Chat is a reflection of Destiny's behaviour, though not intent. We characterize parts of Destiny behavior that are hyper aggressive to the point of comedic (Nebraska Steve, twitter Destiny etc...), but then some adopt this ""Gigachad"" persona as a way to act normally. We then instead of disagreeing with the opinions or behavior of someone and calling their actions ill-advised, we call them ""retarded (sorry Lex) fucks who are a cancer to society"".Is it a matter of being nicer? Yes. Is he obligated to be nicer? No. But if Destiny wants to reduce the aspect of his community that he himself hates the most, it begins with his behaviour.",1770,296,-0.7975,0.106,0.786,0.108

8589,Destiny,"Why Destiny is Wrong About Elon Musk Destiny's recent comments about Elon Musk are very subjective and he seems to have lost his calm and reasoned approach to evaluating the situation. Here are a few points I think that Destiny is wrong about Elon Musk1. Elon Musk has improved the health of Twitter by reducing a significant portion of its expenses. Now, considering he's only been there a few weeks, cutting down so much overhead without the companies falling apart. Meaning, he must have had a lot of experience in running a tech company to know where its ok to cut from and where it isn't. 2. Destiny is forgetting that when you lose advertisers, other advertisers replace them. If Twitter has a lot of eyeballs on it, especially now when it is arguably very popular, then someone would pay to advertise on it. Destiny is talking about Twitter losing advertisers as if it's a permanent thing. Even if the loss of advertisers causes the price of placing an ad to go down, someone will still pick that offer up. 3. Destiny thinks that ""technical debt"" is a buzzword. It most certainly is not. Mature companies that have been around a while, accrue technical debt and that makes it harder and harder to release new features needed to increase revenue as well as make the system more fragile and difficult to maintain. Elon Musk did not outright say that he wants to redo the whole stack in order to fix it, but some rewrite in some specific module or microservice might well be needed. A rearchitecting of some parts of the system, may well be needed for Twitter to them develop at a much faster pace. 4. Mentioning Tesla's stock going down is not an objective claim to make against Elon Musk. Prior to the lockdowns, the FED printed 41% of the dollars in circulation. Those found their way into assets and onto the stock markets and inflated valuations. That is why you say stock prices on the S 500 go up 35% while half the country was in lock downs where you would have expected them to go down. This is why you would see progressives say that all the richest people in the world doubled their ""income"" (when it is actually the valuations of stock they hold) during the lockdowns while everyone else was suffering at home without money. Now, with the FED tightening easing, those valuations are being corrected. Most stocks are down, especially tech-stocks. Now, you can make the claim that Elon Musk's behaviour on Twitter is making Tesla stock go down a little bit extra than normal, but you will have to also except that the actual company is performing quite well on delivery as well as research. 5. Lastly, Elon Musk has so far owned 9 companies. Most of them have done well and a fair number of them are in tech as Twitter is. You can make the claim that social networks are a different animal and I would not argue with that point, but to say that he has no clue what he is doing, shows a bias and lack of understanding from those who made that claim. Elon Musk understands developers, he understands the technologies, he understands where the tech should be or should be aiming to be and he has a very good understanding of the financials. I would say that he needs a better and clearer policy for moderation on Twitter and that would ease a lot of the 'people issues' and on that side, he could be doing better. But there are not many people on this planet that take over a $44billion company and hit the ground running. My $0.02",3442,623,0.9788,0.054,0.855,0.091
8590,Destiny,"I disagree with destiny's take on transitioning minors Destiny has often said no one should have a say in what happens with their child besides the parent, the child, and the doctor. Essentially, he is comfortable saddling a child with the (potential) consequences of a decision that will have lasting effects on that child's life.if you would be comfortable allowing a 13 year old to make irreversible changes to their body, why don't we also force them to decide their career paths that young? It's not a 1-1 comparison, because I'm sure many people have changed their career path. Then again, it's much easier to change your major than it is to have breasts surgically removed because of hormone therapy at a young age.If you are going to take the position that a child can make a decision about the gender they want to present as, surely you would support that child being able to get tattoos that are, potentially, for life. If there were a career path program that is potentially permanent, surely you would support a child making that decision as well. A child can be aware enough of their gender you would support medical intervention, but picking a job is too much?The reason we never hold children to the first career in their heads is because they aren't at a stage in their lives where they can speak on who they are yet, or what they are/want. Otherwise, there would be a TON of presidents, astronauts, pop stars, youtubers, and professional sports athletes looking for work. Gender and careers are not the same thing, but in a child's mind they might as well be.(im aware of the endless soundcloud artists and youtubers trying to make it. people like sneako who have been doing it since childhood and that aspiration that never went away.

I might even make the argument that the discourse slightly aligns with Destiny's point.

8597,Destiny,"Response to ‚Äúwomen shouldn‚Äôt have to treat every man as a rapist‚Äù I have no idea why Destiny is so interested in calling this rape victim stupid but I will go to bat for him here:She has said that she had no idea that her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù Rich was capable of rape, and that people (Destiny and OTK simps) calling her stupid are expecting her to suspect all men of rape. The problem is that in this situation Rich DID rape. Destiny is not suggesting that all women suspect the 18 year old Eagle Scout Mormon kid of being a rapist just because he‚Äôs a man. But just as we can look at a person who refused the covid vaccine during the Delta surge and ended up in the ICU, we can look at times when bad outcomes occurred and analyze whether or not the victim could have seen this coming or prevented it. Rich is a fuck boi who was only interested in the victim for sex. Rich heard her give clear signals that she‚Äôs not interested in sex and still started jerking off without her consent. In a different reply, she mentions this is not the first time he‚Äôs jerked off in front of her without her consent. These are obvious red flags and we should live in a society where most women are concerned about the threat of rape in the above situation, not because Rich is a man, but because the pattern of behavior, the situation and the dynamic is highly troubling. The fact that she was raped is tragic and unacceptable but it should not have come out of left field to someone who is clear headed about the situation. I think many people will implicitly connect calling a victim stupid to believing the rapist is not fully culpable or the victim in some way ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù to be assaulted. I don‚Äôt believe that Destiny believes those things. People can be stupid and still not deserve the bad things that happen to them. But we can still call them stupid in order to help others avoid the bad outcome. In fact that is one of the benefits of the me too movement, not just exposing predators but also showing the situations that women find themselves in before they are raped so women can avoid them in the future. Nobody who refused a vaccine deserved to die of COVID, be we can still call that dumb if they were old, had comorbidities and we know that in the end they DID die of Covid. Azalia did not deserve to be raped. But she was vulnerable, she was in a bad situation, she was with a rapist and while she could not have known she definitely would have been raped, she could have suspected that was a possible outcome of the decisions she made that night and what she already knew about Rich. She could have been smarter and decreased the amount of rape victims in the world.",2655,499,-0.9994,0.314,0.581,0.105

It feels lacking any sort of empathy, humanization, or charitability  for a person he (again) agrees was probably *raped*.

8610,Destiny,"The entertainment value Destiny provides is worth more than the possible political or social influence it has. Recently, there have been several arguments related to rhetorical effectiveness in the mainstream. Sejin is of the opinion that Destiny should sanitize what he says in order to better ""fulfill his goals if reaching more mainstream audiences."" Arguments against this have generally been a long the vein of ""Destiny's edginess is a large part of what makes him who he is/ appealing to his current audience.""My position is that fundamentally live streaming is about entertainment and the enjoyment it gives to viewers. It's often overlooked but viewers having fun has value and is the most predictable and consistent product of the stream. The political influence yielded, is negligible in comparison to the entertainment provided. If people being happy/ enjoying things has moral value (which I would contend it does) and rhetorical changes significantly alter that while only mildly increasing how well packaged his message is (unprovably so kind you)  it's a bad thing. Political influence is significantly less than entertainment in terms of product. While political influence is valuable, the change needs to be large to overcome a moral barrier of stream enjoyment.

I‚Äôm reposting it now because I‚Äôm seeing a bunch of the same shit arguments used to defend Destiny here, especially the ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs technically right, but you want him to be nicer!‚Äù. It might be lazy to just do the repost, but considering it‚Äôs the exact same arguments, figured I‚Äôd give it the same response. I've seen this again and again, and this argument annoys the fuck out of me. It seems like as long as you can find some much more modified, toned down agreeable statement that seems similar enough to the initial take, we can say whatever offensive, caustic statement we want. The problem is how we say this, the emphasis on what we say, and a willingness to actually communicate it in a productive way are as important, if not more important, than the actual take itself.To highlight this, I am going to give you a little example. Indulge in a thought experiment for a second with me: I'm a left of center streamer, with a career similar to Destiny's:- I've argued against the far left and the far right, and I'm known to be a little edgy at times. One day, I'm really feeling myself, and so I decide to tweet out:&gt;Stupid fucking n\*\*\*\*\*\* need to stop shooting each other, stop glorifying drug addicted deadbeat dads, go to school and get a job(only without the asterisks)(***EDIT***: To be clear, because I've seen a lot of people getting confused on this. I am not saying this tweet is a 1:1 to Destiny's tweet, or that I think this is the level of inflammatory shit he engaged in. My point with discussing this tweet is to show that even the basic ""Oh so you just want him to be nicer?"" argument can be used to dismiss any criticism of even a tweet like that. This is also not to say you can never disagree with an optics argument or think it's a frivolous criticism, but I made this post because I was very tired of seeing this used repeatedly as a cudgel to dismiss all criticism related to presentation, tone, context, etc)People get very upset on Twitter, immediately enraged. For some reason, even though I know they agree with my actual take, they're all blowing up because I didn't say it nicely enough. So I send out another tweet explaining the tweet above:&gt;What is so controversial? I'm saying that if we want to reduce racial inequality, we need to dismantle racist structures that produce environmental factors that naturally lead to crime disparities and the average black child not having the same educational opportunities as the average white child. In addition, I think it's important to make sure that black children not only have an environment they can succeed in, but positive role models that push them to succeedAfter this, I start having people on my stream, and whenever they say the tweet was fucked up, I go through this dialogue chain:Me: So you disagree with my take that there are racist elements of society that produce bad environments for black people?Them: No, I just-Me: Oh, so do you disagree with me that it is helpful for a child to have a positive male role model who emphasizes the importance of education and gives them a good home life so they don't go towards destructive behaviors?Them: No, I just uh-Me: Oh, so you don't disagree with my take at all. You just want me to *be nicer about it.***If they bring up that it's not just nicer, that maybe the language is so offensive that it could be seen as actually harmful:**Me: Wait, so is there like a black adult who's gonna get super traumatized by seeing a tweet with the word n\*\*\*\*? Look, maybe there is, I don't know: but I'll tell you what, if you're so sensitive that one tweet with the n-word is going to like traumatize you, don't go online. People are gonna be mean on Twitter, if you can't handle that then like I don't know, get yourself a caretaker and stick to watching Blues Clues or some shit.**If people say that my tweet is racist:**Me: Okay, so putting aside that I've literally argued against race realists, I would say that someone like you is actually creating a more racist world. What you're saying is I can't even bring up the issues that we need to fix, and it's people like you that prevent the discourse from actually progressing. It's important that we not only do need to recognize that there are factors, but there are good and bad behaviors people can engage in, including black people. They have agency too, we're not gonna anywhere treating them like they don't.**If people say I'm not acknowledging the negative factors here:**Me: Of course I am! What, do you think I think racism is good? Do I need to preface every tweet with ""RACISM BAD""?!  It's so fucking boring that you can't just say something without putting a million fucking disclaimers before it.**Conclusion:**If Destiny posted that initial tweet, I'd want to be able to criticize it. I'd want to be able to go ""What the fuck dude? This is a horrible, completely unproductive tweet!"" But as I showed above, even a tweet like that can have an explanation given after that is technically a take I don't disagree with, and all of the issues I'd have with a tweet like that could just be (as I've shown) shoved under the general rug of the dumbfuck ""You just want him to be nicer"" argument.So, to all the idiots out there that continue to give that shit argument, keep giving it if you want, but just understand that the bullet you have to bite is basically saying that there's almost nothing you could ever criticize him for, including the tweet above. And every progressive tweet that you allow to be defended with that ""You just want him to be nicer, but the take is good"" dumb shit argument, the more and more we erode the value of actually communicating in an effective way.And putting aside anything moral about giving a message that generates splash damage to basically any woman who's ever been in a situation where they felt unable to speak up, or putting a random rape victim's tweet at the center of a public controversy, this does have real damage to Destiny's brand and his ability to grow his platform and message effectively. Every one of these extremely poorly communicated tweets is not only a barrier in terms of just seeming to send out a toxic message (and one that others will gleefully play into), but it also raises the question of ""If this dude doesn't even know it's a bad idea to make this take, why the fuck would I ever listen to him on anything of substance?""Destiny's a smart dude. Smart enough to know the issue with these things, and smart enough to know the ""So you agree with the take but I could have been nicer"" argument is an awful one. I'm not gonna treat you guys like retarded children by continuing to accept it without pushback, and I don't want you to treat him like a retarded child by enabling him through continuing to parrot it all through the sub.I like this community too much to hold you guys to that low of a standard.",7061,1266,-0.9921,0.164,0.682,0.154

8631,Destiny,"Destiny, Genocide, and Nuance (effort post) Hey Merry Christmas everyone, today were going to be talking about genocide.Destiny and Pixies recent conversation really got me thinking and I wanted to talk about what both of them and Vaush seem to miss when talking about the so called ""trans genocide."" To be explicitly clear I want to have a discussion about commonalities between our current situation and real genocide that has happened in the past. The binary conversation of whether or not a genocide is happening right now in the US is not interesting, but we can address some of the things LGBTQ+ find worrying in recent years and how this compares with other situations. Firstly I will be using the UN definition of genocide:&gt;*In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:*  &gt;  &gt;*Killing members of the group;*  &gt;  &gt;*Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;*  &gt;  &gt;*Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;*  &gt;  &gt;*Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;*  &gt;  &gt;*Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.*Note that it is still debated whether or not sex or gender identity should be included in the definition. (in which it probably should)\*Destiny explicitly said in his recent conversation with pixie that intent should be factored in when deciding if something should be labeled a genocide or not. My understanding of Destiny's position regarding why the treatment of trans people in the US is not genocidal is:'Trans people are not being killed in mass, neither are children being removed from the group and taken to another group. Whether or not we regress in trans rights isn't indicative or genocidal intent of the majority of the population and we would likely continue to progress in trans rights even if we backslide.'He also said that labeling it a genocide by Vaush and the likes has to do with drawing attention to the issue. My issue with this position and the nuance that can be found between the two is that actions that the majority group takes against a minority group can be labeled as genocidal but that doesnt mean that a genocide is taking place yet. To further elaborate, a genocide usually doesnt happen out of no where, the decisions and social conditions leading up to a genocide involve stretching what is socially acceptable to eventually encompass genocidal actions. For example, a simple law in Weimar Germany such as 'Jews not being allowed to own dogs' are very much apart of the genocidal process because the process of genocide involves pushing normal people-that would otherwise not be okay with genocide-to eventually become okay with smaller and smaller actions that all contribute to a genocide and eventually become a genocide.Don't believe me? Well Three Arrows makes a great video elaborating on this subject. Ill summarize a bit of it here. The court psychologist at the Nurnberg Prison Douglas Kelly, argued that the leading Nazi officials (such as Hermann Goring, and Adolf Eichmann) did not all have a common psychopathic personality trait. In fact it was quite the opposite. He found that these people were actually pretty normal (granted you could argue the reliability of the Rorschach inkblot test).&gt;*From our findings we must not only conclude that such persons are neither sick nor unusual, but also that we could find them today in every other country on earth. -Douglas Kelly*You can read more about Douglas Kelly and Molly Harrower here.This of course isn't definitive but it elaborates more on something more important. Most of the Nazi leadership and SS were sane. We could even go as far to argue that genocides like the holocaust can happen anywhere and it doesnt take a bunch of insane people to orchestrate one. Racist propaganda itself isnt framed as something you should take pleasure in, but something that is necessary. This leads us to now, where conservatives in the US probably dont hate LGBTQ+ people (although there are a lot that do) but when it is framed that such individuals are ""grooming our children"" we could see a potentially bad situation where people aren't taking away the rights of other people for fun but because they believe it is necessary. This is an element of the process of pushing what is acceptable to say we saw in the 30s and 40s, which did lead to an eventual pushing of what is acceptable to do. However people like Vaush who go out of their way to fearmonger when we have made massive progressive gains for LGBTQ rights in recent years aren't doing trans people any good either. They are absolutely making it worse. There is not a genocide going on right now in the US, but we can see similar parallels of events leading up to atrocities in the past. History doesnt repeat itself but it does rhyme. So just be cautious, when people say there is a genocide going on. They are out of touch with reality, but also be cautious of the recent legislation proposals by conservatives, and rhetoric about ""child grooming"" in which we can see there could be a bad situation brewing. All of that being said considering the Conservatives seem to have underperformed in the recent midterms it can also be said that this rhetoric isn't effective. That could for sure be argued. To be extra clear I dont necessarily disagree with Destiny, but I think we can have a more nuanced opinion and more interesting conversations about this. Next Destiny also argued in that recent debate with pixie that if there is a current genocide of a group of people its absolutely justifiable for most actions against the genocidal group. Ethically speaking, I do not have an issue with this (even though you could argue it would lead to a worse outcome). My issue comes in when you continue to extrapolate from this perfectly fine take to a pragmatic situation where a certain minority group might have the option to defend itself from an oppressor group. Here Destiny argues that in that situation it would be justifiable for Jewish people to defend themselves from Nazis. Although ethically it is justifiable, we cannot continue down the line of argumentation that conservatives would go down saying ""well the Jews could have stopped the holocaust if they had been armed and willing to fight."" Its highly unlikely Jews could revolt successfully against a regime in which most of the population was okay with, and that entire armies were losing too. It wasnt even until the end of the war when the French resistance actually started to make issues for the Nazis. Not to mention in 1938 a Polish Jew named Herschel Grynszpan had shot a diplomat which sparked one of the most vicious crackdowns and mass hate crimes on the Jewish population (Kristallnacht or the night of broken glass). Knowing this Pixie's argument becomes a lot stronger; that violence against an oppressor group could lead to worse circumstances for minority groups. However there is a nuanced position we can take here. The Jews had every right to defend themselves against the Nazis, but it was unrealistic to say they could have stopped the genocide (which again i want emphasize isnt Destiny's argument, its an extrapolation people like Ben Carson want to sell you for political gain). We could even go as far to say that in a lot of circumstances the Nazis were looking for reasons to commit hate crimes and push increasingly genocidal actions. This Rhetoric people like vaush even hint at is very dangerous in our current political climate. Overall I dont think in this discussion Destiny is wrong but we can have an interesting conversation about it all and have a more nuanced opinion.",7853,1323,-0.9847,0.104,0.811,0.084

8641,Destiny,"I am confused about Destiny's position Not an effort post, I have 10 mins before I start work.From my understanding, Destiny's main defence of his recent tweets is that he refuses to contribute to the validation culture that exists in progressive spheres, and that it's important for him to have a voice calling out the mistakes made from victims to help people make better decisions in the future.First point that confuses me is that in order to help people make better decisions in the future, wouldn't your messaging need to be palatable to the average person, who would really need to hear it? I feel like (could be wrong) the average female Destiny fan would more likely to be assertive of boundaries than the average person, and that the people who need Destinies advice the most are younger and more meek women. I dont see any normie, let alone progressive ever taking Destiny's critiques to heart due to how inflammatory his responses to real life situations are. (His long form content about these issues that don't relate to real life issues is usually excellent though, I'm thinking talks with Erudite or I think he had a great one with Tree a few years ago too, but they have less eyes on them from outside his community)The second issue I see is that it seems like Destiny intentionally positions himself as the villain every time these situations arise. The greater narrative surrounding destiny is that he always phrases things in the most inflammatory light, even if he is correct on the technicalities, and then refuses any criticism by using those technicalities as a shield. This has been repeated a lot by Vaush and Hasan, but I've also seen other larger, less political figures parrot this. This gives the progressive spheres someone to rally behind and against, and I feel like almost everyone who needs to hear Destinys message would get swept into the opposite camp. I don't even believe this has to be a polarised 'Destiny vs Progressives' moment, but when Destiny attacks victims he creates that divide where you almost have to pick one side and fight the other. It seems like to me, if Destiny cared about helping women make better decisions through his messaging, his inflammatory attacks do not assist in those goals, but rather embolden people to attack him and push away the people who need to hear his message the most. (Again not a lot of time to write this, but I am trying to be less inflammatory when disagreeing with people on the Subreddit, which I think we should all try to do)",2517,438,0.5339,0.08,0.822,0.098

8680,Destiny,"Destiny doesn't entirely understand pleading the 5th While watching the Hasan v. Fresh and Fit debate Destiny multiple times put forward an argument to the effect of ""If everyone could plead the 5th at any time it would destroy every court case."" This doesn't really follow or make sense in a court case. Most of the time, each side calls witnesses who want to testify for the side who called them. This means that the lawyer is using this witness to bolster their claims, and those claims are ones that the witness agrees with. If there is something in there that could incriminate them, then the lawyer would likely not ask about those things as they would talk before calling the witness. If a lawyer calls an adverse witness, someone who does not agree with their claims, they can ask to treat the witness as hostile and be allowed to ask leading questions. The 5th is usually invoked when the witness is being crossed by the other side. So they are being adversely crossed, and their credibility is being impinged. However, if you are a witness who is not a criminal defendant in the case, you cannot invoke the 5th on cross-examination if you have already testified on direct about this matter. Additionally, if a witness has immunity they can be compelled by the court to testify if they attempt to invoke the 5th.In a criminal trial, if all of the witnesses of the prosecution just plead the 5th on the stand in both direct and cross-examination it would mean the prosecution would essentially have no case and be dismissed after the prosecution rested. It would also be incredibly bizarre. If all of the witnesses of the defense plead the 5th on the stand in both direct and cross-examination then the defense would have to simply hope the prosecution didn't carry their burden.The argument also doesn't really incorporate how questioning in court would happen. In criminal court, the state has the burden of proof, so let's imagine they call witnesses and these witnesses all make testimony that support the claims of the state. Let's say one of the cops testifying planted evidence to secure the arrest. The defense suspects this but doesn't have proof that this happened. On cross-examination, the defense attorney asks, ""You planted evidence at the scene, correct?"" As the cop has not previously testified about whether or not he planted the evidence. The officer has a few options, he could admit it and tank the case, he could plead the 5th which we can all say doesn't affect the jury's deliberation but would at the very least discredit this cop, or he can just lie and say ""no."" If he does lie, at this point the defense attorney would need to provide some proof or a line of questioning that would expose the officer's lie. Pleading the 5th from a legal perspective has a specific role, in a pragmatic perspective in regards to how to conduct a trial it is very fluid and a dangerous tool to use depending on the witness and the trial you are in.In a civil trial or a grand jury proceeding pleading the 5th can be used against you in the jury's deliberation. If all your witnesses plead the 5th, it would destroy your case and you would never call them.I think Destiny either doesn't have a good understanding of how witnesses and court cases interact, which is understandable as that is true of most people, lawyers included, or he just didn't think about it and just fired off the cuff.",3407,599,-0.9424,0.082,0.854,0.064

I did retail, shifts, physical labor, freelance and now a degree-requiring 9-5, and the things I see on that sub are almost completely foreign to me.I'd divide the posts there to three categories: one where the person posting is clearly unreasonable (expecting a literal last-minute request for day off to be respected is a popular example of this), things that I don't think are that bad (people being assigned shifts on weekends or holidays for example, or not receiving bonuses, being required to smile if you're facing costumers), and things that I just never encountered my entire life and I don't know if I've just been sheltered or what.\]That last one is what's tripping me up. I did retail and not once was I refused a bathroom break (as long as we're not in the dead heat of rush-hour), I did work-from-home and not once was I surveilled to see if I'm actually at my computer the whole time, and even if I was - I was never told that bathroom breaks would be deduced from my pay. I never encountered bosses ignoring safety protocols, getting angry if you don't respond to texts during the weekend/middle of the night (I've encountered people sending texts, not being angry if you don't reply), and many others.I know workplaces can suck sometimes, and I did encounter other things they mention there. For example, this whole business of agreeing once to do something that's outside of your job description only for people to now expect you to do it all the time with no extra pay. But generally speaking, I feel like basic conflict resolution skills would solve 60% of the issues they have with their bosses, with an additional 30% of their issues not being issues at all or being completely their fault.Have I lived a sheltered life?

8711,Destiny,"Exploring Ahrelevant's Relationship Points a Little More Just watched the new main channel video of D, Erudite, and Lycan talking about Ahrelevant's positions about relationships. I wanted to explore the body of his point a little more, since it felt like there was a pretty big blind spot in the conversation. As a disclaimer, all I've watched was about the first hour of the rele video, and the 40 minute conversation. Haven't seen anything outside of that, so it might exist, and I just haven't seen it yet.It felt like the tone of the conversation was pretty aggressive, since it seemed understood that this was a pretty incel-y flavored set of takes, but I don't really think so, at least when you consider his discussion as a whole. It seemed like, from the beginning of the rele video, and it's first segments, that the conversation began with a discussion of dealing with toxic relationships, specifically when dealing with people with trauma caused by previous toxic relationships, that cause toxic behaviors like cheating and not respecting boundaries to arise in those current relationships. Rele seems to think it's shitty that a lot of times men that are good people (not 'nice guys'), that end up settling down with women like this later in their lives, have to deal with the toxic elements of these relationships, and that they generally shouldn't have to, since they didn't contribute to it.This leads into a discussion of how these people develop trauma, and he seems to believe it comes about when they're manipulated and mistreated by their previous partners, usually men, who want something from them, usually sex. I agree with pretty much all of this, I don't think much of it is controversial. He continues to talk about the prevalence of these victims, because, for men that don't care about the effect of their actions on their partner, and are only looking for a hookup, manipulation is a pretty effective way to do it, and because of this, these men are mistreating a lot of women. This is shitty, beyond the obvious reasons, because it makes it significantly harder for them to get into healthy relationships later in life. When he talks about how there ought to be consequences to these behaviors, my understanding is that he's saying that good men ought to not put up with these toxic behaviors in committed relationships, and that by doing that, you discourage women from sleeping around with people that will mistreat them or forcing them to not perpetuate those behaviors. Now, I understand, for the most part, why a lot of this is in the blind spot. Rele doesn't do a very good job of carrying forward the former part of the discussion but spends a lot of time talking about how there's no (non-moral) reason to not manipulate women into sex. He just represents it poorly. Even the last part about the consequences is pretty poorly understood by me, I'm just filling in gaps with where I think he's going. That said though, it does really frustrate me when I see someone walk into a massive blunder that is addressed by the blind spot. D talks, like he usually does, about the importance of distinguishing hookups/FWB relationships, and genuine committed ones, and says that the more redpill-aligned takes only concern the former. This is, in the context of the discussion, false. Now that we have a blueprint for the entire conversation, we can understand that Rele actually does draw a pretty fine line between hookups, and committed relationships, saying that women that tend to engage in a lot of the former, tend to find it tougher to engage in the latter, because of the negative experiences they've carried forward, and their propensity for perpetuating cycles of abuse.All in all, I was pretty disappointed in the conversation, since it seemed like a pretty pedestrian-level engagement with the real meat of his points. Again, for all I know there's more streams that go further in depth, I'm just speaking from what I've seen. Regardless though, I would like to see how people like D and Erudite meaningfully grapple with his assertions in full.",4087,696,0.989,0.089,0.769,0.141

I genuinely can't think of any other reason he continues to make these incredibly harsh statements that will obviously get him into hot water. Be honest with yourselves, if you were to ask any person that you respect in your personal life, ""is calling a SA victim a 'fucking idiot' the week they come out with their story an appropriate way to voice an opinion on how best to avoid sexual assault?"", what do you think their answer would be?You can't make the defense that this is just something that was said in passing that he could've never known was going to get spread around. He called her a fucking idiot in the **final statement** of a thread that he sat down and collected screenshots for. He knew exactly what he was doing.You can't say that people were going to be mad anyways. Basically every top comment on both LSF threads are specifically criticizing the aggressive insults, explicitly stating that there was a way to go about saying this without coming off like a total asshole. Plenty of people that aren't Vaush/Hasan schizoposters in there as well making similar criticisms too.Calling it ""bad PR"" shows a lack of empathy. She's likely already felt like she was a fucking idiot, and asked herself similar questions, ""why did I ever go to his apartment?"" She likely considers it one of the worst mistakes of her life. If he were sitting on a stage next to her speaking to a crowd about how best to avoid sexual assault, I doubt he would have phrased it the same way.So the only defense that leaves is that he just enjoys the heat.

As far as my experience, its only from classes I took for my degree. I took a few intro classes (Intro to Visual Basic, Intro to C++) and two intermediate courses on Java object oriented programming which were required.As far as programming is concerned, I could get back into Java the easiest, C++ would not work. I was thinking of doing a self imposed boot camp of sorts (or finding free ones, or ""free"" ones), with the intended purpose of getting a job.But was wondering what are the most sought skills in programming right now based on what the hot thing is in the industry?

8749,Destiny,"Male sexuality is a curse The desire for sex and affection that men have for women is the equivalent to a ravenous¬†hunger. Since women don't experience these urges at all, there is a natural power differential between men and women due to supply and demand. There is a demand for female affection and sex, but none for men's.¬† This enables all women to possess some kind of innate power that they may use to manipulate men and validate their own worth with affection being their tool. Women are like queens and nobles looking down on men from the pinnacle of the heirarchy, while men are like starving peasants scraping up crumbs to get by. Even women who are objectively, physically NOT impressive, who lack symmetry, extremelty short or over/under weight, still holds far more power than the average man. Its INSANITY.Male sexuality is the reason why men are so insecure and are treated like peasants, while women are always put on a pedestal and are¬†treated like gods. It's¬†why all women have a sense of beauty and adoration while all¬†men have a sense of¬†ugliness¬†and loneliness. What's worse? Due to biology, there is literally¬†**nothing we can do about it**. We can't change anything. At best, we can masquerade these biological dismorphisms with lies and falsehoods through societal conditioning, but even then we'll just be lying to ourselves and we'll still be miserable.We¬†can't blame women because they only take advantage of men; they aren't THE cause of why men are this way. They don't FORCE men to simp for them; in fact, they could care less about men. Hell, most women are asexual and aromantic towards 95% of men; they just know that since men are so lonely and desperate, they can use men as they see fit even if its for something petty likely admiration and validation.If men suddenly had the sex drive of women, women would have NO power over men. There would be no more simping, no more gold digging, no more hypergamy, no more men feeling ugly, nothing. Things would finally be mututal.TL:DR: Male sex drive gives women too much power",2056,360,-0.7888,0.166,0.681,0.153

8751,Destiny,"Destiny's confidence take I think Destiny's take about saying you are confident but not around women meaning that you aren't confident at all, is fucking brain dead.To be confident around women you need more than just confidence in yourself:  \- You need confidence that the rejection won't matter, but depending on the social situation it might always have big consequences.  \- You need to be confident that the other person percieves you as valuable, but this can be entirely disconnected from the reasons why you value yourself. As an example, if you are proud of being a massive piece of shit to others, but she only likes agreeable femboys, you can go eat shit.  \- You need to have confidence that the other person understands you and doesn't react in am immature, hasty or malicious way.In other words: You need confidence in your surroundings and her, not just confidence in yourself.Bonus: I once asked a girl out on Discord and she laughed about it. I asked her why she is so rude to me and she told me that she tought I was joking and she doesn't really want a long distance relationship, but she would be happy to go on a date (which she paid for).

8760,Destiny,"Whenever Destiny brings this up, it triggers the fuck out of me Specifically this part of the video. This is a common talking point of Steven's and despite the fact that I agree with most things that he says and really respect his content and his approach to how he comes up with the conclusion of his ideas, I think he has some ignorance when it comes to the struggles some men when it comes to dating. Steve is obviously a very skilled conversationalist, who before using his talents to become a professional streamer, excelled at a customer service position and progressed faster than most in his casino job I believe. Steven comparing himself to other people in this arena is probably akin to an athlete telling other people to ""lol just run faster"". The only thing I can use to rebut this is the talk about my personal situation and the situations of a few male friends that I have or have had over the past few year. Yes is probably going to be unconvincing for a lot of you that I'm not bringing in hard evidence to support my point, but so isn't Destiny bringing hard evidence.So I'm 30 years old guy, around 280 pounds and 6 foot 3. In terms of looks I'm probably the epitome of average, or around it if I had to guess. I admit, I am overweight, but I carry it somewhat well due to my height and a lot of women I am showing romantic interest in are also fat and sometimes fatter. I have my own place, a full time job as a qualified Librarian, I keep my place clean and I'm okay with keeping my affairs in order. I have an okay amount of luck when it comes to using Tinder, usually averaging around 10 to 20 matches a week, helped by the fact that I live in a largish UK city which is somewhat small in size but pretty densely populated. I can usually, if I'm trying, secure a date once a month off of Tinder due to the fact that I have pretty good photos of myself, I have a really good about me section and my texting skills are really good and witty (I've had really positive compliments from friends about both things and once had a text from a female acquaintance complimenting my profile after she stumbled upon my Tinder profile). The issues I have when it comes to dating for me, at least this must be the issue, is on the first date. From my point of view, first dates generally go well. The conversation seems to flow, I'm good at asking them questions without making it seem like an interrogation. we talk about our interests, I'm usually able to make them laugh and the date, more times than not, end with a kiss on the lips. On 2 occasions, I've hooked up with women I've met up with on Tinder and on 1 of those occasions, it ended up being a fwb arrangement which is still going to this day.""So what's the issue?"" you're probably thinking. ""You're not the type of person that Destiny is talking about"". That's the problem, I am. Every single woman that I have ever shown romantic interest in shows none back. I don't have a mattress in the middle of my room with no other furniture at all in my flat. I wash my asshole and don't think it's gay to wash my asshole. I regularly use anti-dandruff shampoo (to prevent dandruff) and conditioner, and have haircuts when I need to. I am and have all of the things, in Destiny's world, that you need in order to have luck when dating. The so called bare-minimum. Yet, I get nothing after the first date except them saying that they didn't feel any chemistry or that ""spark"". It's a similar thing with some of my male friends too. They are absolutely fine, normal dudes who are fine to get along with. They are fine at managing their lives (I didn't ask them about the situation with their asshole I'll admit that), they are average looking, yet are also perpetually single. I don't have a concrete answer as to why some average men struggle at dating I guess. A lot of it is probably because women are generally happier single. Some of it might be because some women have had shitty or traumatic experiences dating men previously so aren't as interested in dating again. A hunch I have is that maybe it's because some men don't know how to send the right type of signals through body language and their tone of voice when showing romantic interest, like they are unknowingly sending friendly signals instead of romantic signals, but maybe that's just cope on my end. Whatever the reason is, I believe that there are plenty of men out there who, on paper, would make good romantic partners, but for whatever reason, don't make women feel that warm, fuzzy feeling. The last point I want to make, and this idea has been living rent free in my head for a while, is that you can't live in two worlds where romantic chemistry between two people is this ineffable thing where such a connection cannot be easily explained, and on the other hand chastise men by using what is essentially fencel ideology by saying that the only reason men can't find a girlfriend is because they are fucking useless. Can you define a why people are attracted to each other or can't you; pick one.TL;DR: some incel coping about why he's single probably I don't fucking know lol",5114,946,0.9992,0.044,0.776,0.18

8765,Destiny,"Watching the recent Blackpill video on Destiny's channel is so fucking cathartic. First off, welcome back to Nebraska Steve; I love when he makes a guest appearance on stream. Second, literally everything he is saying is true and it is so beyond mind-boggling how many people are trying to argue against it? I can only assume these people have to be either teenagers or just getting into college and don't have the real world experience yet to understand what Destiny is saying.The one piece of advice he consistently is putting out there is to not go to, or invite someone over to, your house/apartment if you don't want to have sex. Wanna eat? Go someplace public. Wanna have coffee? Find a starbucks. Wanna watch something? Theaters exist. You can do all of those ""date"" and ""get to know one another"" things in public. And hey, if things are going well, then you can consider an invite to someplace more private. If things are going badly, you can just leave and you also have the safety of being in public.How is this not obvious? People are fucking wild and I feel like it should be obvious that maybe inviting complete strangers into your home has more potential to go poorly than feeling someone out on a coffee date at a public cafe first. Like, a majority of the time a person getting raped is getting raped by someone they know. Here are some ""fun"" stats:&gt;How often is a stranger the perpetrator of the rape?&gt;In only 13.8% of the cases is a stranger involved in the rape. 51% of the time an intimate partner is the cause and 40.8% of the time it's an acquaintance. For the remaining 12%, the perpetrator is a family member. Most of the time, it's not a stranger jumping out from the bushes and assaulting someone. A majority of the time, rapes occur between people that know one another and usually are intimate partners. And, to the point:&gt;How many sexual assaults occur in the victim's home or the home of someone they know?&gt;A shocking 55% of the date rapes occurred in the victim's own home. As many as 12% of the rapes occurred in a relative's or acquaintance's home. So maybe keep your dates in public if you don't want to have sex. If you're not ready for sex, that's fine. If you just don't want to have sex, that's fine. So protect yourself and keep things out in public where it's significantly less likely someone is going to try to assault you. And also:&gt;What is the most common date rape drug used?&gt;Alcohol is the number one date rape drug used. Even though it's technically not a drug, any substance that impairs a person's judgement is considered a drug. Maybe having that ""date"" at a bar is not the best choice. But if you want to go imbibe some adult beverages: be safe, drink water, don't do 5 shots in a row, and have a plan to get home (uber, lyft, a drunk bus if you have those programs in town). Probably DON'T rely on your date to be your DD. Shitty as it is, this is how rapes happen. Don't go home with them and don't let them take you home either.In conclusion, the world is scary, people can and will take advantage of you, and it sucks. But there are many ways you can protect yourself and be safe to at least reduce those chances. And one of those top ways to protect yourself is to not invite people you're just getting to know into your home.",3300,602,-0.9757,0.11,0.814,0.076

8786,Destiny,"Yes, destiny is victim blaming. Does that matter? A  response to the most recent thread from destiny friend snarkily posts a  screenshot of the definition of victim blaming. Of course, this is a  cropped Wikipedia definition and the full definition from the sexual  assault center of Edmonton is much more narrow and outlines the specific  characteristics of victim blaming in context.\&gt;  It‚Äôs questioning people who experience violence ‚Äî especially sexual   violence ‚Äî about their actions, and what they could have done to prevent   it, or worse, invite it. It‚Äôs pointing out supposed weaknesses or   differences in a person that could have made them a target. In general,   it‚Äôs the common tendency for people to look for the cause of violence  as  something the person who experienced harm did or didn‚Äôt do to  prevent  it.It's important to  note the victim blaming is not an all or nothing game. You can point to  flaws in communication that may have amplified and increased the  potential for sexual assault. Of course, complete victim blaming makes  no sense, because tautologically, a perpetrator creates the victim and  is thus primarily responsible for the harm caused to the victim. But we  all know this, this isn't new or exciting information, it's boring.Different  sites will define victim blaming in different ways; however, whether  you crop the first senescent of a Wikipedia article, or you provide a  coherent definition from a reputable source there seems to be a general  idea of what victim blaming is. Victim blaming is that act of finding  fault in a victims behavior. This behavior facilitates the abuse from  the perpetrator. Understanding the actual meaning of victim blaming  leads us to conclude that victim blaming isn't a 70 year old man who  tells an abuse victim to not wear lipstick in public. There are cases  where victim blaming can be productive.In  any case, destiny is victim blaming by suggesting that Azalia could've  taken the bare minimum steps to remove herself from a situation where  sexual assault could've taken place. The thread goes over this in depth  and even points to situations where Azalia knew and signaled that she  was not interested in fucking Rich. The language, tone and content of  the thread is clearly demonstrates that destiny is engaging in victim  blaming according to all relevant definitions.The  most common argument against victim blaming is that it silences people  who would otherwise speak out about potential abuse. The argument is  sound, but it removes agency from victims to be receptive about their  possible faults and it neglects potential resources that people can use  to prevent abuse. If someone is silenced by feedback and advice, that's a  serious issue, but the source of the issue is not the blaming itself,  it's about how that blame is casted. If someone is calling you retarded  for not taking the necessary steps when you understand the potential  danger Is it possible to create  a safe avenue for people to talk openly  about the potential risks and remedies to dangerous situations.Victim  blaming could be understood in two scales. First, is victim blaming  legitimate? and second. Is the victim blaming effective? In destiny's  case, the victim blaming was completely legitimate, whether or not it  was effective was more of a toss up for several reasons. He has a reason  to be more aggressive given Azealia's age and prior behavior toward  Rich, but the if the criticism is going to be effective, it should be  generalized to a broader group of women that might be sexually assaulted  in the future. If this is the case, the rhetoric should go from an 9 to  a 6, but maybe that's too soy idk",3696,608,-0.9996,0.307,0.627,0.066

8807,Destiny,"Genuine question: When does a statement cross the line from being one about personal responsibility to keep yourself safe to one that is victim blaming? This is in reference to the Rich Campbell rape allegations and stuff. For a little context on my position, I think Azalia (the victim) isn't lying. I believe her account is accurate and that she was raped by Rich. Basically, I am a little uncomfortable by some of the things being said around these allegations. I think there is a totally fair conversation to be had about the personal responsibility for each person to protect themselves and keep themselves out of danger. But I just wanna know when does that turn into victim blaming?To illustrate what I mean, if someone had left their car out in a parking lot overnight, doors unlocked and keys in the ignition, to what extent does the responsibility fall upon them if their car is stolen? And would it be fair to place *blame* upon them? I feel like this can be applied to this as well, to what extent is the victim here *responsible* for being raped, and does that level of responsibility mean that any level of *blame* can be placed upon her?

He acted without any motive other than to diligently advance his career in the Nazi bureaucracy. Eichmann was not an amoral monster, Instead, he performed evil deeds without evil intentions, a fact connected to his ‚Äòthoughtlessness‚Äô, a disengagement from the reality of his evil acts. Eichmann ‚Äònever realised what he was doing‚Äô due to an ‚Äòinability‚Ä¶ to think from the standpoint of somebody else‚Äô. Lacking this particular cognitive ability, he ‚Äòcommit\[ted\] crimes under circumstances that made it well-nigh impossible for him to know or to feel that he \[was\] doing wrong‚Äô.the people doing the deed must be aware and know what they are doing but need to not do it from an ""evil intention"" like hate, sadistic pleasure or anger. ""I was just following orders"", a bureaucrat who just wants to advance in the ranks.so if we take it to the conversation of ""conservatives start genocyding trans ppl"" the term  can be applied to the man organizing it and killing trans people not the shoe maker or your random citizen. and it will be applied only on the conditions the person participating is not doing doing it out of actual malice but just to do he job, for monetary value etcsouce for my understanding of the conceptWhat did Hannah Arendt really mean by the banality of evil?the funny thing is that Arendt was kind of wrong about Eichmann, she missed or ignored the parts he said and was demonstrated he was fueled by hate and nazi ideology. but the definition can still exist independent of it's originating subject.

8820,Destiny,"Steelmanning the anti-AI art arguments (rant/effortpost) Been thinking a lot about AI art and hearing people's arguments about it. Decided to give the best representation of the arguments I've heard against it that I could find. For clarity's sake, I do like AI generated art.  **The main strongest argument5 against AI generated images** ‚Ä¢ Deepfake / ai generated cp / people claiming credit for other's sketches using img2img \- This seems essentially the argument of whether it's responsible to give bad actors the tools to behave maliciously. \- On the one hand it'd be negligent to give everyone easy access to bombs but on the other hand it'd be silly to take away everyone's cooking knives. I suppose the boundary then would be thought of in terms of the cost to benefit ratio of allowing people access to these tools, which I'm imagining is a more subjective and personally driven answer than a clear cut answer. \- Plus I don't even think we're fully decided on the morality of deep fakes. Personally, as long as it's not passed off as real and not used to harass or otherwise bully someone, then it seems to me no harm no foul.**Arguments against using/supporting specific AI models** These aren't really arguments against the technology itself, but rather against the ways certain models (like stable diffusion) are trained 1. People's art is being used for training without their permission \- This argument rests on what rights, morally, artists have to the usage of their work after releasing it to the public.  \- The reason we have copyright laws (morally speaking) is because sometimes creating something is difficult but copying it is easy. Thus, in order to incentivize people to create things, we provide exclusive rights to the reproduction and profit off of it to the person/people who came up with it.  \- As it relates to AI, one could make the argument that people are using other's art to make profit (by selling models or otherwise getting profit from training models off of their art), and furthermore using human's art to indirectly reduce the value of human art by creating substitutes \- On the other hand, one could also say that if the model is only trained on publicly available data (deviant art, art station, etc. ) that they don't really have much of a right to stop their work being used, especially when the data that comes out of the training process can't specifically be linked to any particular piece of art.2. Overfitting can cause it to practically copy the images it was trained on\- This is definitely possible in a few cases. Hank green had an interesting example where midjourney accidentally recreated a popular national geographic image.\- Hearing this argument makes me think of accidental plagiarism. In the same way that humans can sometimes copy concepts they've heard without realizing (e.g. comedians accidentally stealing jokes, or musical artists writing songs that can sound eerily similar to other song), the AI can seemingly do the same. I'm not sure how exactly that's practically dealt, however in theory I'd image these would be disputes far and few enough between (and even fewer between as the models get better) that they can be settled on a case by case basis. \- This also brings up another point about how different does something have to be for it to be considered copied. This question gets even blurrier now that ML models can practically create a set of images gradually getting more and more similar to an original, meaning we either have to draw the line somewhere on this spectrum, or reject the framing of the question entirely and just say you can't use AI generated work if it's recognizably similar to someone's copyrighted work.**Arguments that I don't think are very strong (from both sides)**‚Ä¢ ""It's just copy pasting images"" / ""it's looking up images on the internet"" \- This is just wrong. There are already dozens of people who have explained it better than me, but the long and short of it is that it learns what different concepts look like from the training data. Not only that, but the training process converts upwards of 40tb of training data into a 4gb model. Unless you think it's possible to compress 40tb into 4gb, it's not directly copy pasting, it's at best overfitting some images. ‚Ä¢ ""AI learns exactly like people do"" \- Only really half true. It's probably true that its learning method more closely resembles how humans learn than, say, a chess algorithm that finds the best moves by playing out all possible moves. However saying that they both learn *exactly* the same, kind of assumes you know exactly how the brain works, which is a stretch. ‚Ä¢ ""It's not real art"" / ""it doesn't have heart or soul"" / ""it doesn't take a lot of effort like you would if you actually learned how to draw""\- These aren't really arguments for why it's bad to use it, it's just a statement about personal preference. ‚Ä¢ ""The models are predisposed to the biases in the training data"" \- True, but not a reason that using AI technology is morally bad. Not even really a reason that the models are bad (morally speaking). Sure it sucks sometimes when the AI generates something you didn't want it to because of its biases, but it doesn't pertain to whether people should be allowed use it.TLDR; The strongest arguments I could find against current AI image generation are 1. bad actors using it maliciously, 2. training models on people's art without their permission, and 3. the AI accidentally recreating copyrighted or otherwise protected images.Also, I'm not an expert in any of this, so if I missed anything or if you have any feedback I'd love to hear it.",5643,969,0.9874,0.103,0.765,0.132

8826,Destiny,"A message to Aba and Destiny regarding LTG So I listened to the stream tonight and heard them say a few things that I just wanted to clear up. 1. Aba mentions LTG having a ‚Äúgood track record on YouTube‚Äù when talking about how long he‚Äôs been on the platform and you would think someone with that kind of track record would have some recourse after getting banned. Well, he DOESN‚ÄôT have a good track record on YouTube. He doesn‚Äôt have a good track record ANYWHERE for that matter. He‚Äôs gotten a LOT of strikes over the years for content violations, at one point he had two at once and was so scared of getting a third he deleted something like a third of his videos because he was so worried someone would find something in them that would get him a 3rd strike and a ban. He‚Äôs always been pushing the line of acceptable content, getting reported frequently for his racist, homophobic comments and other flagrant things like doxing and harassing people, watching explicit videos on stream (both sexually and violent), and a litany of other things. The notion that he has any kind of ‚Äúgood track record‚Äù is pretty laughable. He also isn‚Äôt that big in terms of being a content creator, it took him 10 years to get to 100K subs and was pretty widely known for using viewbots and buying subs. When he did get banned, few were surprised that it happened, the only surprise was that it took this long and that it wasn‚Äôt his content or behavior that did it, it was just a ban evasion. 2. Destiny mentions how YouTube has been his ‚Äúcareer‚Äù for 10 years and asks how can he just go back to regular work now after doing this for so long. Well, without getting personal, he‚Äôs been doing regular work the entire time he‚Äôs been on YouTube, and it‚Äôs because his channel doesn‚Äôt make that much. You can see for yourself if you look at social blade, he definitely makes money from his channel but it‚Äôs not a fortune. Probably not enough to live off, and like I mentioned he‚Äôs been working regular jobs the entirety of his ‚ÄúYouTube career‚Äù, so he wouldn‚Äôt be going back to a regular job, regular jobs are all he really knows. 3. This is like the coup de grace. At the end Destiny compared him to the character in American History X, how he put in so much work to change his life and redeem himself, and he still got screwed in the end‚Ä¶.. uhhhhh, FUCKING WHAT??????? EXCUSE ME??????? Steven, dude - you do NOT know what you‚Äôre talking about here. He didn‚Äôt do jack fucking shit towards ‚Äúredeeming himself‚Äù‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs still the same person he always was, making mean, offensive, crude, racist, homophobic, and misogynistic comments and doing tons of toxic shit on a nightly basis. The ONLY thing he has done that I can see is he‚Äôs stopped playing street fighter as much as he used to - the game that is responsible for most of his rages - and he‚Äôs put in a lot of work to not get trolled, so overall he rages less, and usually the worst of what he says and does is a result of him raging, but they still happen, and he still says and does all kinds of terrible stuff even when he isn‚Äôt raging. About a month or so ago he was harassing another content creator, doxing him on his stream and telling his fans how he would be calling the guys HR dept every day in an attempt to get the guy fired (his company and their contact info were also doxed for all viewers to see) Why? He made a video about LTG that he didn‚Äôt like. The guy that talks so much shit about others can‚Äôt handle when people talk shit back to him. He can dish it out but he can‚Äôt take it. I‚Äôm honestly just beside myself every time I hear destiny talking about LTG, because it‚Äôs abundantly clear he doesn‚Äôt know him at all, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the little he does know came from LTG‚Äôs mouth, and the problem there is he‚Äôs a compulsive liar. He lied about having the strike on his channel to his own fans (he told them he was ‚Äújust building up his other channel‚Äù) he lies about his age every time the topic comes up, and tons of other meaningless stuff that isn‚Äôt even important and doesn‚Äôt matter, which is the sign of a compulsive liar.I know that as a principle you guys are against deplatforming and all that, but I‚Äôm telling you, you do not have the right impression of this guy.  He‚Äôs not deserving of the support or praise you‚Äôre heaping on him. The only thing he did deserve was his ban. Just look at every other platform he‚Äôs been on - been banned on twitch like 10 times, Twitter 10 times. Facebook a handful of times. What‚Äôs the old saying about once is a coincidence, twice is a fluke, three times it‚Äôs a pattern? I think you get the point.",4588,862,-0.9969,0.138,0.778,0.084

8873,Destiny,"Effortpost: Why so many streamers participate in sexual assault drama This post starts with the question: why do streamers take part in sexual assault drama?Bear with me because I promise it has a more interesting explanation than ‚Äúviewership.‚Äù Making the question relevant is that over the past few years, we have seen a few prominent sexual assault cases‚ÄîFed and Yvonne, Slick and Adrianah, and, most recently, Rich Campbell and Azalia Lexi. Around all these cases, a phenomenon arose where, beyond even the assaulters/assaultees telling their stories on stream, a cottage industry of other streamers giving takes on the sexual assault became expected. Moreso, fighting amongst streamers, unrelated to the SA, epitomized SA Drama. So, again, I ask why?The answer is not the obvious one of viewership. Large streamers, the kind of streamers who ostensibly would get more eyes on them for a drama stream, don‚Äôt have significant, long-term viewership increases from SA drama. Don‚Äôt believe me, check the stats. Hassan, XQC, Trainwrecks, and Adrianah all have the same or decreased viewership before and after the SA circus they were involved in. D-Man has increased viewership, but I argue that‚Äôs because of other streaming moves he‚Äôs made and not his drama streams; at the very least, the drama streams aren‚Äôt the primary mover for his growth.The other obvious answer, enjoyment, probably isn‚Äôt the explanans either. Besides Destiny, the streamers involved in SA drama find it stressful, frequently saying they hate it.Complicating the question further is the fact that streamers have much to lose engaging in the drama. One wrong statement and it looks like you are now victim-blaming or somehow at fault. The best example of this was when Hassan had to fight in the trenches to make it clear that he didn‚Äôt commit a SA at a party he literally wasn‚Äôt at. What if Hassan couldn‚Äôt make it clear and advertisers found out? Another example is how fraught revealing Adrianah‚Äôs story became for Train and XQC. Again, this could look bad for advertisers. SA drama is not good for streamers‚Äô bottom line. The drama also doesn‚Äôt auger rising interpersonal relationships for streamers: it burns not builds bridges. Streamers know this too. Think about how common statements like, ‚ÄúI will be canceled‚Äù or ‚ÄúI hope I don‚Äôt get clipped for this‚Äù are in SA drama.So, streamers knowingly engage in SA drama which isn‚Äôt good for viewership, advertisers, friendships, or personal enjoyment. Put another way, they take part in an activity where the potential utility is outweighed by the disutility it portends. The situation I just described was first described by Jeremy Bethman, who described it as ‚Äúdeep play,‚Äù which is an activity that parties engage in where they have more to lose than to gain. In other words, it is a type of irrational activity, where both parties are ‚Äúin over their heads.‚ÄùAnthropologist Clifford Geertz used this deep play concept to explicate why cockfighting was so culturally important for Balinese people. For the Balinese, it wasn‚Äôt the money that was bet on the fights or the costs of raising and caring for a rooster that made the fights ‚Äúdeep‚Äù (though this, in some sense, made the cockfighting irrational). Rather it was the fact that the fights came to represent social status that gave them their depth‚Äîthe winner of a fight would get a couple of ‚Äúatta boy‚Äùs and move on within the community; the loser would be expected to destroy himself socially‚Äîby ransacking his home‚Äîand metaphysically‚Äîby destroying shrines and cursing the gods. So, cockfighting is ‚Äúdeep‚Äù within Balinese culture because it is irrational, socially, to cockfight when the expected social value of a fight is negative.How do we get back to twitch streamers and SA drama? I argue that twitch streamers engage in SA drama as a form of ‚Äúdeep play.‚Äù It is irrational for them to do so on a financial and personal basis. Nonetheless, they do so because partaking in SA drama represents a fight about where they stand in the social status hierarchy. It is just another type of cockfighting not involving roosters: a dick-measuring contest streamers feel the need to participate in to show where they stand in the twitch landscape.To answer the question at the top of the page, streamers thirst for SA drama, despite it being irrational for them to do so because it is a form of ‚Äúdeep play.‚Äù It lets them measure their e-peen, an irresistible act for streamers. In other words, streamers do SA drama for clout. I think the depth of play around SA drama is also why Destiny enjoys it so much. It is high stakes and stressful, anything to stimulate our Factorio goblin (along, of course, with the potential to help out the victim or person who was wrongly accused).Sorry this conclusion isn‚Äôt much more interesting than ‚Äúviewership,‚Äù but it was fun writing this post and I hope you found it interesting. I‚Äôm curious about what other, better explanations you guys have.TLDR: STREAMERS CAN‚ÄôT GET ENOUGH SEXUAL ASSAULT CONTENT BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOUTSHARKS EVEN THOUGH THE SA CLOUT IS TRASH.",5070,841,0.9637,0.117,0.742,0.14
8874,Destiny,"Do y'all know Kareem Abdul Jabbar? I was going to write a long autistic email to Destiny when I thought it would be a better reddit post because I can evolve it to schizopost status. A lot of sport athletes suck when it come to messaging or their own wild thoughts like the Kyrie Irving's, Jaylen Brown's, Aaron Rodgers'. Even guys like Michael ""republicans buy shoes too"" Jordan had his own problems in terms of being afraid to make comments. Lebron James has been arguably bad with some of his comments while good in others, but  the inconsistency is key. There is this fella **Kareem Abdul Jabbar** who is up there with Michael Jordan in terms of greatness for the sport of basketball who has lowkey been a good take machine for a lot of his life. Even if you don't really follow basketball, you probably know what a ""*slam dunk*"" is. They outlawed *Slam Dunks* in college when Kareem played, because he was so fucking dominant. The ""*most valuable player*"" award given to the ""best"" player during a season at the end of the year is named after Jordan now, but Kareem Abdul Jabbar won MORE in his career. Most points ever scored in an NBA career? That's right, your boy KAJ has that record. KAJ had the record for the most *blocks* ever, a defensive stat where you prevent a player on the other team from scoring by knocking their shot away, was held by KAJ for some time, despite *blocks* not being a recorded statistic for the first 4 years of his career. The 7 game series for the championship has its own most valuable trophy, and the only player from the LOSING team to get that was this dudebro Kareem Abdul Jabbar. That means he was so fucking awesome that he got the award, despite his team losing. Can you imagine? Of course you can, you're brilliant if you're still reading this. So, okay. Kareem is fucking great at basketball. Six time champ, six time MVP, scoring champ. Who cares? Tall dude make baskets. He was probably some kind of meathead that thinks the earth is flat and that vaccines are uncle sam filling your body with his jizz to make you mindless robots, right? Fuck no. Dude wants to destigmatize vaccines in the black community. WHAT!? Doesn't he know something bad happened before?!?! He also thinks we should destigmatize mental health issues in the black and athletic communities. Kareem has won the ""Columnist of the year"" award at National Arts  entertainment Journalism awards 7 times. 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom (from Obama, not Trump.) The NBA named its Social Justice Award after him because of his legacy.During the civil rights movement he boycotted the olympics because he was ""trying to point out to the world the futility of winning the gold medal for this country and then coming back to live under oppression."" He also studied Aikido and learned Jeet Kune Do from Bruce Lee. Starring in Bruce Lee's last movie.Kareem thought players who didn't want to get vaccinated, and any team staff who didn't should be removed from the team. Kareem said that black athletes should be spreading the message that vaccines are good because that is truly the way to help black people since they're hit hardest by covid.&gt; KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR: I think speaking up for vaccination is an extension of speaking up for Black Lives Matter because - who's suffering the most in the bad economy that is caused by COVID-19? Who suffers the most deaths in the pandemic? Black people. You can see the direct correlation between saving lives through vaccination, and we can't slack at any point and take another path (ph). There's none that works...  &gt;  &gt;Well, you know, everybody has their own choice to make. But if you want to play professional basketball with a lot of other people who would be endangered by close contact with people who aren't vaccinated, everybody's got to slow down and say, hey, we can't allow that situation to happen. That's not fair. He criticized Lebron for not using his platform to spread vaccine awareness during Covid. Lebron did some dumb Lebron stuff like sharing that spiderman pointing meme where its cold, flu, covid all pointing at each other. Kareem had this to say &gt;Abdul-Jabbar wrote on Substack that the social media post was a ""blow to his worthy legacy"" because the ""implication is that LeBron doesn't understand the difference among these three illnesses, even after all the information that's presented in the press.""Yeah, Kareem has a substack which he writes on regularly, and has tons of great takes. This should get more attention by people and the black community because of how positive and forward thinking he is. He is a really effective communicator, and I think his messages deserve more attention than they get. Kareem came out **AGAINST anti-semitic** sentiments that seemed to be espoused by Kyrie Irving. KAJ wrote on his substack: &gt;Honestly, there‚Äôs little hope that he will change because he‚Äôs insulated by fame and money and surrounded by yes-people. There is no motivation to learn how to distinguish propaganda from facts. All that‚Äôs left is for the world to decide how it should respond to him.  &gt;  &gt;**Kareem Note: The problem of antisemitism is much bigger than Irving or Ye. They are merely the unwitting spokesperson for the right-wing political movement that is blatantly taking over the GOP. (For the full story, read ‚Äú****Jewish leaders call on GOP candidates to reject antisemitic comments****‚Äù). Many Republican candidates running for some of the most powerful positions in their states and in the country‚Äîsuch as Pennsylvania‚Äôs GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano‚Äîfeel perfectly free to publicly spout antisemitic statements without fear of reprisal from their own party or the voters. That should be a very troubling sign for all marginalized groups because fascists always start by demonizing one group‚Äîright before they go after the others.**So yeah, he's been pretty great off the court as well as on. You all need to know him! Guy is on Basketball's Mount Rushmore, and should be on the mt rushmore of athletes who make public comments. Sorry for the ramble but you're all individually awesome, and worthy of schizoposts such as this. Carry on.

8887,Destiny,"Maybe if conservatives put their differences aside and respected their children's identities, they'd be spending time with their children this Christmas. Just a thought. This article is hilarious and shows the victim mentality conservatives seem to have about the world, I had to share it. &gt;Parent after parent calls my radio show, often close to tears, sometimes actually sobbing, pouring their heart out to me about being alone on holidays despite having children and grandchildren.  &gt;  &gt;In virtually every case, the parent is conservative, and the child is on the Left. I assume there are cases of grown conservative children who won‚Äôt allow a liberal/Left parent to see his or her grandchildren ‚Äî but I have never heard of a single such case. It is almost impossible to imagine a conservative adult depriving his or her parents of access to their grandchildren because the parent(s) voted for President Joe Biden. Moreover, if there were such a person, every conservative I know would vociferously condemn this individual.What is the reason for this? Maybe perhaps it's because their kids don't want to be depressed every time they see their support network, and be referred to as the right gender, or show up with their partner who isn't opposite-sex and expect their parents to be chill with that, or maybe they just want parents who aren't going to oppose their strict religious perspective onto them. NAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH&gt;Why is this happening?  &gt;  &gt;No. 1: No accountability  &gt;  &gt;No. 2:  The inadequacy of the conscience   &gt;  &gt;No. 3:  College OMEGALUL. This is obviously projection of course, the lack of accountability, lack of conscience and need to blame colleges says more than the actual words of the article do. It's not too serious a post, I just think it reflects that while the left may have a victim complex, lets not pretend it's a one-sided problem. I think a big problem in this world is the inability to put aside differences and just respect what makes others happy for the sake of a healthy relationship, it's sad that both sides of the political spectrum seem incapable of doing so.",2136,352,-0.9827,0.147,0.781,0.071

8893,Destiny,"Elon's twitter will succeed. Title is basically it, and I wanted to see discussion about it.Some thoughts I have about Elon's twitter (as a non-twitter user)- People talk about how bad it is Elon fired a ton of people, but we don't know what's going on in twitter HQ, it could be possible that everything is going to be fine and it was the right decision. - Elon's unhinged behavior probably increased engagement in twitter.- Selling the blue check might be a dumb idea but I don't think it will affect the platform negatively, it was a worth attempt at increasing the money coming it, low risk high reward move.- Elon's willingness to throw everything at the wall hoping something sticks seems like a positive attitude to me in a business that people are not really going to abandon, lets face it, people are addicted to twitter. Destiny has been banned so many fucking times and he continues going back.- Elon stepping down from the CEO position shows that he won't triple and quadruple down at the expense of the company.- Showing views on the tweets seems like a super good metric to have when it comes to getting advertiser's money. People hating on it are weird.Lets see, maybe I'll eat crow in the coming years, but I think Elon's twitter isn't going to be as bad as everybody is saying it's going to be.

8894,Destiny,"The guy who responded to Elon on advertising (and Destiny) is wrong I'm an ad buyer for 8 figure e-commerce brands and the guy responding to Elon (in this video:  is 100% not correct. Almost any ad buyer worth their salt is heavily relying on automated algorithms on Facebook, Tiktok, and Google's shopping campaigns. Automated targeting is basically the future of advertising on all these platforms, and the platforms themselves are highly motivated to improve their automated targeting, because the better targeting, the better the ads people are served, and the better the users experiences are. What Elon wants is automated targeting on Twitter that is as good as Facebook (the gold standard of automated targeting), TikTok and Google. On the other end, Micro-targeting on FB/TikTok at least will almost never be an efficient way to get sales except because CPMs will be way too high, and you're not going to out target the algorithm that can find cheaper buyers. I haven't done micro-targeting since like 2014. I'm actually an outlier in that I do do some targeting (interests / lookalikes), but the audiences of these are still above a million people at minimum. This is 100% not what ""basically all advertisers do these days"" and you can confirm this with any basic FB advertising course dating back to 2014-2016. With IOS 14, automated targeting got a bit worse, but it's still the bread and butter of any advertising campaign, and Facebook automated targeting itself has improved a ton since their data loss due to IOS 14.",1531,257,0.677,0.04,0.887,0.073

8912,Destiny,"What does DGG think about the EXISTING restrictions on aid to Ukraine? As some of you may know, I've written a fair number of posts on the topic, but now I'd like to focus *specifically* on the existing restrictions on military aid to Ukraine, and what arguments people here have in favor/against them. **The most significant of these are:** * Anything Western-made with a big gun, except for artillery. Examples include the American Abrams M1 tank, or the German Marder IFV. * Any kind of attack aircraft ‚Äî manned jets, helicopters, large drones, etc. This affects aircraft from non-Western manufacturers as well, albeit some exceptions/workarounds have been applied on this front before.* Longer-range missiles, such as the ATACMS with 300km range. I believe all of these restrictions to be illogical and potentially quite harmful in the medium and long run, and would like for them to be lifted immediately. **There is one more restriction that is significant, but of lesser importance:*** Ukraine is not allowed to use American weapons against targets on Russian territory, even for the purposes of counter-battery fire. Furthermore, I believe that where applicable, systems like the HIMARS MLRS actually have software locks to prevent Ukraine from even trying to do so. I find this restriction to also be idiotic, but it worries me to a far lesser extent ‚Äî I believe Ukraine will be capable of restoring its territorial integrity even if this one remains in place, provided the rest are lifted. If you'd like to check out my prior arguments on this topic: **There are some arguments I'd like to immediately dismiss as COPIUM:*** **Logistics**. Unless you have professional expertise on this subject, do not even bother. If the US can supply places like Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, then they certainly can supply a country that borders 4 NATO states. Furthermore, Ukraine is SUCCESSFULLY operating damn near every NATO artillery and air-defense system in existence, which are hardly less complex than the earlier mentioned restricted systems. Lastly, countless experts have already dismissed this excuse, and neither the US government nor any other NATO government even use it anymore.* **Technologies crucial to national security**. Obviously no one is asking for literal cream of the crop, brand new equipment ‚Äî the mothballed/retired stuff will do just fine.* **Muh Taxes.** Put your phone down brah. * **Fear of Russian escalation, especially NUCLEAR escalation**. If you want to invoke this argument,  I need you to write out **exactly HOW and WHY Russia would do this**. ""What if they drop nukes OMEGALUL"" is not an argument. **P.S.**: *Just wanna remind people that I'm 6'3"", 210 lbs, 8.5""*. *I have a Master's degree in International Relations and would like to debate Destiny on the topic if the opportunity ever comes up.* **TL;DR**: Give me a reason why all restrictions on CONVENTIONAL arms supplies to Ukraine should not be lifted immediately.",2962,480,-0.6247,0.11,0.776,0.114

8962,Destiny,"Went on first ‚Äúdate‚Äù, girl paid for all of it. For more context: I matched with a girl on bumble and we‚Äôve been talking about random things for, I‚Äôd say, a week or 2 now. We‚Äôve both been super busy with our work schedules but she suggested we go to a cool speakeasy type of bar that she really likes to get some drinks. From my perspective, the date was very platonic and just felt like 2 people meeting for the first time and feeling each other out. I‚Äôve always been of the mindset that I want to see if I can be friends with a person before any thought of bf/gf. However we both laughed and had some cute moments mixed in with casual conversation. So we both ordered 2 drinks each and they were around 15$ each, so roughly 60$ total for the final bill. Around last call, she whips out her wallet and is like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get this, no worries‚Äù and as I try to at least offer to pay for my drinks because I prefer to just split a bill on first dates, she‚Äôs like ‚Äúno it‚Äôs fine, you can get the next one‚Äù.

So when destiny says that art cannot be created without referencing prior artwork done by somebody else that doesn't sound true to me at all.He also claims AI learns in the same way a human does but in a scenario where art doesn't exist, have no history and we had to start from scratch, a human would be able to start creating artwork referencing real life but an AI wouldn't be able to without referencing actual artwork from what I understand, so saying that humans and AI learn in the same way doesn't sound right to me either.Idk maybe I'm missing a point here so I'd be happy to learn why I'm wrong",1075,196,0.172,0.081,0.83,0.089

I have been trying but failing to get into relationships, I don't get many matches on dating sites or apps and when I do, they are usually scammers sadly (yes i have premiums for all the sites/apps i use). So i have become pretty desperate in the past 9 years.  Recently got sent nudes from a woman i know, saying her husband will be going away for a week with a wink emoji. She is married for roughly 10 years with no kids. She wants me to come over this weekend. She is a user from an ex-client, I have a pretty good FRIENDLY relationship with her, but i never expected this. I can also say that i did have a crush on her for a little while when she was still a client (I work for an outsource IT company)So what does DGG think about this situation? I feel like I shouldn't, and i always believed i would be able to say no to a married woman quite easily, but now that i'm sitting here staring at her nudes i feel like I can't say no, i am torn to say the least.TL;DR: Got sent nudes from a married woman looking for a hookup, 9 years without sex has made me pretty desperate.View Poll",1241,245,0.9182,0.105,0.755,0.14

9019,Destiny,"The Measure of a Man This will be the longest and most soy post ever written on this subreddit.You have been warned.Something bothered me about the arguments being used against AI being artists and they all basically came back to them not being ""human"" enough. It *felt* not just like a bigoted conversation but a racist one.A lot of the AI conversations strike me as being also very similar to conversations race realists have about black people. This similarity is one that was touched on in 1991 in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation where Whoopi Goldberg's character,  Guinan, is talking to Patrick Stewart's character, Captain Jean Luc Picard.  &gt; (There is only one customer present, sitting at the bar)    GUINAN: Do you mean his argument was that good?    PICARD: Riker's presentation was devastating. He almost convinced me.    GUINAN: You've got the harder argument. By his own admission, Data is a machine.    PICARD: That's true.    GUINAN: You're worried about what's going to happen to him?    PICARD: I've had to send people on far more dangerous missions.    GUINAN: Then this should work out fine. Maddox could get lucky and create a whole army of Datas, all very valuable.    PICARD: Oh, yes. No doubt.    GUINAN: He's proved his value to you.    PICARD: In ways that I cannot even begin to calculate.    GUINAN: And now he's about to be ruled the property of Starfleet. That should increase his value.    PICARD: In what way?    GUINAN: Well, consider that in the history of many worlds there have always been disposable creatures. They do the dirty work. They do the work that no one else wants to do because it's too difficult, or to hazardous. And an army of Datas, all disposable, you don't have to think about their welfare, you don't think about how they feel. Whole generations of disposable people.    PICARD: You're talking about slavery.    GUINAN: I think that's a little harsh.    PICARD: I don't think that's a little harsh. I think that's the truth. But that's a truth we have obscured behind a comfortable, easy euphemism. Property. But that's not the issue at all, is it?  Right now it is easy and comfortable to view AI art and artists as just simply a computer program compiling all of the art it has been fed but not only is that how human artists work. That is how Humans work. We are a byproduct of everything we consume from the world around us and those we interact with. AI artists learn from each time they are given a commission from a client just as a human artist does. The artists are given a more or less vague description of what the clients want the picture to look like and the artists do their best to transform those words into an image, based on all of the art they have seen and made. What happens when AI starts to begin to scrape social media in order to find out what kinds of art or subjects for art are popular and begin to make art from those things on their own? What happens when based on how many likes those art pieces get on social media they begin to make more art like that and begin to specialize in it? Is this not exactly how a human artist would function in today's world? I want to know a real reason for why the AI would not be called an artist outside of bigoted positions that rely on ""oh, it isn't human, therefor QED.""Later in this episode Picard has to prove in front of a naval court that Data is a being that should be given all of the consideration that a human person would be in the same circumstance. I hope that this exchange might help some of you see the potential for how we should begin treating and talking about AI.&gt;**\[Courtroom\]**   &gt;  &gt;PICARD: Commander Riker has dramatically demonstrated to this court that Lieutenant Commander Data is a machine. Do we deny that? No. Because it is not relevant. We too are machines, just machines of a different type. Commander Riker has also reminded us that Lieutenant Commander Data was created by a human. Do we deny that? No. Again it is not relevant. Children are created from the building blocks of their parents' DNA. Are they property? I call Lieutenant Commander Data to the stand.    (Picard has Data's case with him. He opens it)    PICARD: What are these?    DATA: My medals.    PICARD: Why do you pack them? What logical purpose do they serve?    DATA: I do not know, sir. I suppose none. I just wanted them. Is that vanity?    PICARD: And this?    (The book)    DATA: A gift from you, sir.    PICARD: You value it?    DATA: Yes, sir.    PICARD: Why?    DATA: It is a reminder of friendship and service.    (Picard activates the hologram of Tasha)    PICARD: And this? You have no other portraits of your fellow crew members. Why this person?    DATA: I would prefer not to answer that question, sir. I gave my word.    PICARD: Under the circumstances, I don't think Tasha would mind.    DATA: She was special to me, sir. We were intimate.    (Phillipa sits up)    PICARD: Thank you, Commander. I have no further questions for this witness.    PHILLIPA: Commander Riker, do you want to cross?    RIKER: I have no questions, Your Honour.    PHILLIPA: Thank you. You may step down.   PICARD: I call to the stand Commander Bruce Maddox as a hostile witness.    COMPUTER: Verify, Maddox, Bruce, Commander. Current assignment, Associate Chair of Robotics, Daystrom Technological Institute. Major papers    PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. Suffice it to say, he's an expert. Commander, is your contention that Lieutenant Commander Data is not a sentient being and therefore not entitled to all the rights reserved for all life forms within this Federation?    MADDOX: Data is not sentient, no.    PICARD: Commander, would you enlighten us? What is required for sentience?    MADDOX: Intelligence, self awareness, consciousness.    PICARD: Prove to the court that I am sentient.    MADDOX: This is absurd! We all know you're sentient.    PICARD: So I am sentient, but Data is not?    MADDOX: That's right.    PICARD: Why? Why am I sentient?    MADDOX: Well, you are self aware.    PICARD: Ah, that's the second of your criteria. Let's deal with the first, intelligence. Is Commander Data intelligent?    MADDOX: Yes. It has the ability to learn and understand, and to cope with new situations.    PICARD: Like this hearing.    MADDOX: Yes.    PICARD: What about self awareness. What does that mean? Why am I self aware?    MADDOX: Because you are conscious of your existence and actions. You are aware of yourself and your own ego.    PICARD: Commander Data, what are you doing now?    DATA: I am taking part in a legal hearing to determine my rights and status. Am I a person or property?    PICARD: And what's at stake?    DATA: My right to choose. Perhaps my very life.    PICARD: My rights. My status. My right to choose. My life. It seems reasonably self aware to me. Commander? I'm waiting.    MADDOX: This is exceedingly difficult.    PICARD: Do you like Commander Data?    MADDOX: I don't know it well enough to like or dislike it.    PICARD: But you admire him?    MADDOX: Oh yes, it's an extraordinary piece of    PICARD: Engineering and programming. Yes, you have said that. Commander, you have devoted your life to the study of cybernetics in general?    MADDOX: Yes.    PICARD: And Commander Data in particular?    MADDOX: Yes.    PICARD: And now you propose to dismantle him.    MADDOX: So that I can learn from it and construct more.    PICARD: How many more?    MADDOX: As many as are needed. Hundreds, thousands if necessary. There is no limit.    PICARD: A single Data, and forgive me, Commander, is a curiosity. A wonder, even. But thousands of Datas. Isn't that becoming a race? And won't we be judged by how we treat that race? Now, tell me, Commander, what is Data?    MADDOX: I don't understand.    PICARD: What is he?    MADDOX: A machine!    PICARD: Is he? Are you sure?    MADDOX: Yes!    PICARD: You see, he's met two of your three criteria for sentience, so what if he meets the third. Consciousness in even the smallest degree. What is he then? I don't know. Do you? (to Riker) Do you? (to Phillipa) Do you? Well, that's the question you have to answer. Your Honour, the courtroom is a crucible. In it we burn away irrelevancies until we are left with a pure product, the truth for all time. Now, sooner or later, this man or others like him will succeed in replicating Commander Data. And the decision you reach here today will determine how we will regard this creation of our genius. It will reveal the kind of a people we are, what he is destined to be. It will reach far beyond this courtroom and this one android. It could significantly redefine the boundaries of personal liberty and freedom, expanding them for some, savagely curtailing them for others. Are you prepared to condemn him and all who come after him to servitude and slavery? Your Honour, Starfleet was founded to seek out new life. Well, there it sits. Waiting. You wanted a chance to make law. Well, here it is. Make a good one.    PHILLIPA: It sits there looking at me, and I don't know what it is. This case has dealt with metaphysics, with questions best left to saints and philosophers. I'm neither competent nor qualified to answer those. I've got to make a ruling, to try to speak to the future. Is Data a machine? Yes. Is he the property of Starfleet? No. We have all been dancing around the basic issue. Does Data have a soul? I don't know that he has. I don't know that I have. But I have got to give him the freedom to explore that question himself. It is the ruling of this court that Lieutenant Commander Data has the freedom to choose.    (Data walks over to Maddox)    DATA: I formally refuse to undergo your procedure.    MADDOX: I will cancel that transfer order.    DATA: Thank you. And, Commander, continue your work. When you are ready, I will still be here. I find some of what you propose intriguing.    (Data leaves)    MADDOX: He's remarkable.    PHILLIPA: You didn't call him it.    (Maddox leaves)    PHILLIPA: You see? Sometimes \[the legal system\] does work.",10039,1719,0.9993,0.075,0.778,0.147

Another fundamental element we would have to add is a separation between severity of the actions committed and severity of resulting trauma. This could potentially incentivize people to stop leveraging trauma as the strongest point of evidence for their case. Just take a second and imagine a world where the channel 5 girls said ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a bad guy because he harassed me (by doing whatever it was) and directly caused me mild/moderate/severe trauma, so be advised all fans and future hookups.‚ÄùIm well aware that if a person is violated they shouldn‚Äôt have a responsibility to quantify their trauma but if we can give them tools to more accurately present the situation in a way that protects them (if you blame a victim for having too high of a trauma reaction they couldn‚Äôt control, you get endlessly shit on by all of social media) then I can see a system like this being helpful. For some particularly Tate oriented people we might have to work through the concept of feeling traumatized as a result of actions taken against you but for the semi sane among us I don‚Äôt think the current system is better for taking sexual assault seriously.",1525,267,-0.994,0.24,0.652,0.108

9053,Destiny,"Titans seem to be extremely powerful in PVP For context, I am a D1 vet Warlock main who plays little to no Titan. I have a 1.0 lifetime KD, 1.7 current season KDA (I used to be trash, trying to work on it). Until recently, I wasn't able to play Destiny and coming back to PVP, it seems to be that Titans are uncontested as the best class.I'll try my best to outline why I think so, but keep in mind, I haven't played in a while and have not played PVP very much within the past year and a half.* Firstly, I consistently notice how fast Titans are. Many, many times, I am astounded when a Titan I have gotten to absolute health just shoulder charges out of the way and I can't touch them anymore. It was my understanding that Hunters were meant to be the most agile, with Titans being more tanky.* Continuing with shoulder charge, it does not seem fair to me that Titans can have a one-shot melee when warlocks have nothing of the sort. Even Hunters have throwing knives on gunslinger. Admittedly, I haven't tooled around with the arc melee for warlocks in PVP, but in fighting against it, it hasn't one-shot me yet. I don't think it is fair for this to be the case (an issue I have had since D1)* Next, the abilities. The storm grenades are obnoxious as hell and the fact that they can track to enemies is extremely surprising. Even though there are other grenades that track, they have nothing like the duration and the AOE. * The class ability also seems to be somewhat of an issue, although not as much. It may be due to my lack of skill, but I find it difficult to deal with barricades, especially with Citan's being what it is. On the base ability, it takes a great deal of damage to destroy, leaving you open to attack from any source and the damage mechanic makes it impossible to push without certain death. Citan's makes this 10x worse with you being able to be shot from the titan behind the barricade itself.* The final thought I have relates to exotics. It seems to me that Titan exotics have far more usability in PVP than Warlock exotics. Many of the latter's rely on kills, something that cannot be guaranteed in any situation in PVP. Some Warlock exotics (Boots of Assembler, Promethium Spur, Chromatic Fire, Vesper of Radius, Apotheosis Veil, Karnstein Armlets, Verity's Brow, and Felwinter's Helm) just seem straight up useless in PVP (and some also for PVE, but less so) while it seems that many Titan exotics, even if they are just as few, have much more usability. This may just be due to lack of knowledge however, so I am open to feedback.As I said, I am not as experienced as many, so these opinions may just be wrong. This post is partially fueled by anger, but the majority of it is simply me noticing a trend in Titans being consistently stronger in almost every aspect. I also think that Titans got much better subclass reworks (especially when compared solely to warlocks, I mean WTF is Dawnblade), but that is a topic for another time. Please let me know if I am wrong or not in the comments, although please do try to be civil about it. I know I am not the best player and in no position to be making suggestions on how the game should be. I just want to know if this is just me or not.",3217,601,-0.994,0.151,0.766,0.083
9054,Destiny,"[Effort post] Thoughts on redditors calling a man entitled for wanting to join girls night out? Specifically this AITA post.You can read the post and the responses, but in short, feminine dude with mainly female friends expresses feeling left out by girl‚Äôs night, Reddit calls him pouty, needy, and entitled.I am friends with someone who has gone through a similar experience. My friend is rather feminine, at times uncertain about his gender, and mainly friends with women. He has trouble connecting with men because their interests and ways of discussing things tend to be different. He has also expressed to me feeling like it‚Äôs hard to feel part of female groups, because he feels like he is relegated to being ‚Äúthe man‚Äù and not allowed to open up and be empathized with like the other women. He at times feels like his feelings and contributions are brushed off as him just being ‚Äúa man.‚Äù Now, please note, this man was not perfect, and had sexual relationships with like half the women in this group he was part of and the complicated nature of that naturally influenced their opinion of him, but knowing him and knowing the group, I definitely think his feelings of being left out were valid.I am the gender opposite of this: a woman who tends to not share interests and ways of discussing things with women, and who usually ends up with mainly male friends. I‚Äôve had my experiences of trying to join male groups and being constantly put down and excluded from activities I‚Äôm interested in just because I‚Äôm a woman. I think there is something especially painful about being told you‚Äôre not allowed to join in with the group you feel more aligns with your interests and nature simply because of your body and society‚Äôs perception of you, nothing about how you actually behave.I also think it‚Äôs rather interesting that many of the comments on that post are putting down the dude while making sure to include that trans women are totally okay at girls night, as if feminine men are not allowed to exist, they must declare themselves women in order for their interests and nature to be validated. Additionally all the people telling him he should have more guy friends and stop trying to be friends with women, it really feels like it‚Äôs enforcing this idea that all men must conform to the majority‚Äôs expression of the male gender, or be labeled a creep.I also find some of the requirements people are laying out to participate in girls‚Äô night rather strange: must have experienced side effects of birth control, must have family members prepare them for inevitable sexual assault, must have a menstrual cycle (with an edit of course to make sure everyone knows they are not transphobic and this isn‚Äôt supposed to exclude trans women). Also the person acting like all her girls nights are talking about periods and vaginal issues. Tbf, I‚Äôm not part of women friend groups lmao but I‚Äôm pretty sure when they‚Äôre together they don‚Äôt solely talk about women‚Äôs oppression and vaginal issues. And personally I would never be down with sharing TMI medical details to a large group of friends, even if they are the same gender as me lmao.I also hate the idea constantly being reinforced in the comments that a man wanting to hang out with women is obviously a creep who wants to sleep with them (and also the gender reversed idea of this where a woman who wants to hang out with men is a pick me who wants their attention). It reinforces the idea that relationships between men and women are inherently sexual and different from same gender friendships. And in general I feel like this is what the majority of comments reinforce: that friendships between men and women are inherently different than friendships between women and women, and there is a level of connectedness that the man is not allowed to breach. And this is definitely what my friend felt like was happening in the friend group he was part of. Now, tbf to the women in this scenario, it seems like they haven‚Äôt been friends for long, and so I can totally understand for safety reasons being sus of a guy wanting to join girls‚Äô night. However, I also think his approach of simply expressing how this makes him feel hurt is totally reasonable. They are all new to a city and obviously the things you do as a collective help cement people‚Äôs place in the group early on, and he is being excluded from that.Anyways, considering how progressive people like to seem, it is surprising to me that people are so unempathetic to how someone might feel when navigating friendships when they primarily get along best with the opposite gender",4590,801,0.9991,0.056,0.749,0.196

9124,Destiny,"The conversation about ""incels"" is pretty tone deaf when so much of it is geared towards the attention grabbing minority rather than the average When using ""incel"" in this post I'll simply be referring to guys that have a very hard time finding relationships / sex, personally I associate it with more the kind of guy that's very misogynistic and can't get lead, but the term gets used so much when talking about the former that I decided to use it in the broad way in this case.For context I read this post and the comments in it along with watching some of the convos Ahrelevant had about his problems and it was annoying to see a lot of the same dumb points get repeated. Though shoutout to the top comment of the post for talking about what the average incel looks like rather than the caricature people have in their head and making me want to go in more details about it.Now I'll admit that my perspective might be skewed by the friends I have and what I've seen, but I feel that if a significant chunk of the quarter of guys who aren't getting any were raging misogynists who smell, society would look pretty different, also I imagine they'd be a lot more right wing.Anyway, the average incel doesn't need to be told to shower or other basic things, he's just too introverted (as in the actual definition, not using this as a placeholder for ""shy"") and risk averse for his own good, though it's funny to see those sentiments repeated by those guys because they think they're outside of the norm.I'll say that a lot of the more ""left wing"" lesson that are internalized actively hinder guys who are less social, hence why whey go look for ways to fix themselves they shift towards a more ""right wing"" way of doing things.For example if you just ""see women as people"" (which a lot of guys just take as treating them as men, which doesn't help), you're not gonna randomly approach women just cause you're into them, you're just gonna intersect with them in term of the activities you do, which both limits how many  women you meet and those you do are just gonna be friends at most.And if you try to ""just be a good person"", which is both comically bad advice cause it puts the idea in people head that having success with women makes you a good person (god knows there's plenty of terrible guys who don't lack success) and reinforces the notion that your value as a human is dictated by women being into you (which should be unlearned, being able to attract women is almost entirely independent of you being a good person, when it comes to personality it's mostly just confidence and being fun).Trying not to make women uncomfortable / not be creepy will render you entirely sexually inoffensive because you don't want to be yet another guy that burden them that way. Meanwhile the guy that just see them as fuck meat is going to shoot his shot with any of them and not give a shit about their comfort, which will lead to some success and increase his experience.Also one of the worst way this is internalized is that guys who are too self aware about their status or have low esteem won't actively pursue women because they feel they're unworthy of them and would just degrade them, basically the equivalent a sell person not wanting to sell a product because they think/know it's shit. Of course if you view things in a more adversarial ways where you're trying to extract something from women you'll have no such issue.Saying stuff like ""just be confident"" is the equivalent of telling a depressed ""to just be happy"", if you've lived a good chunk of your life observing that women aren't into, the only way to be confident would be to be delusional. Ahrelevant had this convo with Aiko that was a good example of all sympathy with very little genuine empathy / understanding. You don't need to hate yourself to be unconfident, but being blunt about your reality will look like self hatred or like a fear of rejection to the average person.Now you can fake it of course, but hardly the easiest thing to do unless you're willing to lie. Which you probably wouldn't be willing to do in the first place if you're got a more romanticized view of relationships, being with someone who only likes a persona would be even more empty than simply being alone, as for sex someone with a more romanticized view wouldn't be willing to use the shotgun approach either.Now I'll add that this is something that should be given up on, you're better off getting some experience even if it's at the ""expense"" of women, reality is that the romanticized view of things you were sold is just something that's ruining you and you need to be a little more selfish if you want to have any hope of success.Though I'm fully aware that saying this is almost completely irrelevant to the men who have given up on themselves when it comes to dating since it's more freeing to let go in truth rather than harm yourself with empty hopes.",4912,887,0.9925,0.105,0.744,0.152

I honestly feel like after sushia explained her financial issues with sejin, he realized that her best source of income would be her onlyfans. The only issue with that though is despite Sushia having the reach to make a bunch of money, her lack of posting has caused her monthly earnings from the account to be low. So Sejin came up with the idea to use Darius' mental state (over their breakup/separation) as a way to help bring awareness to the account and drive back up subscribers. He then helped her get all the photos ready for posting and then told Sushia to repeatedly join/leave the call as a way to bait Darius into a confrontation live on stream. All they had to do after that was just wait for Darius to realize and then inevitably do the thing that Darius does best, go off.  I know this sounds a bit wild and would honestly be pretty messed up if true but heres my reasons for why this might be the case* Rage pope pointed out Sejin was more confrontational public on stream with Darius than in their private call which would imply that it was performative and meant to build views* Sejin and Sushias crypticness of the conversation other than the financial part gives the audience an understanding that she might need some form of help* Despite there seeming to be some confusion on their actual state, Sushia said they were broke up which would let the audience know she was single.* She also plugged her account a few time (All though I'm sure most people would do the same)* Once Darius left the call, Both Sejin and Sushia seemed to lose interest and left the call which would imply that they had no other reason to stay. * Destiny ending the conversation with this vague message **But hey thats just a theory, A drama theory!**",1945,355,0.9349,0.093,0.784,0.123

Just because the external can shape the internal does not justify your dogmatic views. Would anyone be the same person if you got in a time machine and placed them on a remote island at birth. I doubt it. Their experiences and outlook on life would be completely different. Is the person on the desert island and the one left to live as he was the same person? I don't think so.  So in a way yes you are correct. I probably wouldn't be trans if I was a completely different person. Because that would not be me. So why the fuck does it matter. It's not me. I'm a person who was born at certain time and place and was brought up in a certain way. You are talking to me not the hypothetical cave man in your imagination. Other mental illnesses can also be caused by external factors and you could make the same analogy but it's weird how people only focus on gender dysphoria. Almost like theres an alterior motive. Is seasonal affective disorder not real too? Something that is caused completely by the external environment.I know what your thinking. Okay so the external shapes internal. That means I can be talked out of, manipulated or brainwashed out being trans. I'm gonna answer your question with another question. Why does this need to be done to me? I'm transitioning and have been on HRT for about 1 and half years. Why do you feel the need to take a person who has expressed content in their current situation and bring them into a situation of uncertainty? Surely this is in some way immoral isn't it? How do you know what you are doing will end well in the long run? Another concern if I was undergoing gender conversion therapy would be losing a fundamental piece of myself. For me my I've had gender dysphoria since I was about 12. These thoughts of who I am and my identity have been a part of me for so long. So who am I after the gender conversion therapy is a success.

9180,Destiny,"Unaddressed ERRORS within the coding of TATE STANDS If DESTINY wants me to accept SNEAKO (or most Manosphere Tate cucks) as intelligent I need to hear their responses to the following points. Some of these aren't even brought up by Destiny. Having thought a bit about Tate, I have found some serious gaps in his motivation and logic. Of course the inconsistencies can be explained by accepting the characterization of Tate as a gossip, cheat, and sex trafficker. Regardless, here are the five main ERRORS that those damn TATE\_STAND\_BOT.exe are susceptible to: 1. Tate IS the western degenerate bringing degeneracy and immorality to the purer nation he covets. Tate is a vector of infection. Maybe he should be made to wear a mask. He likes Romania for being less degenerate than the West, but his stated goal of parking his business there is to spread sexual degeneracy, gambling, and hedonism as a philosophy. Tate, as an American and a Westerner, claims to value chastity in women, and agency in men. The West is losing these values and that is WHY he is abandoning his roots and moving. But what does he bring to Romania? Investment in their business? Even a media spotlight to stoke interest in Romanian culture? No, he buys and opens Casinos, and starts a scummy sex cam business. He is spreading our degenerate Western taint. 2. Tate is actively making the world worse, according to himself. If Tate values people with self control, women with low body counts, and nations with strong morals, his actions actively consume, corrupt or degrade those valued principals. Tate runs casinos which prey upon people without discipline. Tate actively lowers (or consumes I guess) the sexual value of as many women as possible. Tate lowers the moral character of the polity he inhabits by bribing people and flaunting the laws of a nation. This is not manly; he isn't improving, teaching, or constructing anything, he's simply taking advantage of those who are vulnerable. He acts less like a man, and more like a predator. He acts like this, almost entirely to slake his own hedonistic desires for material goods and pleasurable sensations.3. (This actually got picked up on recently) IF Tate IS challenging a shadowy cabal of ultra wealthy  oligarchs (with his words), then going to a nation where, according to his own analysis; money corrupts the legal process and can move police. Then he's taking a huge risk for no reason. Not ONLY that but he's moving AWAY from nations where the court system is less corruptible, and free speech laws are the strongest. If he has aligned against the matrix and the elite (who are globalists remember, implying they have global reach) going to corruptible places with harsher courts is fucking mistake.4. How is it intelligent or helpful to shit talk endlessly? If you are trying to get away with crime and you have ties to the mafia and want to take advantage of a corruptible nation, and you want to do all this and be left in PEACE. The WORST thing you could do would be to draw attention to yourself, your criminal friends (who you call criminal), and piss off a corrupt authority. There's no long term gain to shit talking Romania justice, or crowing about your mafia ties. I'm a fucking rando DDGer and even I know that the number one rule of the Mafia (and fight club) is to NOT TALK ABOUT THE MAFIA.  5. Tate is a globalist. By every metric he is a globalist. He shops around nations for the best goods and services, most favorable tax zones, and most malleable justice systems. He exploits his ability to move his money, property, people (and hoes) across borders to confuse legal systems and enrich himself. These are options for wealth generation that nearly no commoner will ever have access to. He does this while preying upon those beneath him. He does this entirely at the expense of the common people and the civilization others are trying to maintain. What's the outcome? His goal?  What he spends all his resources on? Merely the consumption of as many luxuries as possible to fulfill his hedonistic desires. Tate is the very definition of a scummy globalist. So shouldn't SNEAKO hate him? Or does SNEAKO admire him? Does SNEAKO really, secretly, just want to be part of the ultra wealthy globalist club? Because it seems to me if SNEAKO wants to be like TATE, not even wholly in character, but to have that level of money and movement and power... Then the boy is just buttmad he isn't in the club. Tate is like the worst kind of hedonist who NEEDS that quick, immediate dose of dopamine. He's kind of interesting in that he has the discipline to become a champion fighter, but is NOT disciplined enough to avoid spending money on TOO MANY cars, and can't resist the social dopamine hit of running his mouth. It's like there's a very specific type of pleasure he gets from social interactions or being paid attention too (probably validation from others), that has poisoned his soul and rotted his mind. But remember, he DOES have the self control (or DID at one point) to become a top athlete.  It's also kind of sad that the MANOSPHERE has groomed Tate into a lolcow. There is little worse than a  LEGION of sycophants who declare you as a flawless (orange) god-king and thought leader. They've fattened up Tate's ego until he's nice tubby piggy ready for public slaughter. Much like Brittany spears, the public has raised him up onto an idol, but now, the time of harvest has come. People who cared about Tate (assuming he wouldn't jettison them from his orbit) would probably have urged him to quiet down a bunch, think, and stop drawing attention to himself as he quietly buys more casinos, converts to Islam and marries five super models. I think deep down the manosphere knows that Tate is a ripe lolcow and are coming to terms with the joke being over.  I want to know if there are any other DGGers who have spotted some unaddressed ERRORS in the programming of TATE\_STAND\_BOT.exe. Do you find these five errors compelling? I bet you can't force those damn bots to address any of them.",6053,1054,0.9976,0.103,0.729,0.168

9190,Destiny,"A low-effort Evil_Fossil Hate-thread The community's perception on Evil\_Fossil is that he's a bit of a fun schizo who bankrolls Destiny's stream. After all, he won DGGer of the year. His general mindset with regard to Destiny can generally be described in this youtube comment. He essentially believes that Destiny is a hedonistic demon-worshipper and wants to talk to him to save him from sin. I'm sure some better loremasters can better explain him, but the goal of this post is to start a conversation on Evil\_Fossil in this community rather than be a perfect effort post. But regardless, he's mentally unhinged and the way he donos and interacts with the stream isn't healthy.According to August, Evil\_Fossil was one of the reasons Dan distanced himself from this community. Evil\_Fossil would generally donate weird shit about Dan, but most interesting is the twitlonger that Evil\_Fossil wrote. The Twitlonger is written in schizonese but calling him a ""leech"", ""human filth"" and wanting to ""obliterate"" him is very sus. In addition here is this comment by Evil\_Fossil saying  ""that Dan needs to LOSE in his life in order to finally WIN"" is very weird. While they aren't exactly 1:1 death threats, these messages are incredibly offputting. It makes sense why Dan might be unnerved, and why he and RTBA asked for Evil\_Fossil to be removed from the community.RTBA, who has made himself known as not liking Evil\_Fossil, stated that Evil\_Fossil abuses his girlfriend revealed to us through his discussions with Mr. Girl on his hotline show. I don't have any links for those segments, so it's just hearsay but the bear went so far as to DM MrGirl to ban Evil\_Fossil from that show because of his abusive tendencies. I never watched MrGirl's call-in shows, but if any loremasters want to give links in the comments that would be appreciated. This Twitlonger is also pretty weird once you get past the schizonese, in the context that Evil\_Fossil might be an abuser, the way that the talks about his girlfriend certainly paints an abusive relationship.

9206,Destiny,"Is the argument over immigration different in northern European countries, such as the Scandinavian nations, when compared to more western nations like the UK or the US? I've been having discussions with some right leaning (arguably VERY right leaning) European friends after they learned that I am a ""leftist"" (not really sure if SocDems are really leftists, but from their perspective I am indistinguishable from a communist) and the topic of immigration came up. The conversation moves from one about economics (essentially inarguable that immigrants are a boost to the economy) and one about culture and crime rates. I made a pretty standard argument that while crime rate is higher in immigrants, that is due to the fact that immigrants are disproportionally poor when compared to the native population, and that poverty is a far stronger correlative property with regards to crime rather than cultural or racial ties. They started raging at me, and accusing me of thinking everything that is true for western countries cannot be applied to those European countries (I think in the argument we were talking specifically about Finland). The convo really didn't progress much past that point, I tried looking some things up, and found that the immigrant nationality with the highest crime rate in Finland were actually Swedish immigrants, and that just as in the west, immigrants tended to be poorer than natives. They just responded that while immigrants were poorer, they still had better benefits than western immigrants so it isn't really comparable, and then the convo died.So, anyone knowledgeable here able to clarify for me? Was I actually talking out my ass? Are arguments for immigration from a western perspective not at all applicable in the northern European countries, specifically Scandinavia?

9214,Destiny,"Onereason people defend Andrew Tate is because most men were never fully convinced that being a pimp is wrong In the 90s and early 2000s, pimps were hot. Chappelle's Show, Pimp Juice, Snoop Dogg's aesthetic. I remember I didn't even understand what a pimp was as a kid, I thought it was just a cool black guy who dressed flamboyantly. I think people (women) assumed that with the metoo thing and more universal understandings of consent that society has suddenly agreed that being a pimp is gross and uncool. An interview with a pimp that is pretty much applicable to Tate's defense, obviously cam work is very different from traditional prostitution, I'm not comparing them.Even if Andrew Tate is proven guilty of everything he is accused of, most will not turn on him even if they suspect he is guilty. Because to them, being a pimp is cool, it's masculine, it's entrepreneurial and it projects power. It is the logical endpoint of Andrew Tate and Red Pill ideology as a whole to want to be a pimp, to have many young, attractive, probably unintelligent women who fuck you and spend the rest of their time making you money and proving how smitten they are with you. You keep your women on an allowance, indulge in all the finer things yourself and keep doing this well into your 40s.

9229,Destiny,"Don't listen to Destiny when it comes to filter inserters/filter splitters Yes, the filtering feature on splitters is incredibly powerful. Yes, they basically invalidate the existence of filter inserters. That does not mean that splitter filters are unethical and you should play without them.Firstly, this isn't a big deal in vanilla Factorio as there's only like 2 cases where you would be forced to deal with having multiple products on the same belt (Nuclear ore refinement and mining when deposits are located adjacent to each other). In all other cases if you're trying to filter items on a belt you should probably instead refactor things so the products are all staying on separate belts to begin with.Secondly, when I admitted that splitters are much stronger than inserters, that is mainly because filter inserters are much weaker than they first appear. Consider the problem you want to solve with filter inserters that you would typically solve with a splitter: a belt is mostly one product, but a small amount of byproduct is taking up some of the belt (say, 33% of the belt, or 15 items per second on a blue belt). You may think that a filter inserter with stack size 2 and a rotation speed of 832¬∞ would be able to move (832¬∞ / 360¬∞ \* 2 products per rotation) \~4.62 products per second, so about 4 inserters to catch all the byproduct (already way more expensive in products and space than a splitter), and you'd be wrong. Filter rotation speed only applies when a filter is rotating, meaning it had products to pull grab, and a place to put the products, i.e. when it's pulling from a container to a container, or maybe a container to an empty, fast belt, which is very different from this problem of belt -&gt; belt transport. Any time the belt they're pulling from doesn't have the product it's looking for, the inserter is idle, any time the destination belt is full of other products, the belt will be idle, so they functionally have a reduced rotation speed as they wait for enough product to fill up their stack size and wait for space in their destination to place the product, and the actual rate of transport is very swingy and hard to plan around.Then we have to consider the actual rate of byproduct on the mixed belt. We were assuming 33% of the belt is filled with byproduct, but there's no way that's going to be evenly distributed, and large factories deal with literally millions of products and dozens of production lines that have to run without issue or the player will quickly be spending all their playtime micromanaging and putting out fires instead of actually building their factory, so we have to plan around super unlucky 1% scenarios of like 50 byproducts all coming in one second, or else byproduct squeaking through our inserters will eventually backup the belt and ruin the whole production line (most production lines start to significantly break after only one or two incorrect inputs).The initial estimate of about 4 inserters to replace 1 splitter quickly balloons to like 6 or 7, then again to like a dozen or more, and don't forget you need belt space on the input *and output* of all those inserters.This would make filtering byproducts into far and away the most difficult and confusing problem in all of (vanilla) Factorio for a player to solve, and one they could potentially deal with in the first few hours of the game. Then it would become something that only occurs optionally in the super late game in a production problem that is already the current most-complex process in all of Factorio (so much so that it intimidated Destiny into staying away from it for literally hundreds of hours of vanilla Factorio and Space Exploration gameplay).That is why the developers created splitter filtering and added it to the game even though it invalidated the previously existing filter inserters.",3851,663,-0.6793,0.066,0.868,0.066

9242,Destiny,"The prosecutors of Andrew Tate leaked to the Romanian press a number of transcripts of wiretapped conversations held among the victims, the Tates and the 2 women arrested. The transcripts contain admissions of criminality, manipulation, violent threats and more corroborating victim testimony It has become the most common talking point among Tate's supporters, and even his own lawyer, to say that there is actually zero proof of any of the allegations made against the Tates. It has been widely known in Romania for a week now that this is simply not the case, since the prosecution has leaked a number of snippets from wiretapped transcripts they obtained during their investigation.These transcripts were used, along with the victim statements, expert psychological reports of the victims and Andrew Tate's own words published to social media in public videos to convince the Judge that there is at least a reasonable suspicion that the defendants committed the crimes of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group, while the judge asked for more evidence of the rape accusation (it is notoriously difficult to prove rape, especially if said rape happened a long time ago).One of the defence strategies Tate's lawyer used was to say that Tate was simply playing a character, or persona, in his videos so the videos shouldn't be used as evidence. However, the judge disagreed with this defence as the wiretapped transcripts obtained by prosecutors showed Tate with the same attitude and personality in private messages between himself and the victims and others.I will layout all of the transcripts that have been leaked so far along with the sources for each transcript, they have been translated from Romanian using Google translate.TRANSCRIPT 1: Andrew Tate manipulates one of the victims into flying to Romania by promising marriage, then discusses said victim as a commodity to be used for making money.Source: Conversation 1 (promise of marriage):Emory (Andrew Tate): You have to understand that once you're mine, you'll be mine forever. A woman never leaves her man. I will be the last man in your life.Emory: what do we do if we fall in love and I kidnap you to bring you to Bucharest?  Girl: I don't think it's kidnapping, if I want to come.Emory: first I have to see in your eyes that you will never be able to live without me. And then I can trust you to show you everything  Girl: Bring a ring with you when you come üòäEmory: Can you be loving enough to be a wife? To always be by my side, wherever I go? Talk to 0 men besides me? Ride or die? üòäEmory: you have to move to Romania with me, to keep an eye on you.  Emory: You're mine. Do not forget that. And act like it. We will be together soon.  Girl: but can I trust you?  Emory: Yes. You can.  Emory: You will move to Romania with me. I plan when I get there. First, I might have to go to Prague for a few days.  Emory: and we meet in Romania.Emory: and I want to know that you are committed  Emory: Serious about marriage.  Girl: Yes. I am serious.Conversation 2 (discussion of victim as a commodity, PI in this context is one of the women who was arrested along with Tate):ANDREW TATE: Did you tell the new one that you make a lot of money?  ANDREW TATE: ask her to take pictures of you  PI: yes.  PI: you mean me and her in the pictures?  ANDREW TATE: yes  PI: what kind of pictures?  ANDREW TATE: anything for onlyfans  PI: in underwear? She won't  ANDREW TATE: seePI: G talked to her today and will go live with B tonight to tryANDREW TATE: And with Tristan's new girl you're doing a really good job  ANDREW TATE: Tristan wants you to bring her back and stay there  ANDREW TATE: I'm taking care of B and U tomorrow, we have to be alone and find a solution to to stay"".  PI:. does she know about onlyfans?TRISTAN TATE: no  TRISTAN TATE: and she's studying to be a lawyer, she doesn't care  TRISTAN TATE: and she never would  PI:. know. She asked me to show her my TikTok and I wasn't sure.TRANSCRIPT 2: Supports the prosecutions case that Andrew Tate is the leader of the organised criminal group and there is a hierarchy with Andrew Tate at the topSource: Conversation 1:Girl: I heard you're the one running the OnlyFans and TikTok girls business.  Andrew Tate: Tristan and Georgiana are there, but I lead themConversation 2 (Radu Luana to one of the victims demanding money and saying that the victim is accountable to her, she is accountable to Tristan and Tristan is accountable to Andrew, the hierarchy of the criminal group is demonstrated):Radu Luana: The money from yesterday, 3 dollars  Radu Luana: Give me something, I'm foaming at the mouth  Radu Luana: That at the end of the month Andrew will argue with Tristan Tate, Tristan Tate with me and I with youConversation 3 (Andrew tells the victim not to leave the house without one of the 3 trusted employees (Tristan, and the 2 ""angels"" arrested) following and watching her, making a clear threat despite the victim pleading that she wants to leave the house alone:Andrew Tate: You don't go anywhere without one of the three (trusted employee nos).Young woman: Why are you so cold to me?Andrew Tate: Don't go out alone without telling me.Andrew Tate: Mall, supermarket, nowhere from now on.Young woman: I told you I wanted to go aloneAndrew Tate: It's the last warning!TRANSCRIPT 3: Andrew Tate admits to victim that he ""has to hide"" what he is really doing and that he does money laundering, exploiting women by using them to do illegal activities for him such as moving money and illegal items/documents, he also claims ""he would never do that"" to the victim, presumably another form of manipulation to make the victim feel ""special"" and that he ""cares"" about her:Source: Andrew Tate : You're not stupid and you can probably guess how I make so much money. I have to hide what I'm really doing.Victim : Web cam?Andrew Tate : I've been doing this for a long time with a team of girls working on video chat. The company was fake, but this is how I laundered my dirty money. Some of the girls who worked for me (...) I used them to do other things.

Occasionally he‚Äôll talk about how he has ‚Äúperfect peace‚Äù but never explains further and rarely actually talks about it. I was only able to find 2 instances where he does delve into it deeper -Interview with Stefan Molyneux when describing what perfect peace is:‚ÄúIt is no conflict within. You have no doubt, no fear, no worry, no second thoughts. your mind body and soul within is at peace. You no longer have peaks or valleys emotionally. And it doesn‚Äôt matter what happens in the world around you or what‚Äôs happening to you. It‚Äôs just a situation.¬† And because of that peace you can see it‚Äôs not happening to you. It‚Äôs just a situation you have to deal with. You don‚Äôt identify with the situation at all. No matter what it is....There is a war happening between good and evil. And in our mind is an evil battle between the mind and the soul in our belly. Our real self. But if you realize that within yourself‚Ä¶ but if you let that happen without identifying with it then the real you will emerge....In that fallen state they can‚Äôt see. Because they‚Äôve identified with that evil \[the mind/ego\]. They believe that it‚Äôs them. They don‚Äôt realize that there‚Äôs another identity that‚Äôs made a home in them. And it works in their mind and feeling. And they identify with the mind believing that their thoughts are their own. And so if you believe that your thoughts are your own you will be controlled by it. But when you start to realize that you are not your thoughts and you don‚Äôt create thoughts then the real you observe the not you and that‚Äôs when you can win the battle.‚ÄùFrom a random caller: ""In real reality you don‚Äôt have any problem. It‚Äôs only in the illusion that you have problems. It‚Äôs just that you believed a thought and had a feeling about the thought and then call it a problem. But if you stopped believing in the imagination you‚Äôd never have a problem....All thoughts except for practical thoughts are evil. The ones you think are good thoughts are not. because it just a set-up. It‚Äôll tell you ‚ÄúOh you a king. Or you a queen‚Äù. Only for you to be disappointed later. And all bad thoughts are a set up and is evil. So don't judge them, just watch them. And once you do that you will start to live your real life.""Anyways thought that this was interesting. Usually people from Buddhist traditions talk about this.

In particular there are two events in history that is ingrained in Israeli identity. The first is the Yom Kippur War in '73. After the '67 war meantioned above the world community denounced the attack of Israel, even though Israel had substantial cause to invade because Israels safety was at stake. Just as in '67, in '73 the Israeli inteligence had evidence for a upcoming invasion. But this time Israel was discourged by the US to do a preemtive strike again.This lead to the Yom Kippur war, where Israel was pretty near to annihilation. Every time someone meations Israel as this great empireal power, I remember that it is not self-evident that Israel exists today.The second event was the unilateral retreat from Gaza. Israel withdrawing from Gaza was the nearest thing to the end of the Israeli occupation of Palestine. I believe that it was like a test run for the whole withdraw from the west bank. But this blew up in Israels face. Instead of a peaceful neighbor they got Hamas.From this point on it was really hard as an Israeli leftists to campaign for compromise. As a Israeli leftist you stand alone: The Israeli right-wing calls you unrealistic, the western left sides with Palestinians.How do you expect a left government to form if you don¬¥t have any allies?I want to add that I am in no way downplaying the harm of the new Israeli government. All I am saying is that up untill this point the Palestinian Authority and the Arab governments were the biggest obstacle to peace and the western left failed (or didn¬¥t want) to see it.Please let me know what your opinion is on this issue.",2291,388,-0.971,0.143,0.76,0.097

9279,Destiny,"[Effort Post] AI Misconceptions As an ML researcher, I love the broader discussion that machine learning models like GPTChat and DALL-E receive. My hope in this post is to clear up some incorrect talking points that I often see in pop-sci discussions that people have about ML. So here we go!##Misconception: We have no idea how deep learning models work!Incorrect! For most models we have pretty good understanding and theories on how they work. What people mean to say is that their parameters are not very interpretable.When we look at different neural architectures, such as fully connected networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers and so on, we have a really good understanding of what these models are capable of, what sorts of things the networks are capable of learning, and a general understanding of ‚Äúhow is any of this possible?!‚ÄùWhat people mean to say is that individual parameters of the network are not very interpretable. I learn nothing by opening up the text file of GPT-3‚Äôs  175 billion parameter. I can understand how it works, and I can perform experiments to try to understand what specific layers/attention heads tend to do, but I will not be able to tell you what any individual parameter of the network is doing. I especially won‚Äôt be able to tell you what the implications are between parameters across layers. This is often misrepresented as ‚Äúwe have no idea how deep learning works!‚Äù Not true.##Misconception: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) learn just like we do!Incorrect! Pretty much everything about how a neural network learns is different than how we learn.The general way an ANN learns is you give it a batch of random training examples, and you look at how wrong the ANNs results are. You then use some calculus to adjust the ANNs parameters so that it produces better answers next time. Alternatively, we have no idea how a human brain learns. We know it‚Äôs not the backprop algorithm that ANNs use[1]. We have some notion that an important learning task for brains is ‚Äúwhat happens next?‚Äù[2] - but we don‚Äôt understand the specific mechanisms or the specific Hebbian learning rules at play.On top of that, an incredibly important difference is that a biological network are (almost) always given temporally correlated input. Input at time T is shortly followed by input at time T+1. This leads to an important ordering of biological network‚Äôs ‚Äútraining data‚Äù that probably has some pretty significant consequences. ##Misconception: ANNs learn the same sorts of things we do!Incorrect! Mostly‚Ä¶There are some things where this statement is actually true! Importantly, the cortical vision structure of human brains seem to do similar things that specific layers/kernels do in a CNN[3]. It also seems like there are some analogous activations between the neurons in the hippocampus and attention between tokens in a Transformer[4].  However, it also appears that brains have structure that specifically makes it easy for them to learn symbolic relationships. Alternatively, ANNs don‚Äôt have an inductive bias that allows them to easily capture symbolic relationships.The result is that a child can learn grammatical structures with very few training examples [5.], where as a neural network needs billions of training examples to learn the same symbolic relationships. The sort of statistical representation that large language models (LLMs) build trying to capture symbolic relationships are shockingly powerful, but also have severe limitations, especially around the distributional tails of language [6].A person can learn a new language with a few well written text books - even when that language is distant from their native tongue. However, LLMs seem to have a lot of difficulty producing similar quality of text /translation when the new language is far from their training set [6/7].The expectation of the field is that this problem doesn‚Äôt improve by just making LLMs bigger. It seems like we need a specific sort of inductive bias to be able to learn symbolic systems efficiently.##Misconception: Artificial neurons are pretty similar to biological neurons!Incorrect! Artificial neurons are dumb. Real dumb. I‚Äôd go so far as to call them remedial. The way they work is by taking a weighted sum of their inputs and adding a bias. Mathematically speaking, they can only learn affine functions. An artificial neuron is able to learn ‚ÄúThe mean of A and B‚Äù,  but it is impossible for them to learn ‚ÄúA or B, but not A and B‚Äù.Alternatively, biological neurons are incredibly smart. They are amazingly adept at learning important relationships between their synapses (and typically biological neurons have more synapses [connections] than their artificial analogues), and they also don‚Äôt have the same sort of mathematical limitations that artificial neurons do.A biological neuron is more analogous to an entire ANN than an individual artificial neuron - and its actually a surprisingly difficult task to use ML models to learn the various functions of individual neurons [8].##Misconception: ANNs are pretty similar to biological neural networks!Incorrect! There are many hugely significant differences, the most important of which (in my opinion) is that ANNs optimize for signal (A mistake for an ANN neuron is outputting 0.7 when it should have out put 0.72), whereas biological networks optimize for time (A mistake for a biological neuron is spiking at time T instead time T+0.03 s).This is a huuuuuuge difference. Spiking neural networks (which optimize in the time space) are a huge mystery to us - and while we have had some forward progress in toy examples [9] we haven‚Äôt had a lot. This seems really important, and possibly important for symbolic thinking and deep thought in general.I can think, and think, and think, and then I can think some more. On the other hand, an ANN can pass its input through N layers, and then is done. There is some research on using continuous processing in ANNs - however, it‚Äôs unclear that we will reach biological level results of continuous processing without using spiking networks - and there are so many problems that make researching artificial spiking networks a huge pain.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Those are the some of big misconceptions that I‚Äôve noticed.

A big goal of the current anti ai art movement is to make it unlawful to train AI without the explicit consent of the artists. Sounds simple enough right? Just don't mindlessly download images off the internet when you train your AI.Ok then, what would if someone accuse you of using an ""unethically sourced"" AI (assuming you actually used one)?I mean sure, for the same reason it's easy to spot good old human-plagiarized work , it's as easy to spot people who are using AI to do the same. But we're looking at output in those situations.But as soon as the process becomes a bit more complex, it becomes impossible to prove at 100% that a copyrighted work was used. At a certain point, all the input source become mixed enough that none of them can be recognized . This level of complexity is something that even the current generation of AI work easily reach.So how you fix an impossible problem? By implementing a half-baked, feels good, solutions calling it done. And of course that ""solution"" will make everything worse.Here's my prediction if anti-ai crowd gets their wish   - The law will add just enough roadblocks to AI training so that the only companies with billions in their bank account will be able to implement them  - The legal process to prove someone ""wrongful use of AI"" will be long enough and costly enough so that only companies with billions in their bank account will be able to sue for that.  - The same artists that will think copyright laws will protect them will probably end up being sued by Disney because their art will trigger a (soon to be developed) ai thief detection bot.",1812,327,0.8963,0.058,0.853,0.089

9333,Destiny,"Pacifism and the War. Relevant for today's debate (Schizo-Pseudo-Effort Post) The other day I was reading a short essay by George Orwell called Pacifism and the War (published in *Partisan Review*. ‚Äî GB, London. ‚Äî August-September 1942), I found it to be very relevant to the topic of the Ukraine War. Even if both conflicts are not comparable in scale, and Russia is hardly the Nazis, I think Orwell's observations are uncannily similar to the situation happening today in Europe and the US.I'm not very familiar with these guys Destiny is set to debate today, but he shouldn't let them get away with feigning pacifism in a way to support Russia. Just as Orwell mentions how one of the three men whom he argues with condemns every war measure taken by the Allies, but fails to mention Nazi aggression or its invasion of the Soviet Union a single time, I expect these Fascist shills to denounce all violence enacted by the Ukrainian state while failing to mention any violence enacted by the Russian state.This co-opting of pacifism by violent ideologies to denounce the Liberal Democracies that intervene on behalf of nations being invaded and defaced by the states these ideologies wield as hammers of war is a century old.To end my rambles I feel Orwell is almost talking to the modern audience in the two last sentences of his essay, and I will share them:*""... That is on par\* with ‚Äòpeace‚Äô propaganda which has to avoid mention of Hitler‚Äôs invasion of Russia\*, and it is not what I mean by intellectual honesty. It is just because I do take the function of the intelligentsia seriously that I don‚Äôt like the sneers, libels, parrot phrased and financially profitable back-scratching which flourish in our English literary world, and perhaps in yours also.""*PS: The \* indicates I corrected grammatical mistakes made by the person who transcribed the essay to the internet seemingly in a hurry.PSS: Orwell's essay is really short, even if you don't read the post you should read the essay.PSSS: Reddit wouldn't allow me to post the link so I posted the essay below as a spoiler.Essay:&gt;!About a year ago I and a number of others were engaged in broadcasting literary programmes to India, and among other things we broadcast a good deal of verse by contemporary and near-contemporary English writers ‚Äî for example, Eliot, Herbert Read, Auden, Spender, Dylan Thomas, Henry Treece, Alex Comfort, Robert Bridges, Edmund Blunden, D. H. Lawrence. Whenever it was possible we had poems broadcast by the people who wrote them. Just why these particular programmes (a small and remote out-flanking movement in the radio war) were instituted there is no need to explain here, but I should add that the fact that we were broadcasting to an Indian audience dictated our technique to some extent. The essential point was that our literary broadcasts were aimed at the Indian university students, a small and hostile audience, unapproachable by anything that could be described as British propaganda. It was known in advance that we could not hope for more than a few thousand listeners at the most, and this gave us an excuse to be more ‚Äòhighbrow‚Äô than is generally possible on the air.!&lt;&gt;!Since I don‚Äôt suppose you want to fill an entire number of P.R. (Partisan Review) with squalid controversies imported from across the Atlantic, I will lump together the various letters you have sent on to me (from Messrs Savage, Woodcock and Comfort), as the central issue in all of them is the same. But I must afterwards deal separately with some points of fact raised in various of the letters.!&lt;&gt;!Pacifism. Pacifism is objectively pro-Fascist. This is elementary common sense. If you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, ‚Äòhe that is not with me is against me‚Äô. The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle, while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you, is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security. Mr Savage remarks that ‚Äòaccording to this type of reasoning, a German or Japanese pacifist would be ‚Äúobjectively pro-British‚Äù.‚Äô But of course he would be! That is why pacifist activities are not permitted in those countries (in both of them the penalty is, or can be, beheading) while both the Germans and the Japanese do all they can to encourage the spread of pacifism in British and American territories. The Germans even run a spurious ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô station which serves out pacifist propaganda indistinguishable from that of the P.P.U. They would stimulate pacifism in Russia as well if they could, but in that case they have tougher babies to deal with. In so far as it takes effect at all, pacifist propaganda can only be effective against those countries where a certain amount of freedom of speech is still permitted; in other words it is helpful to totalitarianism.!&lt;&gt;!I am not interested in pacifism as a ‚Äòmoral phenomenon‚Äô. If Mr Savage and others imagine that one can somehow ‚Äòovercome‚Äô the German army by lying on one‚Äôs back, let them go on imagining it, but let them also wonder occasionally whether this is not an illusion due to security, too much money and a simple ignorance of the way in which things actually happen. As an ex-Indian civil servant, it always makes me shout with laughter to hear, for instance, Gandhi named as an example of the success of non-violence. As long as twenty years ago it was cynically admitted in Anglo-Indian circles that Gandhi was very useful to the British government. So he will be to the Japanese if they get there. Despotic governments can stand ‚Äòmoral force‚Äô till the cows come home; what they fear is physical force. But though not much interested in the ‚Äòtheory‚Äô of pacifism, I am interested in the psychological processes by which pacifists who have started out with an alleged horror of violence end up with a marked tendency to be fascinated by the success and power of Nazism. Even pacifists who wouldn‚Äôt own to any such fascination are beginning to claim that a Nazi victory is desirable in itself. In the letter you sent on to me, Mr Comfort considers that an artist in occupied territory ought to ‚Äòprotest against such evils as he sees‚Äô, but considers that this is best done by ‚Äòtemporarily accepting the status quo‚Äô (like D√©at or Bergery, for instance?). a few weeks back he was hoping for a Nazi victory because of the stimulating effect it would have upon the arts:!&lt;&gt;!As far as I can see, no therapy short of complete military defeat has any chance of re-establishing the common stability of literature and of the man in the street. One can imagine the greater the adversity the greater the sudden realization of a stream of imaginative work, and the greater the sudden katharsis of poetry, from the isolated interpretation of war as calamity to the realization of the imaginative and actual tragedy of Man. When we have access again to the literature of the war years in France, Poland and Czechoslovakia, I am confident that that is what we shall fined. (From a letter to Horizon.)!&lt;&gt;!I pass over the money-sheltered ignorance capable of believing that literary life is still going on in, for instance, Poland, and remark merely that statements like this justify me in saying that our English pacifists are tending towards active pro-Fascism. But I don‚Äôt particularly object to that. What I object to is the intellectual cowardice of people who are objectively and to some extent emotionally pro-Fascist, but who don‚Äôt care to say so and take refuge behind the formula ‚ÄòI am just as anti-fascist as anyone, but‚Äî‚Äô. The result of this is that so-called peace propaganda is just as dishonest and intellectually disgusting as war propaganda. Like war propaganda, it concentrates on putting forward a ‚Äòcase‚Äô, obscuring the opponent‚Äôs point of view and avoiding awkward questions. The line normally followed is ‚ÄòThose who fight against Fascism go Fascist themselves.‚Äô In order to evade the quite obvious objections that can be raised to this, the following propaganda-tricks are used:!&lt;1. &gt;!The Fascizing processes occurring in Britain as a result of war are systematically exaggerated.!&lt;2. &gt;!The actual record of Fascism, especially its pre-war history, is ignored or pooh-poohed as ‚Äòpropaganda‚Äô. Discussion of what the world would actually be like if the Axis dominated it is evaded.!&lt;3. &gt;!Those who want to struggle against Fascism are accused of being wholehearted defenders of capitalist ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô. The fact that the rich everywhere tend to be pro-Fascist and the working class are nearly always anti-Fascist is hushed up.!&lt;4. &gt;!It is tacitly pretended that the war is only between Britain and Germany. Mention of Russia and China, and their fate if Fascism is permitted to win, is avoided. (You won‚Äôt find one word about Russia or China in the three letters you sent to me.)!&lt;&gt;!Now as to one or two points of fact which I must deal with if your correspondents‚Äô letters are to be printed in full.!&lt;&gt;!My past and present. Mr Woodcock tries to discredit me by saying that (a) I once served in the Indian Imperial Police, (b) I have written article for the Adelphi and was mixed up with the Trotskyists in Spain, and (c) that I am at the B.B.C. ‚Äòconducting British propaganda to fox the Indian masses‚Äô. With regard to (a), it is quite true that I served five years in the Indian Police. It is also true that I gave up that job, partly because it didn‚Äôt suit me but mainly because I would not any longer be a servant of imperialism. I am against imperialism because I know something about it from the inside. The whole history of this is to be found in my writings, including a novel (Burmese Days) which I think I can claim was a kind of prophecy of what happened this year in Burma. (b) Of course I have written for the Adelphi. Why not? I once wrote an article for a vegetarian paper. Does that make me a vegetarian? I was associated with the Trotskyists in Spain. It was chance that I was serving in the P.O.U.M. militia and not another, and I largely disagreed with the P.O.U. M. ‚Äòline‚Äô and told its leaders so freely, but when they were afterwards accused of pro-Fascist activities I defended them as best it could. How does this contradict my present anti-Hitler attitude? It is news to me that Trotskyists are either pacifists or pro-Fascists. (c) Does Mr Woodcock really know what kind of stuff I put out in the Indian broadcasts? He does not ‚Äî though I would be quite glad to tell him about it. He is careful not to mention what other people are associated with these Indian broadcasts. One for instance is Herbert Read, whom he mentions with approval. Others are T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, Reginald Reynolds, Stephen Spender, J. B. S. Haldane, Tom Wintringham. Most of our broadcasters are Indian left-wing intellectual, from Liberals to Trotskyists, some of them bitterly anti-British. They don‚Äôt do it to ‚Äòfox the Indian masses‚Äô but because they know what a Fascist victory would mean to the chances of India‚Äôs independence. Why not try to find out what I am doing before accusing my good faith?!&lt;&gt;!‚ÄòMr Orwell is intellectual-hunting again‚Äô (Mr Comfort). I have never attacked ‚Äòthe intellectuals‚Äô or ‚Äòthe intelligentsia‚Äô en bloc. I have used a lot of ink and done myself a lot of harm by attacking the successive literary cliques which have infested this country, not because they were intellectuals but precisely because they were not what I mean by true intellectuals. The life of a clique is about five years and I have been writing long enough to see three of them come and two go ‚Äî the Catholic gang, the Stalinist gang, and the present pacifist or, as they are sometimes nicknamed, Fascifist gang. My case against all of them is that they write mentally dishonest propaganda and degrade literary criticism to mutual arse-licking. But even with these various schools I would differentiate between individuals. I would never think of coupling Christopher Dawson with Arnold Lunn, or Malraux with Palme Dutt, or Max Plowman with the Duke of Bedford. And even the work of one individual can exist at very different levels. For instance Mr Comfort himself wrote one poem I value greatly (‚ÄòThe Atoll in the Mind‚Äô), and I wish he would write more of them instead of lifeless propaganda tracts dressed up as novels. But his letter he has chosen to send you is a different matter. Instead of answering what I have said he tries to prejudice an audience to whom I am little known by a misrepresentation of my general line and sneers about my ‚Äòstatus‚Äô in England. (A writer isn‚Äôt judged by his ‚Äòstatus‚Äô, he is judged by his work.) That is on a par with ‚Äòpeace‚Äô propaganda which has to avoid mention of Hitler‚Äôs invasion of Russian, and it is not what I mean by intellectual honesty. It is just because I do take the function of the intelligentsia seriously that I don‚Äôt like the sneers, libels, parrot phrased and financially profitable back-scratching which flourish in our English literary world, and perhaps in yours also.!&lt;&gt;!1942!&lt;&gt;!  !&lt;&gt;!THE END!&lt;&gt;! !&lt;",13222,2244,-0.9931,0.128,0.76,0.113

9336,Destiny,"Seijn's Gambit: Why Dark Seijin's role as a dramatic anti-hero should increase his stocks. TLDR: ""Dark Seijin"" egging Darius on and chatting with his girl makes him a way more interesting character. After the lame Destiny PR discussions, Seijin as a villain takes a small W in my book. Darius came across as completely unhinged. Seijin being smug while possibly being slightly evil is just a much better look for him. Darius also vague posted significantly more than Seijin in the convo going as far as to call Sushia ""an abuser"" repeatedly. As most of you are aware, last night a dramatic call took place featuring Darius, Seijin, Supreme, Sushia and Ragepope (the second best orbiter after exskillsme rest his soul). So far this call has been characterized as a Seijin and Sushia L with Darius looking like a victim (if an unsympathetic one). A brief summary of the drama is as follows. Darius and Sushia had what could be characterized as an unpleasant breakup. Issues in their relationship that have been alluded to include Darius's alleged financial troubles and miss-management, Sushia possibly talking about personal issues that Darius is alleged to have had, Sushia likely sending explicit content to people she talks to including Seijin. Seijin is someone who Sushia is confirmed to have talked to at some length about something. Disagreement exists about the nature of these conversations. Darius accused Sushia of saying things about him that would have Seijin given a negative opinion about him. Sushia states that these conversations were about her problems and that Darius was not the primary topic of interest going as far to say that Darius was only mentioned in ""three sentences."" It is partially confirmed that Seijin helped Sushia with her only fans by transferring 7000 explicit photos. In the call, Darius described Seijin as a ""simp"" who was was sexual and/or romantically interested in Sushia. He accused Seijin of uncritically believing everything Sushia is purported to have said going as far to have called him a ""sex pest."" He also stated that he only lost $600 in the stock market. This was in response to Seijin vague posting the insult ""I just don't like when people drag other people down"" about Darius's financial mistakes. As an aside, I do not have complete access to Seijin chat logs. Seijin argued that Darius's general financial situation was generally already public knowledge and that he has always had a negative opinion of Darius which would indicate that his opinion was possibly only reinforced by Sushia's opinion. During the call, Ragepope was involved by egging both parties on. Some of the more inflammatory remarks include a comment asking ""if Seijin had ever masturbated to Sushia,"" and saying that ""if you stand under the hoop long enough..."" insinuating that Seijin was attempting to steal Darius's girl. Now as a few quick points to make. Steven's point that you shouldn't talk shit to lots of people about your partner is generally true. However, we don't know for sure the topics of conversation between Seijin and Darius. Darius says a lot on stream that Seijin could use to develop an opinion of him. We also don't know the timeline of when certain conversations were had. Having a conversations when you are together with someone as opposed to when you are there ex is different. That being said, Seijin was vague posting, which is an L in this community. However, Darius's reaction towards Sushia in the call put him in the worst light possible e.g. telling her to shut up while characterizing Seijin and Sushia's relationship in perhaps an unnecessarily negative light. While we can accuse Seijin of vague posting, Darius ""vague talked"" a lot on stream and thus without further details, we should rely more on Darius acting unhinged on the call. Sushia should be in the call when she is spoken negatively about. Darius also trauma dumped throughout the call. He wasn't saying ""someone died in his arms,"" but he did insinuate that Sushia fucked him mentally, gaslit him for a year, and was an abuser. He did more than equal Seijin in the vague posting. I personally, love watching people's lives just get ground to dust. Ragepope antagonizing both sides is a true modern classic. Darius came in style (as usual) and I hope to see him go through more messy breakups in the future...  I'm really enjoying the new ""dark Seijin.""

At worst, you could think it is Sushia, but probably Darius.From what I got is that yesterday Destiny, Sushia and Seijen were in a call.   Somebody was trying to bait Darius in to getting mad.  Darius thought it would be funny to act like he actually was mad, and push both Destiny and Seijen to tell him (live) what was said.  After a while, Darius gets angry at Seijen.  Ragepope joins  Seijen lets Darius know they were talking about him.  Darius gets even angrier.We never learned what was actually said during the convo, so we have to speculate.

9344,Destiny,"I don't think Art is that hard to define. Here's my definition Art - An expression of the creative process (intentionally or unintentionally) viewed subjectively through the experience of one or more observers. I added the intention part because it was one of the main ideas discussed on the stream. However, I believe it's irrelevant and I believe all those involved last night would believe that as well, given the right example. So let's test this definition. My 10 year old nephew creates a painting and gives it to me. I view it as art, therefore it is. My nephew could also NOT view it as art and it still would be. (filtered through my subjective experience)The photocopier was also used as an example of something not creating art. But I can envision at least two cases in which it could be. If I photocopy my ass, as one is want to do, and sign it, and I view it as art, it is. Maybe others do as well, but that's not a requirement. If the photocopier is bleeding toner, maybe the photocopy it creates is much different and creates an artistic flair. It would depend on the subjective of those who viewed it. Let's do an unintentional example. We've all seen those waffles or pancakes that have Jesus or Mother Theresea on them. Many people view those as art. It's just happenstance that those features arise from the heat coils of a toaster. And while it would be a form of pareidolia, the fact that people go further and celebrate and subjectively view these pieces as art. Here's one more example that kind of blew my mind. I don't know if most people know this or not, but part of the popularity of the Mona Lisa was that it was stolen in the early 1900s. Retrieving it increased it's cultural and financial value. So you could \*actually\* argue that the heist to take the Mona Lisa was actually not only art itself, but almost like touching up the Mona Lisa and restoring it. Super weird, but interesting. I feel like a lot of the conversation revolved around the magnitude of social, cultural, and financial importance as it relates to what art is. But to be fair, that's not really important in classifying art, only I guess in classifying GOOD art. And even then, it's all subjective. I think consensus could maybe get us somewhere, but never even close to objectivity. While a picture painted by my nephew might have very little social, cultural, or financial significance to society. But it may have a lot of value to me personally. And as long as I view it as art, that's all the matters.",2509,453,0.9921,0.039,0.828,0.133

9360,Destiny,"Watching chat talk about AI art is giving me literal cancer. Title... All of chat soys out because they think they are logical and objective and artists are dumb and AI art is gigachad because it puts artists out of work or whatever, it's cringe as fuck. There's a few things to say here before responding to the arguments made on stream last night, of which I only caught some of. For what it's worth, I went to school for a fine art undergrad.1. Online freelance artists are ALMOST always fucking cringelords. Nobody really cares how long it takes to create a piece of art, drawing, sculpture, etc. People always tout this as something that makes their work special or unique, literally no potential customer cares, no layperson cares, it's purely self fellatio and genuinely makes all artists look like self entitled losers. 2. Illustration/graphic design is more akin to a craft than an art. This may be triggering to a lot of freelancers to hear but it's true. Someone that creates emotes, commission work for one off pieces, logos, animated intros for videos, etc. Are working in a more similar manner  to a craftsman creating furniture or a production glassmaker  for a client than they are to a fine artist making work for a series or gallery. To be clear, there is nothing wrong or bad about this but the distinction is pretty important in the context of this conversation.With that being said here are my thoughts on AI art as it currently stands.AI is another tool to be used to create amazing work, the same way a camera, or a computer, a Wacom tablet, or a drone with a video camera attached can be used to create amazing work, of course its all about the execution, this will evolve over time, this debate around the medium has happened with every single new emerging medium in art history, it's nothing new and will figure itself out over time, it will be extremely interesting to watch though.People comparing this to automation are right, it is like automation but the arguments I've heard to capture this as well as I think they could. The conversation shouldn't be about automation per se but around commoditization. The new technology makes custom art more accessible to the general public for sure, this is probably a good thing, as much as it triggers freelancers, having the public engage more with an artistic medium is good, having more people have access to tools to create art is good. **BUT** this is more along the lines of comparing Ikea furniture to furniture made by a master craftsman, yes everyone can now access it but there is a level of skill, talent, understanding of medium and concepts, history, and respect that AI can never put into a piece of art, I think completely writing off these human elements is childish and doesn't serve the conversation at all, these things are so deeply engrained in art and realistically go hand in hand, you almost can't separate them. AI art can never fully grasp conceptual work. This topic briefly came up last night and everyone was very understandably out of their element. Conceptual work is made for a very specific audience, an audience that is specifically seeking the deeper meaning behind a piece of series of work, they are looking for what is *not shown* more than what *is shown*. This doesn't mean it's better or worse than aesthetic art, it's just different, it's usually exploratory in nature, sometimes avant garde, and sometimes shocking for the sake of being shocking. This is personally my favorite kind of art, it requires deeper understanding of the artists intention, choices, and the history and context of a piece of work, this is fun for me. Performance art is a great example of something AI art could never recreate, the medium itself is something that changes with each show, it could script a piece I suppose but the actual art is the performance, the audience perception, reception, and reaction. This is why I say it moves more toward automation of a craft than of *art*.Contemporary art is very shaped by art history, similar to how popular music changes and borrows from music history over time, concepts, mediums, themes, and techniques in fine art do the same. AI can't currently assess these deeper understandings of fine art that humans can, and contextualize art in the way that we do. Sure you could prompt it to create a modern surrealist work and it would spit out something really interesting but there's no *why* there. The AI doesn't have an influence in the way a human artist does. Artists work is shaped by life struggles, was, their environment, other makers in and out of their field of work, their parents, current events, different forms of media, and a multitude of other factors. Artistic movements exist around specific historical events for the most part. DaDa around WW1, surrealism and the work of Freud, pop art and the hyper consumer culture of America in the 50s and 60s, etc. Some movements even develop from other movements like minimalism deriving from cubism and abstract expressionism. As it currently stands, I don't think AI can fully grasp these things, so the art it creates is much more surface level in these regards. At the end of the day, as much as it triggers the AI jerkers, this technology will make freelancers more money most likely, there will always be an audience that seeks out quality work made by human hands, look at any craft (pottery, glass making, portraiture, fiber work, furniture making) they will always be there, the artists themselves might have to change strategy over time and adapt but that's how it goes in any field. This audience will absolutely pay top dollar for this kind of work though, so I'm super interested as to how the market changes over time.The discussion last night about what is art is dumb, it's a debate that's been going on for centuries and honestly comes down to, whatever the fuck you perceive to be art, can probably be considered art. This discussion happens all the time around video games, movies, animated movies, pop music, etc.And it completely misses the point of emerging technology in an artistic concept, which is how can artists utilize these technologies to make even sicker shit. I know people that utilize 3D printing and VR to makes some really insanely sick work, this is very new technology and is already making huge ground in the fine art world, which is exciting for me as an art enjoyer. Realistically, AI will weed out middle of the road to bad artists which, is bad for them I guess, or who's to say, idk man. But hyper stylized artists or slightly more well known artists, ones with a following, even if a small one will not be phased out because the author is as important as the work. It's the same reason someone would buy a hand made les paul guitar instead of a much much much cheaper factory made one. Again, the audience might shift but there will still be demand. I could be wrong about a lot of AI stuff since I don't fully understand the technology to be completely honest, and haven't really researched it all that well, but I'm open to new information and good conversation regarding it, I just hate seeing the brainlets in chat soy out either way about anything art related when their understanding of most of it is from a 7th grade art history class they slept through.",7305,1274,0.9992,0.052,0.795,0.152

I'm sick of this topic so I'm gonna dump some thoughts 1) Art is made using an AI not by an AI Until the AI takes off and decides to make art without human input its just a tool. 2) Intentionality matters If I saw something that happened by accident or circumstance and found it emotional and artistic, It's not more than a flower is art.  The art falls onto me reflecting reacting and transforming it. 3) AI art will take artists jobsIf you're an artist who's job is selling work where your personality isn't part of the product Then yes. Your job Photoshopping a logo on Fuverr is probably gone. If you're an artist who selling their personality and life experience and using art as a medium. Then no it won't take your job. You might even benefit from using AI art for what you do4) Death of the artistArt is in the eye of the beholder. If someone looks at AI generated art and thinks its Art.... That's a you thing. Your interpretation of the work is in itself a commentary on what you value as art and how much you want to stand your ground on that topic and what arguments you make is you engaging in an artistic process. I'll finish this by giving an example close to my heart. I like music. I like a certain band and own their album. I'm not gonna buy a concert ticket to a show if they aren't there live. If I can't feel any of their personality. If an AI creates a piece of music. I'll listen to it. Probably won't buy it tho.

9370,Destiny,"What should D do to prepare for the CRP Roundtable? An analysis To begin with, Lazerpig is more of a memelord compared to other defense analysts like Perun, Military History Visualized and Ryan Macbeth. He is arguably more prepared for a debate. However, as he's area of expertise is focused around making videos, not debating, he may have some difficulty against opponents who does not care about facts. Like Haz during the debate with Adam Something. Therefore, D need to cover him when it comes to these dirty parts.However, bringing Lazerpig on has its own advantages. As a military analyst of sorts, he is capable of presenting better information than D probably can. Military analysis requires a lot of reading and expertise on certain subjects, which differs from most online debates where morality and presentation matters more. This is useful if Gonzalo tries to use spiked information, like the notorious Ursula Von Der Len casualty number. Moreover, compared to the larger experts, like Perun and Michael Kofman, Lazerpig is very skilled in memes and has a great influence on shitposting communities such as r/NonCredibleDefense, this increases the reward of winning such debate, as Gonzalo could potentially ridicule himself and end up being used against Russian propaganda machine.To be honest, I believe that D is the one who will carry most of the show, while Lazerpig acts like some sort of consulter who plays auxiliary roles. Gonzalo and the faction he represents is unlikely to engage in large scale talks about military facts, they probably know they are unlikely to win when it comes to knowledge, what they will do, is to use the debate as a tool to boost their fame. They are more likely to talk about the G-word in Donbass than how many HIMARS has been destroyed.The worst case scenario is when Gonzalo Lira had prepared extensively for this roundtable, probably under instruction from the notorious Internet Research Agency. In that case, the situation may be dire for D and Lazerpig. Russians have been using active measure since Soviet Union, often with great success. The tactics employed is mentioned below:The first phase of their action is to begin with a bombardment of false information. They are unlikely to talk about destroyed HIMARS, as this will just ridicule themselves. However, they are likely to say things that are plain outrageous. As a Chinese myself, I have plenty of examples, such as the claim that folks are harvesting organ out of dead Ukrainian soldiers. It's not about whether or not these claims are correct, but to make the other side feel unpleasant and angry, weakening them mentally.To counter such action, the key is to keep a record of all the lies the Russian sources have said. This is to provide a rapid response to whatever talking points they brought up. An analogy to the talking points CRP likes to use is that these talking points are like bullets manufactured from factories, single ones are not important, it's the overall volume of fire that matters. By targeting the factories, in this case the Russian media's credibility, the talking points are likely to be shut up for good.The second phase of their action is when D or Lazerpig quotes mainstream media. Historically saying, Soviet active measure have a tendency to amplify existing grievances. In this case, they will be aiming for the contrarians and populists, who tend to distrust the mainstream media due to anti-establishment belief or resentment. It's never about who's source is right, it's about causing as much trouble as possible. They will embrace a ""salad bar"" like method to portray all the mainstream media source as ""false"", ""controlled"", and ""sheepish"" by combining various form of conspiracy theory, anti-establishment anger, and existing grievances. This relies upon the fact that most populists are just contrarians who watched Matrix, and therefore can hardly be countered by logic.To deal with such situation, focus on breaking down their narrative and ridicule them by quoting Igor ""Strelkov"" Girkin (COD villain irl). Make them sound like tinfoil hat idiots, try to enrage them into making schizo rants instead of being redpilled hero.The third phase is when they try to portray it as a morality problem. They probably know Lazerpig cannot be countered easily even if they've brought Douglas MacGregor and Scott Ritter onboard. So instead they will spam ""Muh Donbass Genocide"". If that is true, they might also welcome some ""people"" onboard. Like Eva Bartlett and Patrick Lancaster for tearjerkers. If they are really prepared, maybe they are gonna show some pics of bombed Donetsk children. Gonzalo might do some dogwhistle for white nationalist, especially if Black Pigeon Speaks is onboard.In this case, D should just focus on fact and read history, make the audience feel that the likes of CRP are trying to manipulate them emotionally. Don't try to be a heartless bastard like me, who think that as the DNR lies occupies my countrymen's brain, we need to use 5 million rockets on them. Real thing, I really think that Yooks should kill 10% of LNR population to avenge holodomor and create a refugee crisis in Russia (basically what Russians do in Syria), and anyone who disagree with me is a na√Øve limpdick EU idiot who need to see the real world. I don't think I need to talk about crushing WW2 monument with German Vehicles just to piss off the Russians.The fourth phase is where the fun truly begins. This is the decisive point. ""What about our own border?"" It's never about facts, it's about sending a message to all the marginalized Americans, who are often nihilistic and don't give a fuck about logic. This also falls in line with the soviet practice of provoking troubles. And they can find an awful lot of folks who agree with them. Such actions may also be accompanied by a ton of gaslighting and insults aimed to coerce the other party to quit. The moderator is likely to be Gonzalo Lira himself.This is usually hard to counter for military experts like Perun due to their more upper middle class perspective. The key is the same with all the populists, don't let them enter the emotional mode, use fact and logic to unravel their ideological flaw, and prevent them from derailing it into US domestic policy.",6272,1049,-0.9946,0.132,0.764,0.103

I don't know as much as I wish about Somalia, but if he just wanted to stir some more shit to make the conversation spicier by just comparing the GDPs and skimming the wikipedia article about the African country there's a massive difference in economic growth, political security and democracy.  Paraphrasing what Destiny once said in a stream ""I can criticize and talk shit about my own country, but listening to a foreign asshole talk shit about it, makes me mad"", I felt the same shit. Comparing Mexico in economy, security, growth and even social issues to the US is a retarded comparison since not many first world countries can compete with the American nation, but I feel you guys get too comfortable talking shit, biased by horrible news about events in Mexico, and the shitty TV series where you Americans love to put that tacky yellow filter every time you show my country on the screen.  Mexico's political and economics subjects are complex as any developing nation in the Americas such as Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, we may aspire to a better political environment, better laws and economic reforms, and believe me, we are walking in the right direction with all the political turmoil, after all we tend to copy a lot our neighbors to the north. But all this shit about 'we need to bring some freedom', 'Le Mexican Cartel' that I read in chat tonight, made my blood boil a little bit, we are friendly nations, with the renewed USMCA we export a bunch of agriculture, minerals and work the factories to both the US and Canada for dirt cheap, so cars and electro domestics are affordable to you, we are pretty much your onshore India and China since we are also developing a shit load of your software too, and of course, at the same time you grow the economy in my country. We host vacations to a bunch of Americans and even a whole other bunch are migrating into our cities, sky rocketing rent and home prices making it practically impossible for a bunch of middle class Mexicans to afford. The issues that we have are our own issues, but the responsibility runs both ways, you boost our prices so much than most tourist places, the only Mexican people you'll see are workers, you sell guns to Mexican cartels, you buy and distribute our drugs to the rest of America, so the way that you act all high and mighty ""LULW Mexican Cartel's beheadings"" might fall a little bit in the *out of touch* side of things, compare it to the brits talking shit about school shootings.

Darius might be spergy but atleast when hes upset he owns his emotions. I respect that infinitely more than when weirdos insist they arent upset or angry at someone when they clearly are.

9429,Destiny,"The problem with AI art artists don't want to talk about If you've read through any of the AI art posts in the sub for the past month you might have already seen my argument already but I'll lay it out here again. **In this current age of the internet, it seems easy as fuck to max out the hedonistic treadmill just on human-made content alone.** I'm not any happier or more entertained now on a way bigger internet than I was 10 years ago. The human mind acclimates to things very easily and it seems like with the internet, entertainment feels maxed out. Most philosophers and psychologists seem to agree with this concept and the idea of working towards goals and greater meaning is a very common theme when it comes to helping unhappy people in modern times. It seems like for (most) people having something to work towards is necessary to be happy, you cant get by with entertainment alone.And this is the problem with AI art. The consumer will acclimate, the amazing ability to generate original artwork through prompts rapidly becomes as interesting as a google image search but the artists are *fucked*. There life meaning is gone. Visual arts is an incredibly easy thing for people to find meaning in. There are tons of unique niche styles, so even if your are not the best or just a hobbyist you can have your own style that no one does, and people will value your work. You also always have something greater to work towards because art has an extremely high skill ceiling and you can always get better. If AI can instantly produce better work than you, then whats the point?""But what about (insert a bunch of other things computers beat humans at, that people adapted too)?"" Art feels more susceptible to meaning loss than these other fields because we value works of art on their own merits. In chess for example even though computers are better, people want to watch two people battle it out, not AI so chess players can still find purpose in trying to be the best human player they can be. (Even still chess does feel a bit devalued when you can cheat by shoving a remote-controlled buttplug up your ass.)Most of the other reasons to push forward with automation don't really seem to hold up for AI art either. AI art doesn't improve human nutrition, make infrastructure better, or save lives. Perhaps there is some future utility, that training diffusion models on artwork will provide but I'm currently not seeing it. It just kinda feels like the biggest effect AI art is currently having, is making people freak out about AI and depressing artists.Honestly, beyond alignment, meaning loss is one of the biggest worrying things about AI. Some people will probably be fine, but if you get value from making things, or providing useful contributions, that's gonna be gone. In the future, *anything* that you create is going to be worthless on its own merits because AI will be able to do it better. People take the idea that if they work hard they can provide something of value for granted, and that probably will be coming to an end.I'm not saying living in a post-scarcity world where everything is taken care of by machines isn't good for a ton of reasons, but its worth noting the problems this is gonna cause even if we avoid dying by superintelligence.",3274,579,0.995,0.106,0.717,0.177

Well, this is probably adept trying to claim common law marriage in Texas because they where a couple for many years.**However** you would have to agree to it in writing mutually and have called each other spouses among other things. This seems highly unlikely on XQCs part.Based on the **legal** document, we can see that Adept was the one that filed it.So Adept filed a seemingly bogus ""divorce"" claim and used it to get a TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) and a Rule 11 agreement.A TRO in this case is about seizing assets/money, where no party is allowed to try and move money in any significant way. **NOT** about stalking and not being able to be a specific distance from each other.The Rule 11 agreement could have been what they where talking about. The Tesla car in this case. Where she is allowed to use it. A friend apparently was using it and XQC reset the password, witch caused said person to be stranded. Adept got mad and wanted revenge on XQC so she gets over to his house and shouts ""court case"" to deliberately give stream that information and mess with him.Adept seems to be even more toxic of a person then I thought based on all this. It's all about money/cars/assets and extracting as much of it from XQC as possible.I do not know why these things where agreed upon when she has no real claim of marriage.

9442,Destiny,"What is Art? The debate about AI art really does come down to that question. I'm not a debate-bro by any means, but if I were to define art, it would just be **a social contract that only requires at least one person (the artist) to produce and fulfill.** ***Art does not require an additional consumer beyond the artist.*** This is extremely important to understand. For example, if all humans disappear but the Mona Lisa still existed, because there are no more people alive to consume the painting, it does not change the intention when it was made.If the universe existed and there were no humans ever, assuming I'm speaking from the perspective of a secular worldview, then art would not exist yet until people exist. A theologian would say that art exists because God created beauty and the idea of creativity. So that would necessitate that people are an expression of the first artist, God, and endowed people with the ability to create art for others to enjoy, etc. The extension of the debate from tonight, AI Art and if it is in fact art, would IMO be fairly easy to answer. If AI is a tool that we create as humans (it is), just like any brush, that tool can be used to produce something. The artist has the right to dictate if their own work is art, even if everyone else denies that it is art, that would not matter. You really have to answer the question as if there was only 1 person in existence, because that's all that is required for art to exist (secular).",1477,270,0.9845,0.042,0.817,0.141

9446,Destiny,"The Work of Art in the Age of Digital Reproduction  This is my first effort post so bear with me.One of my favorite books of all time is Walter Benjamin‚Äôs *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction*. It‚Äôs a super short book and essentially it‚Äôs about how being able to replicate changes how we engage with it. He uses examples of us going from hieroglyphs to paintings to photography to film and sound. How we went from worshiping art privately at holy sites to worshiping them publicly in museums. About how when art is widely available it sometimes becomes worthless, an afterthought.Way back in the day, if you wanted a portrait of yourself, you had to go find a painter and sit down with them for 10 hours while they painted you. This changed with the camera. With that, all you had to do was find a photographer and sit down for 10 minutes, and even more, get a picture-perfect (for the time) representation of yourself.Artists were outraged, they said ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt art‚Äù, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no skill involved‚Äù there‚Äôs no love or thought in this‚Äù, ‚Äúthis is putting me out of business‚Äù. Sounds kind of familiar. It did put a lot of artists out of business, it did make the portrait an afterthought, it was a big event, you could always just get another one. Sounds pretty familiar doesn‚Äôt it? ‚ÄúJust enter another prompt!‚ÄùTake a more recent example, the invention of Hip-Hop, specifically the practice of sampling. A lot of artists said ‚Äúthis is not music, ‚Äùthis is just noise‚Äù ‚Äúthis is theft‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just stealing‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs lazy‚Äù, etc. Some of this is true, but what made Hip-Hop different was that as it progressed, it became normalized, it began to be recognized as a genre of its own. The artists who were getting sampled were now receiving royalties from licensing agreements. Society was happy, and a few generations later it‚Äôs the biggest genre on the planet. Hip-Hop didn‚Äôt put anyone out of business, it made business. And even in the cultural sense sparked a culture built on the foundation and appreciation (even indirectly) of older music. There have been plenty of times where I‚Äôve heard a song and went and looked up the sample and listened to that. It‚Äôs FAR from perfect with label disputes and this and that, contracts and stuff, but a system was built and we learned to live with it, love it, and hate it. And from that reform will come.AI art will definitely put people out of business, absolutely, but who ever said that evolution was peaceful? I don‚Äôt see why we feel entitled to safety in this regard. AI art will hurt people, it will make people appreciate art less, it will be abused and make people angry, it will damage our spirit, but most of all, it will bring us into the future. Art to me is simply a language communicating the world's most violent impulses, but it doesn‚Äôt matter what my definition is, same you for and yours. The definition changes every day. All that matters is that the work of art, is simply a work in progress, one that we have to respect, no matter how painful, for it will lead us to the next Hip-Hop, or the next cinematography, or the next photography, or the next museum, church, and hieroglyphic. That is the work of art in the age of digital reproduction, a loose thread connecting the past to the future.(My prescriptive opinion is that in a theoretical world, there would be some system where artists have to consent to have their art used in AI programs and receive some kind of credit, or monetary compensation.

So i made a thread a couple a days about about this, but i'm going to say some of my problems ai art and destiny's position:If Ai art gen is still going to need human artist's artworks to use in the future in it's database, then wouldn't that mean ai art isn't creating art in the same way as humans? Even worst, despite it's insurmountable amount of references in its database, what reason should ai, at this point, require further artworks from human artists? And yet i still see some people trying to add in more artworks in their ai generators.

The level of control a human artist has over their work isn't something an ai art can do, atleast currently. Anybody who denies this, is on some super tight copium. There's a reason why the concept artworks you get have pretty generic perspectives, or anime artworks with generic angles in some generic poses.And because ai art lack this level of control, the level of preference the user has over the generated images is also limited.

9464,Destiny,"On Art and AI **What is Art?**  Sorry for this cringe topic that makes every artist roll their eyes, I‚Äôll try to be brief and concise. The only thing that matters for defining something as ‚Äúart‚Äù is whether or not someone considers it art. This could be the creator or a viewer doesn‚Äôt matter. The definition of art‚Äôs parameters have been pushed over the years to broaden it to be literally anything. Crushing up some dust and calling it art is fine. In this way art requires a human element to define it as such. Duchamp is most famous for taking found objects and sticking them together, putting it in a gallery and calling it art. He had to fight for that in his time but today nobody in the world of art will bat an eye at calling that art. Literally anything can be art, it can also be literally nothing but a hypothetical idea, there are artists who only write about a hypothetical proposed art ‚Äúthing‚Äù and that idea itself is art. Art today is more about ideas than any object or image, it doesn‚Äôt have to physically exist or be beautiful or anything, it can be literally anything. All it needs is someone to call it art. Now if an AI deems something art whether we accept that is going to be really just based on how much weight we give the opinion of an AI. Honestly how much weight we'd give to the opinion of AI is a far more interesting discussion that I'm sure will shift as AI gets more advanced.**What's In a Word?**If the term ""art"" is so impossibly broad to include anything anyone considers art, isn't it too broad to be useful? Yeah, sort of yes sort of no. Thinking of it as a label is worthless, but it is useful in drawing a dialogue between art in the history of art and the interconnection between these things. All art exists in a dialogue with the history of art and calling something invokes that history. But if you are trying to use the word art to definitionally draw limits and boundaries you are missing the mark. It can only include and not exclude, the entire history of art is expansion. The only times the definition if art has shrunk has been like, in authoritarian governments where they try to relegate art to favorable propaganda and destroy all else. This is the same as when you see all those right wing morons try to define art as only including classical art.**Are AI Images Art?**Yes. But does it matter? No. Whether or not something is art is a boring question that doesn‚Äôt matter much, so why do people keep asking and talking about it? I think the reason is because people attach value to the notion of ‚Äúart‚Äù, but this is a wrong way to think about it. Literal trash can be art, value has nothing to do with art, effort has nothing to do with art, money has nothing to do with art, but people erroneously use it in these ways all the time. What they really are trying to say is ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt good art‚Äù because it was made by AI, this position is basically the same as when photography entered the scene and people did not consider that art because it‚Äôs just snapping a photo like a copier, but today we absolutely consider photography art and AI art will be no different.**Two Kinds of Art**Art is basically split into two separate but intertwined realms, generally today we would refer to them as ‚Äúcommercial art‚Äù and ‚Äúfine art‚Äù but it all falls under the huge amorphous umbrella of art. Originally art primarily served very practical function, to illustrate a thing. Most all artists existed to make portraits of rich patrons or record history and myths and whatnot. How good an artist was considered was almost entirely determined by how well they could recreate reality like a copier. Eventually technology advanced and photography entered the scene and art had a crisis of identity because the camera could do everything artists did but better and faster. So art reinvented itself to be more about ideas than illustration and they created the whole art scene which was and is considered more prominent than mere illustration because after all, mere illustration is child's play by this point, anyone can do it in seconds. Funny enough after the fine art scene was created photographers were the ones left out in the cold and they had to fight and claw their ways back into being considered art. The kind of artists being replaced by AI art are basically in this category now, they are being replaced by AI like many illustrative artists were replaced by the camera. And honestly, I don‚Äôt say this to be mean, but in many ways these digital artists have more in common with cog makers in a factory than the fine artists making art in galleries and museums today. Sorry but your effort and skill mean nothing to art today and replacing it with AI is inevitable. In fine art effort and skill have been considered obsolete for a long time now, there are plenty of artists who don‚Äôt ever touch any of their work they just write up schematics and tell a crew to assemble it and nobody thinks twice about it. I know this makes people upset because they want to believe that effort has value for effort‚Äôs sake but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a damn thing.",5097,925,0.9962,0.057,0.821,0.121

Artists already put a lot of stock in the fact they are an artist when they conceive of themselves. Aside from that I would personally say the creation of art grants the artist a sense of deeper fulfillment that is rare to find in the day to day human experience. These coupled with the fact that many artists monetize their art as a means to make money makes it even more offensive. The whole philosophical argument is a cope by both sides, the fulfillment and monetary consequence is the only thing that matters. That‚Äôs all.",715,132,-0.8573,0.099,0.864,0.037

9490,Destiny,"When does personal choice become trafficking? This is obviously in regard to the conversation around Andrew Tate. I've seen numerous videos and clips of Destiny promulgating the the behaviors Andrew Tate engaged in ""**are**"" sex trafficking and that ""**he is**"" a sex trafficker. But frankly this perspective seems to remove a lot of the nuance that Destiny usually engages these topics with, especially when it comes to topics of sex and consent. My main contention here is that the essential factor that's up for debate is to what degree elements of force were used. If Tate was truthful about the business proposition (with regards to what the work was) and the girls had the freedom to come and go as they please (plus contact family, etc), and there was no violence involved in order to keep the women there - where exactly is the human trafficking element here? Destiny continually likes to bring up that Tate would set up meeting with women and would bring another woman along to help convince the ""prospective employees"" of the opportunity.,,but that's standard business practices as far as im concerned. There's nothing **inherently** wrong with that. From my understanding:1. The girls were fully aware and consented to what Tate was proposing with regards to cam shows 2. The girls were fully aware and consented that they would be moving to a different country to live in his home to preform this work3. The girls had bodily autonomy with regards to when they would work and if they wanted to leave4. The girls were able to contact family and friends at any point5. The girls were paid well (even though he took a larger %)If this would have been any other buisness than cam shows, i don't think people would be so quick to use this label i.e if this would have been a ""female tiktok content house"" i don't think people would be suggesting that he was engaging in human trafficking of any sort **given** elements of force and violence weren't used to **force** these women to engage in various activities. As another example - i would be willing to be that Destiny has used Melina (or any of the other girls he's had sexual relations with) to ""convince"" women engage in sex acts. We wouldn't suggest that he was engaging in sex trafficking even though he would be employing largely the same tactics that Tate used.

9501,Destiny,"A hypothetical showcasing the bad faith of Destiny in regards to the proclaimed evaluation of his subjectivity Destiny specifically stated that what he values in humans is the necessary capacity for semantic understanding that defines the human experiences as is.There is a simple hypothetical I want to pose, which is not necessarily non-factual.Let us say that in the next decade we establish in the most rigorous scientific way that whatever structure or capacity Destiny is referring to right now is not actually present in new borns. The new born is sentient, but the capacity for that type of semantic, supposed necessity for human experience, does not actually occur until 8 months after the child was born, on average, around the time when infants develop the ability to perceive object permanence.Let us put Destiny into a similar hypothetical world, in which a device exists that is capable of establishing truth with absolute reliability. The absolute reliability of the device is known and epistemically justified by Destiny.Before Destiny lies in new born infant. He asks the device whether or not the infant has the necessary capacity for semantic understanding that Destiny deems as the fundamental differentiator between animal and human, and therefore what he truly values. The device tells him that the infant lacks said capacity, and that the brain will continue to develope until structures emerge which give rise to that capacity.At that point, Destiny should have no ethical qualm with eradicating the infant, if his description of his values was honest and accurate. If Destiny truly values the proposed capacity, then lacking that capacity is the determining factor of care. If his moral concern for the being still remains, his proposed value is a lie.If at that point he would attempt to find another thing that he claims he actually values, it means that his entire philosophical system is a bad faith attempt at avoiding certain moral conclusions. He is attempting to find a differentiating factor, not because he genuinely cares about that factor, but because he wants to uphold a certain moral conclusion.His values are not actually his values, they are a stand in philosophical facade to protect his inconsistency. And that inconsistency is that he does not care about logical consistency in moral values, he cares about perceived logical consistency. He does not attempt to genuinely discover and describe his values, and then find a way to resolve the necessary inconsistencies (like for one being against the arbitrary discrimination of individuals, while at the same time arbitrarily discriminating against individuals). He instead attempts to veil his internal moral contradictions by creating a system which appears consistent, but which proposed values he does not actually hold.",2817,447,0.9979,0.041,0.759,0.2

9517,Destiny,"Destiny has bad takes on steroids Credentials: been using steroids to some extent for 7+ years. Competed in powerlifting, member of university powerlifting club, strength training enthusiast for over a decade. I haven't caught many livestreams lately but heard Destiny go on a rant about steroids after touching the topic of Mizkif on a highlights video. I started using testosterone at 25 after extensive research and exprience in the weight room. I chose to do so because I paid for a  test which was the gold standard for independent testing outside of a doctor's referal for hormones on r/steroids back in 2015ish. I was riiiight on the brink of low T but when I showed my PCP this information they essentially said ""you're in the reference range, you're 25, you don't need to do anything about it"". I decided to go on a cycle and my life changed for the better ever since then. My confidence and sex drive increased, no more random episodes of ED, obviously gains at the gym exploded (they were stagnating while natural but nothing that was causing me any grief). Basically the things that I experienced going on exogenous hormones were cures to problems I didn't realize I had. There are numerous downsides to using hormones and I would never recommend it to anyone unless they are well-researched and realize that fucking with hormones can cause permanent effects on fertility, balding, and many other things. I would ABSOLUTELY never recommend anyone touch any hormones before the age of 25 and before strength training and eating properly for 5+ years as well. **All that being said, Destiny's main take that I have issue with is ""roids will never make you fat, roids are a cheat code"".** That is simply not true. There are many people at your local gym who are using hormones who look like shit and you would never know it, I promise you. Go take a look at r/steroids, I have no idea what the community is like these days but 7 years ago there were plenty of mid-20s guys who looked totally normal that were taking enormous amounts of gear. From personal experience, at 27-28 I remember running a cycle of 500mg Test-E/500mg Tren-E/500mg Mast-E per week for 12 weeks, trained extremely well, but ate like a disgusting animal (5000kcal+ per day, fast food all the time, etc). I was reckleslly running a cycle like this because I had lost a ton of weight and was the leanest I'd ever been (215lb @ 6'3""). I ballooned up to 265lb over 12 weeks but I looked like a bloated sack of shit, even with these super dry compounds at pretty crazy doses in my opinion for a non-pro. Yeah I had veins and was huge and had cannonball delts, but to the average person I just had a dadbod with some muscle. Steroids are not a cheat code, if you don't know what you're doing and you aren't disciplined you will still look like flabby fucking shit. Now I just run TRT dose of testosterone and probably will forever because I had low T at 25 and feel much better with negiligible sides doing this.",2987,532,0.6787,0.11,0.771,0.12

9520,Destiny,"Taftaj needs to touch grass and stop internalized transphobia bait posting online. This is a post specifically for Taftaj from my experiences. I just see her acting in so many ways so many trans women i've tried to support have and it's really frustrating to see it broadcast to a wider audience when it's so cancerous to be flinging your own trans issues so wildly at what I assume is a decent trans audience of hers.As a passing trans woman who has been living like this for well over a decade. Taftaj's self hate posting and coy ""oh this is what I really mean"" is really frustrating. What she posts on twitter is nowhere near what she argued on stream and it just comes off as spreading her own unhappiness on her platform to as many people as possible. Nothing she's saying is perse wrong, but the obvious thing is that she can only see it in a doomer negative view rather than a normal neutral view. Whoever got the idea in her head that transition is the nearly only way or should be the main way to fix trans people's mental health and if it doesn't succeed at that it's therefore a failure is just wrong. I know that it's a common view touted even in the medical field but it's just not founded in anything, as she herself pointed out. It's fundamental for trans people to seek regular therapy and help to move through tangentially related mental health issues that often crop up from simply living the trans experience pre or post transition. Her implication that if she had waited until she was an adult to transition she wouldn't have been so terminally online is just not realistic for the vast majority of the trans community. Most of the trans dysphoria comes pre transition and whether it alleviates or not post transition, not taking it on is not going to keep a pretrans person from developing many of our non-trans mental health issues which come about from literally having this gender issue stuck in your head and coping with how it relates to society.She might imagine herself becoming a regular cis male then later in life switching to how she is now and skipping years of suffering online as a trans person but it's just not realistic. You're going to be tackling that mental health issue from the first day it starts taking over your mind until you either die or find peace with it. Most pre-trans and post-trans people live pretty similar lives to before if they don't take massive steps to change their life outside of simply transitioning. Simply put, it's as easy to live as a homebound online loser pre-transition as post and nothing trans related will fix that on its own.But most importantly it seems like she has a goal to be a cis woman. Which is fine and typical for most trans women. Now we can't ever literally become 100% cis, we all know that. The real question is if you can accept being 99.999% cis in all situations with the last part being your history. And if you can reach that 99.999% cis passing and accept that then the real healing can start where you can lower that percentage to 90% cis or lower as you become better at coping with the inherent realities of sex and gender and society. The reason so many non-passing trans people are seething at her is that they perceive her already being at 99% cis woman, where as many can not ever achieve over 50%. Yet many still find peace with themselves regardless of how much they pass as cis woman and how close they actually are to them. And as someone who has experienced that seething, it does suck and it does erase our lived experiences and struggles. Obviously ""you pass so be happy"" isn't going to work. But there are methods that can work to bring your life into the norm and reduce your suffering. Hundreds in fact, and most of the literature says they all work pretty much equally. It's called therapy and various therapeutic techniques. Are they a sure fire? No. For therapy to work you need to use it as a tool to chisel away at your own problem. Nobody and no pill and nothing can drag you over the finish line. Enough seething: Here's my recommendation to all trans people that are stuck in gender dysphoria hell from my experiences with so many trans women and myself, but most importantly to taftaj and her predicament. 1. Transition so at least you feel like you can go out as a woman - step 1 secured by taftaj2. Go to both trans therapy (you gotta anyways) and any other type of therapy of your choice. I personally like CBT but afaik all the licensed ones work more or less. - I think she's here, I hope.3. Start tackling your life problems like a cis person would. Take on a veil of ignorance on trans aspects from as many of your life problems as possible and tackle those first and foremost the way your therapeutic choice encourages you to do as if they were dealing with any other cis person. 4. Stop delving into trans theory. Over self inspection is not something ANYBODY can do lightly and requires extreme levels of self esteem and self objectivity to start avoiding self imposed biases that will just trap you further. You are not Descartes, stop staring into the abyss. 5. For mostly passing trans people like taftaj, go outside and build up your positive gender euphoria experiences. If you set yourself up to have mostly bad experiences they will weigh in your mind hardest. It is not cheating or fooling yourself to go out of your way to positively reinforce your happiness in your life, it's what most happy people do inherently. ***GET THE FUCK OFF THE INTERNET AND STOP WATCHING CONTENT LIKE MATT WALSH THAT YOU KNOW IS JUST GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE SHIT NO MATTER HOW ""GOOD"" HIS POINTS MIGHT BE TO YOU. YOU HAVE TO BE HAPPY BEFORE YOU CAN BE CORRECT.*** For taftaj specifically: People are not delusional when they tell you pass mostly as a cis woman. But I know you don't always feel this and that's 100% valid. But it's time to start checking your internal thoughts with reality. When I was younger I went stealth 100%. Did I always pass 99.99%? No way. Did it matter? Not when I was passing nearly all the time and reinforcing others positive perceptions of me in my mind. The euphoria way overwhelmed the dysphoria over time. How did I get to this point? By specifically putting myself out there as a cis woman over and over to build up that belief. The baby trans starts with r/passing and omegle. The fully realized trans makes friends in stealth, goes on tinder in stealth (but doesn't meet people in dangerous situations), lives as stealth. And you see how long you can go as a full cis woman. You and I are at the point where if you move cities and nobody knows who you are likely nobody will find out. Each of these interactions should reinforce in you that you are a cis woman to other people. Getting she/her isn't usually enough, but you know what really reinforces that you're passing? Having your friends say transphobic shit around you or talk about other trans people. Once it becomes obvious it's not even in their mind you might be trans it just takes a lot of mental gymnastics to not convince yourself. This is all about how to pass and how to convince yourself you pass. But here's the thing. Once you do convince yourself you pass and that dysphoria alleviates you will realize how little it changes in your life. Living as a trans woman without having transphobia get in your way, internal or external is really similar to living as a cis woman. Once you see that concept in action it makes living as a 100% passing cis feel less important, at least it did for me, because there was no actual change in my life. I was living the benefits of being 100% passing at 75% passing more or less. I don't think I can get you to this point specifically but if you can get to the point where you don't feel constant dysphoria over the passing question that should be good enough. I'll say that at this point in my life i do not live stealth and I stopped trying to pass. Mostly I don't do the voice stuff anymore because the benefits it gives me isn't worth the work to me. That's just personal. Now I never pass on the phone or just through voice. But because I know I can if I want to and have come to peace with the fact my life is almost always that of a cis woman so why would I put in that extra work for the last percentage? That's just my experience. After a while I got very disillusioned with how living as stealth keeps me from being able to voice my beliefs on trans issues and the inherent lying about my past. But those issues need not be a big deal. JUst not quite my tempo. I hope the last parts where our goals and experiences diverge doesn't make you uninterested in the rest of what I have to say because from my experience those key steps are the major difference between happy trans people I know and depressed trans people I know. I know you have the tools you need to live a happy life. But nobody can do it but yourself. While you are suffering try not to constantly broadcast it as nothing spreads suffering like company. Especially un-nuanced internet company. I hope all the best for you, please stop shitting up DGG and the trans community with your shitty hot takes you have a million layers of nuance hidden only in your own mind. /huge trans schizo post",9232,1694,0.9567,0.105,0.786,0.108

9536,Destiny,"3 years ago I heard Destiny use the phrase, ""that X is doing a lot of legwork"" and I really liked that saying. But then like a week after, as he tried to recall the phrase, he landed on ""that X is doing a lot of heavy lifting"" and stuck with it since. I've been mad since I remember the first instance of the revision happening. It was a discussion that Steven was having with someone. The discussion had *something* to do with Rajj (he had already long become Austin at this point) but he wasnt the main focus. Destiny wheeled out the phrase but having only recently learned it, paused and forgot the key word. Thus ""legwork"" became ""heavy lifting""At that moment I immediately noticed the flub but I didnt pay it much mind. I figured he would correct himself or someone would do it for me. It's been 3 years and it's become one of his most often used phrases.Now here's the rub. I actually have no fucking idea if I imagined all that first bit. Like maybe it was ""heavy lifting"" all along and I just imagined (???) Destiny using ""legwork"" that first time. Nobody else seems to fucking care but it genuinely bothers me every time I hear it. I think ""legwork"" is superior as it conveys the same meaning as ""heavy lifting"" only (A) without being so on the nose that it defeats its own purpose as an idiom while (B) being a far more dynamic descriptor, which can even hint at a sly willfulness on the part of the addressee. Which just so often happens to be the case when the phrase is evoked. Even if nobody ever said ""legwork"" and I just entirely made up this backstory to annoy myself for the last 3 years, I will die on the hill that ""legwork"" is the superior variation of the phrase.",1685,317,0.6868,0.072,0.841,0.087

9558,Destiny,Chudlogic is Wrong about the Kai situation [Effort post] I just watched the YouTube video of Destiny discussing this with Chudlogic. I hate when Destiny has a neutral stance on something or doesn‚Äôt really care. Because he concedes a lot of ground he doesn‚Äôt need to. I think the quickest way to debunk chuds arguments is to look at the time stamps in the text messages. People like Chud are trying to make it seem like huge amounts of time passed. The rape happened early January 1st  so prob anywhere from 2 AM to 5 AM. She admits she didn‚Äôt go to the hospital until the next day which she sent the first text at the hospital at 4:58 AM Monday. So almost 24 hours since it happened. Because per the lil boom interview and her statements made on her Twitter thread she was crying so much that she didn‚Äôt do it right after. \Timeline\)So these next 24 hours are important. Between 4:58 AM Monday and 4:58 AM Tuesday we know both the rape kit and the police report were submitted. Because according to both of them the police was contacted within 24 hours. So the time Kai was being ‚Äúdismissive‚Äù was between 9:03 AM Monday and 4:58 AM Tuesday.  Because she confirmed and he confirmed that Kai was in talks with the police. So In less than 24 hours of her coming forward to the proper authorities Kai also was cooperating with the same authorities. Now I posted the link to the text. We can break down from the time Kai woke up at 9:03 AM until he stopped responding to her. Her messages after Kai woke up said she was getting a rape kit done and not to let the rapist know. Now here is something you have judge with your own morality. Kai has known this girl for a total of 2 days at this point. And has known the alleged rapist for 5+ years. He ends up confronting the alleged Rapist. I think it‚Äôs a normal human response to confront your friends first. At 2:29 PM Monday she sent a full picture of the alleged rapist and Kai responds ‚Äúits himmmmm?‚Äù now this can be interpreted two ways. He didn‚Äôt know him or he‚Äôs shocked that it‚Äôs a person he knows. I‚Äôm leaning on the he‚Äôs shocked. Kai doesn‚Äôt respond right away and then says he‚Äôs currently in a meeting figuring things out. This meeting is probably one with his legal team. Which is confirmed to be real by Jovi on the lil boom interview \Lil Boom Interview\) and on her Instagram story later. Jovi admits to talking to a woman from his legal team and her words are that this woman really helped and listened to her. So him not responding right away at this point is because he is in a meeting. More text go by and Kai says the guy he sent upstairs to check on her and that guy are two different people. Then we get to Chuds biggest piece of evidence that Kai is openly lying to her \Chud evidence\). One interpretation is Kai is lying the other is he is still talking to his legal team and because it‚Äôs his friend they are trying to make sure that it‚Äôs him. Now is this being dismissive 100% but again this up to your moral judgement as I said. He is trying to confront his friend first. No where does Kai say explicitly he didn‚Äôt know the individual. Here the time gets wonky because there are no timestamps but we know again that it‚Äôs a 24 hour window so it‚Äôs between 2:30 PM Monday to 4:58 AM Tuesday. They get into a heated exchange over text where she accuses Kai of setting her up. He gets super defensive and is telling her he is getting all the info. Any reasonable person would get defensive. Here is why Kai had to make a live stream was because he was getting accused of being involved. You can decide for yourself whether it was a good or bad live stream. Eventually Kai stops responding I‚Äôm assuming his legal team told him to stop the same legal team confirmed to be true. So this would line up with both their statements as to why he stopped responding. They both confirmed that she received a paragraph from the legal team that he would no longer be responding. So this debunks that Kai got that order during the time of this text thread. So Kai was doing this on his own. Timeline speed run. Kai‚Äôs legal team did not respond to her all of Tuesday. At some point on Wednesday they gave her and I‚Äôm assuming the police the name of the alleged rapist. Thursday she made the story public. Friday it blew up and Kai did his live stream.From this timeline I have laid out Kai cooperated with police within 24 hours of her going to the hospital. And gave the name of the alleged rapist within 24-36 hours of him knowing who it was. So in 3 days Kai has done everything a 3rd party is legally able to do. Now you can say morally he could‚Äôve given the name up when he saw the first picture but he was being a normal human. No one makes the correct logical and moral decision 100% of the the time. The worse thing he did was not be super sympathetic and not be the best communicator. But it‚Äôs the first time he has been a situation like this. I hope Jovi gets her Justice and the guy who did it gets thrown under the jail.  Kai has gone above and beyond what any of these other streamers have done.,5060,961,-0.984,0.094,0.838,0.068

Growing up me my brother and sister all had chores in the kitchen but me and my brother had extra chores for being guys. Such as taking out the trash and doing yard work. Now you might think ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the big deal?‚Äù Well that‚Äôs my point what‚Äôs the big deal for a woman to know how to take out the trash or push a lawn mower. The thing is I know there are women who can do these things and more. I knew of girls who grew up on farms and handled horses. On the other end you got people treating their daughters and sons as if they need separate tasks in the house. One thing I especially noticed taking out the trash. Our family would over stuff it then tell us it‚Äôs full. Me and my brother were supposed to be able to handle it because we are guys. The point is if people don‚Äôt do a task you can take things for granted and become entitled.

We'd also use Heroforge to make virtual minis for both the enemies and the party members. (Ive already accumulated over a 100 Minis from heroforge).2) The Campaign would run on DnD 5e with some homebrew rules. (if yall can co-ordinate int he discord and come up with a good list of potential homebrew rules, ill review em potentially incorporate some.)3) I'd like to keep it to a midsized party (3-4 players) as cancellations can become frequent and throw off pacing of campaign. Also it would be run every other week (twice a month) for about 3 hours.4) The world would be a homebrew  depending on the kind of campaign the players wanna play, their may be easter eggs involving the DGG universe slotted in (in a non-corny way). POLITICAL intrigue maybe?5) I've ran two campaigns before and my veteran DnD players loved it. Do I feel qualified?

There are a few people who saw the term slave and started immediately jumping to comments like ""you earn so much, you aren't a slave"". Please, and thankyou. And for some reason my comments are not visible, so i can't address those headline readers.**If you're a software engineer or work in finance or work in a call center, or work in any tech related field,*1. *There's a high chance that you work more than 10 hours a day leaving no time for you to spend time with your friends or family, or do something for yourself.*2. *We keep doing this same thing till the day we retire which is 30 or 40 years from our mid 20s.*3. *We aren't allowed to take breaks for a few months from our jobs, because then our HRs would assume that we're no good for working for them.**All of these things fall under the definition of being a slave. Isn't it? What's the definition of a slave? Work hard for someone with little lack of freedom. Nobody thinks about calling this slavery because we've been programmed to belive that a slave is usually a black African guy who's working for their master day night and getting below min wage. But just because we get paid more, doesn't mean you aren't any different.**If you're living in a metro, forget about buying a house unless you take a hefty loan and keep paying for the rest of your life. Things have become so expensive that you look around yourself , barely any millennial has their peace of mind unless you earn really really good or have generational wealth. The point of a job was so that it would provide us security, a house and a family to afford. It's almost impossible to provide for a family of four in a metro unless both the partners work which inevidently creates problems since they don't get enough time to spend with each other. This is much more prevalent in Japan, but it's catching up in India too.**Depression is so common amongst millennials and it's so atrociously dismissed by saying ""hit the gym"", ""make some friends"". Sure, those things help but we've bigger problems with our system and we're too divided to solve it.**Why are we letting these things happen? Why are workers union so inactive in our country?

I might be crazy but I even remember some sort of retard speaking about whether 4 men can lock up 75 women or not. Anyway.Today I was browsing an article which referenced the original arrest of the Tate brothers and the other two people who were arrested were named as Luana Radu and Georgiana Naghel. two women who look like models, if the pictures are to be believed.  In any case they are women, not men. If there were armed men (other than Andrew and Tristan Tate) guarding and locking up these women why are they not charged? Why are they not arrested? If a girl comes out and you show her a pistol and say ""go back inside"" that's some sort of crime by itself, either kidnapping, or something. So that would be an instant arrest, right?Where are the other men in the story, and if there are none, how did this rumor even start? Are we just waiting them for to be revealed but their involvement is confirmed?There must have been an original source to the ""armed men keeping them locked up"". Does anyone know what was that or where is any source that describes the subsequent arrest or public naming of the other men who were part of the criminal gang keeping this many women locked up?",1343,248,-0.98,0.128,0.831,0.04

But then what if someone asks ""So what age does semantic understanding develop because that seems to conflict with your abortion take""? Just say ""I am not sure when but it would at least need concussions to form so at a minimum their which kind of coincides with the abortion take"".Doing this you have now pushed off the responsibility for you to prove that humans have have semantic understanding at x years old away and put the responsibility on them to prove that they don't and that animals do.They might ask you the hypothetical ""what if 20% of people are born without this capacity and they grew up to be adults would you be okay as viewing them as animals because they are born without that capacity?"" And you would just say yes.# Making arguments against veganismIt is always a joke about how insane destiny beliefs are mostly because they are inconsistent meat eaters or vegans that talk about it e.g. thinking that killing, torturing, and rapping animals is fine. Now this is just what you have to believe to be a consistent meat eater but something that Destiny has only really ever done once was show just how insane you would have to be against animals to be a true vegan.If you really wanted to be consistent as a vegan you would have to believe that killing all carnivores is something that ought be done as their existence is predicated on killing other sentient beings so cull all cats(they cant be vegan), lions, foxes, sharks, dolphins, e.c.t. although will have to add an addendum that is is okay to let carnivores eat each other but ones that eat herbivores have to go. So the only argument that a vegan can really make here is that these animals have the less agency than a 4 year old and if a 4 year old killed people we wouldn't sentence the 4 year old to death we would confine them. That is true but what I would say is that we don't have to resources to confine every single animal like we do with the rare case of a 4 year old and in that case not stopping them is basically allowing billions of meat eater serial killers to kill and hurt herbivores. Also in the case of a 4 year old if we literally couldn't contain that 4 year old we would kill em.The inconsistency here that most vegans have may not be to the level that meat eaters have but that doesn't excuse inconsistency and both most meat eaters and vegans are inconsistent so don't make fun of meat eaters too much.",2541,465,-0.9973,0.165,0.79,0.045

9674,Destiny,"Any advice on a quick dive into understanding Rand‚Äôs Objectivism? Upon growing up a bit, I realized that being a libertarian was just an emotional ego statement. I couldn‚Äôt even finish Atlas Shrugged. It's prob one of the boringest books I've ever picked up. Well composed enough but the content was mind numbing. I've largely written off this school of thought as a feisty adolescent wet dream. ""I do what I want.""Though, there are elements of righteousness, in practice we can see there's no place that proves by example it's value and the maximal path that it leads one to of ""anarchy"" is just as max ally absurd and almost a pathetic position to hold in this day and age. For more than a number of reasons But I would like to understand the full extent of the arguments and be able to steal man the school of thought myself, since woefully, most normal people can't even hold a candle in debate on these topics. That being said, I've never in person or threw communication of ideas threw any other medium, found anyone doing much service to the ideas. So typically that's not a red herring. One only needs to watch a libertarian party debate conference / primary to examine the mindlessness of its ideas being flaunted in just words not even practice.Now, so I don't offend people with this proclamation as well... I'm a very mixed hybrid type person. I like our model now but seek to erode the corruptive perverse incentives byhaving a melting pot of ideas to push back from all angles. Keeping any one side in check by thevoice and existence of the polarity. There are some libertarians principles and critiques of the modern world that are spot on (which 'happen' to be correct - often for different reasons - like math the work must be shown) and I'm glad we have people tuned from all ranges of belief to illustratethese pit falls. That being said, of course the current social maelstrom is far beyond driven in more toxic paths with ill intended course (largely because of perverse incentives). We can‚Äôt afford to lose ourselves in a paradox of intolerance and must educate on the basic precursors (the whys not just the how) for the system to be the fittest of all, despite its many short comings and failures. People tend to be the problem not the systems. As many different systems work for many different specific reasons, more or less. And to be even more clear. I sort of see this maxim, as a starting point to work back from in a way; as a place to derive ideal but then to be rationale and realist with trade offs /cost and benefits. Agian a range of models: (what I call) soft deontology that‚Äôs subjectively judicious and relative, that‚Äôs originally guided by utilitarianism and virtue ethics with a smearing over stroke of pragmatism and prudence. (In brief).The suggestion I heard recently was I should have done the ""Fountain Head"" first. I worry that if it‚Äôs anywhere near the dribble that Atlas Shrugged was, that I won‚Äôt manage to get even 1/2 way threw. Any YouTube links, podcast, lectures (I'm more of an audio learning person) or conceptual ways to consider itwould he greatly appreciated. ‚úåüèº",3121,549,0.7127,0.083,0.815,0.102

9712,Destiny,"Destiny on Ethan Klein, some pushback on Andrew Tate Preface this with I do watch Ethan, mainly for comedy, don‚Äôt watch his political shows much. I agree with a lot of previous criticisms destiny has had on Ethan also.Destiny says Ethan will ALWAYS be in the wrong for calling Andrew tate a sex trafficker because he did it with no evidence. This isn‚Äôt entirely true, Ethan was one of the first people to look at that website which he clearly states himself doing almost the exact definition of human trafficking, with that and the combination of the circumstances of his first arrest, I think it‚Äôs pretty fair to call someone a human trafficker. Why? We call these crypto guys scammers all day, not because they have been charged with fraud or something, but because of what they have said and done.Other than Andrew tate getting arrested for human trafficking, what major evidence has come out? That Bruce rivers video was made with all stuff previously public, the only reason destiny believes the charges heavily now is because he has seen what Andrew has said. Ethan has been picking the Andrew tate bone for content since may,  h3 subreddit was filled with all the clips we are seeing now.In conclusion if you want to say he is sort of wrong for jumping the gun, sure, but saying he will always be wrong like he said that out of no evidence whatsoever isn‚Äôt true (not that destiny said that but I thought it was insinuated).Also if you didn‚Äôt know Andrew tate sent Ethan a cease and desist for defamation in august or September.",1534,271,-0.8757,0.108,0.814,0.078

I think it could be scary tho. It would make a lot of people scared of getting sued in case DNA records showed their family owned slaves and that success of owning slaves still impacted their assets to modern day. I will say I wonder how that compares to any argument for the US to compensate black people over laws that prevented many from prospering or whether the US should pay reparations for such an event. We have given compensation to other minorities affected the US. Only thing I can see being argued for the slavery thing is that it wasn't necessarily the US.

It upsets me because I‚Äôm on the right.  And I see so many fall for the same propaganda they accuse the left of.  I think there is a real good argument to be made from the right on things like population growth.  Or how misinformation is treated by the mainstream media when it comes to right vs left.  Or censorship.  But instead my side rejects everything they hear from mainstream media because they do get things wrong and pundits are agenda driven, and latch on to everything the extreme opposite is saying without any of the cynicism they give to mainstream.  We need more people like Destiny on rumble.  But more importantly we need more reasonable right wingers who aren‚Äôt big names like Shapiro.

How can he have so much experience with the human brain but just fail to see he's blind towards the plights of probably the most disadvantaged groups of human society, just because he's banned from twitter or he's surrounded by millions of apeshit leftists?It's seems crazy to me, like imagine your mom having a pain in her back and when she tells you, what you care most about is how GENDER EQUALITY HAS GONE TOO FAR.

9755,Destiny,"Pillows Do Not Belong On Couches I'm so fucking tired of going over to someones house and seeing that every formerly-usable seat is just covered in throw pillows. It makes me irrationally angry, and I want to spread my hatred amongst the masses so this interior design trend can off itself.Firstly, the pillows are never comfortable in their own right. You'd never use a throw pillow as a sleeping pillow. They're always either too thick, too thin and flimsy, have a rough material, or have those shitty little decorative bits that jab into you when you lean on them. They're purely hedonistic display pieces.And when you place them on the couch or loveseat, it makes less room to sit down. You can almost never lean back comfortably in a couch covered in throw pillows. Either your ass is too unstable if you're sitting on them, or they push up against your back if they're behind you. It's never good.So to sit down, you have to move them. But to where? Another chair? But that chair, invariably, is also covered in pillows. So now you can either pile them up or throw them on the floor, neither of which are aesthetically pleasing.Now, if there is someone with lower back issues that needs pillows to sit down with, for example, I think it's good to have a few COMFY SOFT PILLOWS on hand. But this decorative throw pillow orgy stuff has got to stop. Just leave the couch alone, and let its open empty cushions be an invitation for your guests to sit down and be comfortable.",1477,265,-0.9572,0.12,0.847,0.033

Bill Gates says we need the following equation to output 0; which means ONE OF People X Services x Energy x Carbon(per unit of energy) needs to be brought to 0. Not ALL of them need to be brought to 0. He then goes through the first 3, saying that it isn't feasible or reasonable to bring People, Services, or Energy to 0, and instead the correct solution is to try to bring Carbon produced per Unit of energy to 0. And then spends the rest of the talk talking about how other forms of low-carbon-producing energy sources. To re-iterate; it is NOT THE CASE that Bill Gates is saying (at least in this talk) that we should bring down the population size; only that it's not feasible to bring down population for the purposes of this equation. It's an infeasible option he briefly goes over as he walks through an entirely separate argument about the best place to invest energy towards reducing CO2 emissions. Destiny was granting that ""sure maybe he wants to reduce the population with birth control"" which is... not a huge concession but still not understanding the point he was making.

9784,Destiny,"My friend has become an unhinged conspiracy theorist I know this guy since we were like 4 years old. We're very close. We used to hang out a lot, travel together and share memes all day. He was very progressive and open minded.Last year, he went through hell. Lost his job, separated from his wife, totalled his car, accumulated lots of debt among other stuff. He moved back with his parents and would rarely leave the house. If you ask me, most of these bad things are consequences of his own stupid actions.Regardless, me and his other friends have been trying to reconnect with him and try to cheer him up since he is obviously depressed. We went out to chill one day and he just randomly started talking about politics, saying the most insane shit. He said things like:- Elon Musk has exposed the truth with the Hunter Biden leaks- COVID was made in the US. The truth will be revealed soon- There's a new world order. There are things that you cannot say. You guys don't even know (?)I told him that he has been spending too much time on the Internet reading conspiracy theories. He said ""Don't worry, I have done my research"". I thought he was meming but he had this 100% dead serious look on his face.He's also been espousing some really hateful homophobic views and twitter bullshit. The other day I got into an argument with him over Andrew Tate who he was defending for some reason.I'm genuinely concerned for the guy but I honestly cannot stand him anymore. It's really sad to see a close friend destroy himself so methodically and not being able to stop him. I don't know if there is anything I can do to help him.

9795,Destiny,"How using autism as an insult is damaging the autistic community. As the title says, using autism as an insult is damaging the autistic community. This is not only a problem that only exists in Destiny's community, but it has become a popular insult in many online and gaming communities in general, particularly common in immature and toxic ones, in my opinion. I don‚Äôt see this issue too much outside of the online/gaming community, it happens, but it's definitely much more common and emphasized here, and kept alive by many content creators.Using autism as an insult perpetuates the myth that autism is a bad thing and something to be ashamed of. We already face so many other problems in the autistic community, like difficulty socializing, sensory-issues, communicating, having our voices heard, fighting against public institutions that is basically the autistic equivalent of gay conversion therapy (ABA Therapy), institutions that are trying to find a cure for us, or detect autism early in the womb, in order to prevent our existence entirely, and so on, and so on.Most of us on the spectrum, have adopted so-called ""autistic masking"" behavior, which involves suppressing behaviors that are associated with autism, such as eye contact, or engaging in social behaviors that do not come naturally to us, in order to blend in. Masking can be very challenging and exhausting, and often has very negative consequences for our mental health and well-being. Some people may mask in order to avoid discrimination, stigma, or bullying, while others many do it in an attempt to be seen as ""normal"" or to avoid standing out. We might even become really good at masking to the point where you would never be able to tell, but in the end, we're just going to end up doing more damage to our mental health as a result, often developing depression, depersonalization, anxiety, burnout, and many other issues. The suicide rate among autistic adults is unfortunately much higher than the general population. Studies have found that the suicide rate among autistic individuals may be as high as 9 times higher than the general population (varies depending on the study), and up towards 10% of the general population who died by suicide, were likely autistic, but undiagnosed.Personally, I was diagnosed in my late 20's, being un-diagnosed and masking for so long, fucked me up in many ways. I had no explanation or guidance for managing life, developing anxiety and avoidant behavior, that I am still working on resoling to this day, and probably for a long time to come. Un-masking is a long, painful and difficult journey for us, but is ultimately the most and only permanent and effective solution for our mental health problems. Calling people autistic as an insult, wherever or not they're autistic, generates stigma towards autism, and contributes to the unnecessary shame that is felt in the autistic community. Are we even allowed to feel proud, being autistic? Of course, and we need your support!It is important to be mindful of the language we use and to be respectful of others, regardless of whether they have a disability or not. Using autism or any other disability as an insult should never be acceptable. Please stop this cringe and harmful behavior.Here is a few examples from Destiny, to a much more frequent issue, that I have noticed:Example 1:  &gt;**Chat**: *""Destiny the N word drama was because Denims wanted an out from the drama of \*\*\*\*ing on your bed""* **Destiny**: *""True! Of breaking into my house, letting someone else in, and fucking all over my bed for a day and a half, like* ***the autistic fucking dipshit she was.***Example 2:   &gt;**Destiny**: *Oh shit; ""I have an autistic 14 year old"" -* ***Oh I just read these as an insult.***Destiny has previously addressed a his views of using autism as an insult in the following video:  This video is 5 years old and I don't think it should be taken too seriously or relevant to his current position, whatever that might be, but nonetheless I think it would be interesting addressing a few take-away's from this video:&gt;**12:00:** *""It's not the best defense, but when you're in a community that talk a certain way, and use a certain type of insult, it seems like the only way to communicate with them, is to use their language to some extent"".*  &gt;  &gt;**12:30:** *""These types of insults (referring to more descriptive adjectives) do not really work, because if you're not communicating with them with the vernacular they use and understand as insults, you kind of have no impact, you know, it's really difficult to find that line.""*  &gt;  &gt;**16:23**: *""If there were better words to reach for that had the same impact on your audience and the people in-game and yourself, I mean, I would switch out in a heartbeat. Do you have a good solution?* **Guest***: baby-brains? \*Destiny starts laughing\**There's several other points that could be highlighted as well, even in defense of Destiny, but overall I don't think he was trying to look for excuses too much or anything like that, but I do think his opinions were extremely bad, and why they don't hold up, especially today:* Using insults that contributes towards a harmful experience for people with a disability, just so you can better fit into a community or argue a point, is damaging the disabled community purely for your own benefit.* What or who is this ""community"" or people he's trying to adhere to? His own? Destiny talked a lot about audience capture, and how he is afraid of a feedback loop, telling his fans what they want to hear. I hope he would re-visit this topic, because it's important to me.Even Sneako which has the most consistent shit-takes in my opinion, seemed to have a more respectful (however stereotypical) take on autism that Destiny did, in this clip: &gt;**Sneako**: *Hey chat, if Destiny is a high-functioning autist, how many of you think I'm a high-functioning retard?*  &gt;  &gt;**Destiny**: *What's the difference? \*Giggles\**  &gt;  &gt;**Sneako**: *Autist people are smart! \*Straight face\**I do acknowledge this comment from Destiny was most likely just intended as a joke or at best, his attempt at bad humor, but even if that's the case, it's still a bad joke with real consequences, indicating this is appropriate behavior to his audience.

Instead, he pays for a donor egg and sperm, IVF and then a surrogate mother to host the resulting foetus. Just before the foetus is able to have a conscious experience, the billionaire pays a doctor to pinch some nerve of the foetus that will make it such that the body of the foetus will continue development as normal but it will never begin having a conscious experience. The foetus is then birthed and kept on life support for however many years and then the billionaire gets to enjoy himself.# Question:If it is true that foetuses that don't begin to have conscious experience shouldn't have human rights, then the state of affairs as I described above is perfectly ok.

Every single comment she makes has the fa√ßade of curiosity and lack of knowledge, yet it creeps towards a conservative bias. She hides behind the ""dainty shy nervous"" girl voice and giggle and snickers while continuing to ask questions in bad faith- even when actually lacking knowledge on the topic. It's honestly an amazing ability she has, because pretending like she is dumber than she really is gives her an advantage over the people she talks to. You might've seen an example of this yesterday when they were talking about Andrew Tate and she claimed to not know the charges against him. When they were enumerated by our resident gnome, she followed up with a seemingly innocuous question (paraphrasing) ""were they free to leave ü•∫üëâüëà uwu?"". Technically, yes they were- but we all know from what has come out so far that it isn't that simple. Because the answer is technical, she got her foot in the door and proceeded to argue that the girls were there of their own free will and that they chose that fate to make a bunch of money. In addition to this, she was adamant that based on what she heard about Andrew Tate, he doesn't seem like the kind of person to commit the alleged crimes, even if previous to that point she didn't know much about him.If you are watching Sneako's stream, she asked similar questions regarding the world economic forum and the European unions information laws. They seem to come from a place of genuine curiosity, but upon desTiny defining these terms, she'll hint at the fact that she doesn't think they are relevant. A lot of her defenses in this stream is ""I don't know anything I'm just asking questions ‚ò∫Ô∏èüåûüåàüåàü•∞‚ú®üíÖüëë"" and then turn around to make the boldest conservative claims about the [current topic].It's so crystal clear to me (a totally stable, not schizo-poster) that her intentions are insidious and on bad faith, even if her demeanor is bubbly and happy.

This post is mainly about the current rape accusations against Kai Cenat's friend (Sack), but not limited to them.After reading about the situation, I didn't know why Kai's involvement was the most talked about. I'm not defending him; there are things he did that were wrong, but that doesn't justify crucifying him.Things that Kai did wrong that are confirmed:Delay the victim. He could've taken things to his legal team very quickly, and then his legal team could've helped her file a case against the accused rapist. Instead, he waited for days. I know he said he was muted, but still, I'm sure his legal team wouldn't have stopped him from saying that everything was going to be alright and that she would get the justice that she deserved.The Stream. A lot of people, including Destiny, criticized the way he went about it and his approach. Since I watch his streams from time to time, I know that's how he speaks. He can't articulate himself well; he can't even say a sentence without saying ""you know"" four times or repeating a filler word for two minutes. Mind you, he's a 21-year-old from the worst and poorest county in New York with a high school education.**Tldr:**  When I went to xQc's stream to see what they thought about Kai's situation (wrong place, IK), that chat was acting as if Kai was the rapist, everyone jumping down his neck, and xQc would give a little push back because the chat was being unreasonable and would get flamed himself, so he let the chat go even crazier, and the same was for HassanAbi, but it was even worse.But Destiny actually pushed back on every single point and gave his reasoning behind it, and he didn't let chat go on with their crazy assumptions.

9893,Destiny,"My thoughts on the Fresh + Fit episode with Destiny. Coming from someone who doesn't watch Youtube ""shows"" or listen to streams. I'm a bit late, but I really wanted to talk about that episode and give my take on it. I can see why someone would watch Fresh + Fit, as there is a lot of entertainment. For example, that Russian girl that was clearly on something is entertaining. However, just because it's entertaining doesn't mean it's a good thing. Watching a trainwreck is entertaining but it's nothing to write home about. And at the beginning whenever they asked the guests to ""name 3 countries"" the segment was also hilarious. But, once you take into account that most of their guests are so terminally online and obsessed with the idea of being an influencer that they will stoop to the level of actually being a guest on Fresh + Fit for clout is kind of sad. I also really like it when Myron  Destiny debate each other as there is nothing particularly toxic and is genuinely interesting. I disagree with Myron but I can totally understand some of his viewpoints and why he comes to that conclusion. If I didn't listen to Destiny I can see myself kind of falling for what he says. Sad but true. However, I can't really say the same about his co-host. That ""College women are getting flown out to Dubai"" take is utterly ridiculous. My jaw dropped to the floor when I heard that. It's such a terminally online take. I would probably say the same if I just used Instagram all day and didn't go outside. I've tried to think of an excuse for why he would say that and I just can't. I wouldn't even say that there is a portion of women in general that get flown to Dubai. To me, it seemed like that guy thinks saying stuff like that would make him feel better whenever he has troubles with other women. I don't know, perhaps I'm overreading? And who could forget Sneako! Why is it that almost every time I watch something related to Sneako that he says almost nothing the entire time and contributes very little to the conversation? It's like he's just there to occasionally do a ""funny,"" and that's it. By the way, Sneako copying Tates mannerisms and pose is so puerile; you can't help but laugh. It reminds me of when I was 13 years old and I would act like Rambo and try to be a badass. I'd be mostly silent and have a tough look while sometimes saying oneliners like ""Live for nothing, or die for something."" When you're young, that's kind of cool. But when you're an adult, it's kind of pathetic. Closing thoughts, I think their show is entertaining but the hosts themselves are too simple. Sometimes naive.",2611,478,0.9889,0.09,0.754,0.156

9897,Destiny,"The Redpill Community Isn't About Women I know it seems like it. And for the longest time I thought the community was about impressing women. Because that's all they seem to talk about. But I've come to realize redpill is actually based in impressing other men. Gaining the approval of other men. Competing with other men.Women aren't impressed by the amount of woman a guy sleeps with. Most find it gross.But men are impressed. They think you're the shit if you can fuck (not date) multiple women. You're ""the man"" if you have 4 chick's around your arm. They take it as a challenge. They're either going to try steal your girl or try fuck more women than you. That's 'the game' Women aren't impressed by fast cars. In fact if redpill ideology is to be believed that women only care about resources. They'd want an SUV. They'd want something that can take more than 2 grocery bags. They'd want something they can pick their kids up from school with. Something that didn't cost a down payment on a house.But men are impressed. They love the zoomie zoomie vroom vroom. They like the speed. They like that it costs the equivalent of 50 years of someone's rent. They want the fastest most expensive car, because other men can't.Women aren't really impressed by physique. It's important for sure. but they care more about you looking after yourself than the muscle tone. A lot of women say ""I want a man whose fit but not like fit fit. Ya know?""But men are impressed. The joke goes 'when you start working out, it's not women who compliment you more, it's other men.' They're impressed by strength and the sculpting of muscle. They want to be the strongest and the best looking.Women are impressed by a guy who can share his emotions. Someone who can open up and be vulnerable in intimate moments. Someone who shares what they think, their dreams and their fears. But men aren't impressed. The more emotion you show, they weaker you seem. The less in control you are. Men take it as a badge of honor that they don't cry. It's gay, or womanly to talk about how you feel. They value logic and reason and faaaaacts. They want to be the most rational. To be in chargeIn summary, the Redpill community is a way to connect with other men. An unhealthy connection based in competition and one uping. It's a race to the bottom to see who gets their first. Focusing on material wealth and surface level self worth. We men need healthier ways to connect with each other. It can be based in competition but it shouldn't determine your worth. We can rise together my brothers. Stay strong üí™. Stay humble üòå. Stay blessedüôè.",2604,467,0.9952,0.106,0.683,0.211

9904,Destiny,"Am I off base or is Twitter too important? With the approach of Hogwarts Legacy, there is a big outcry against supporting a billionaire transphobe.  The thing is most of this outcry is based on Twitter, which is owned by the richest transphobe in the world. Also, I would say he just objectively holds more power than JK. My stance is simple. If supporting a wealthy transphobe via purchasing a game is making a huge political statement and a transphobic one at that, then so is using Twitter.The only arguments against this position have been ""Giving money directly to JK is worse than giving ad-rev, engagement, and data to Elon"" I Doubt this one. The other is that Twitter is too important to boycott. This one may hold some more weight.",740,131,0.8999,0.113,0.682,0.205

He had a yield sign that is on the other side of the light post in the middle of the turn that is hard to see because of the angle and the fact that it is hidden behind another sign.
